TL;DR: 提出了AgentAug数据增强框架，通过模拟典型创作过程生成多样化的假新闻视频，使用LLM驱动的四种伪造类别流水线，结合基于不确定性采样的主动学习策略，提升短视频假新闻检测器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台假新闻检测面临训练数据有限且多样性不足的问题，现有数据集无法充分反映视频素材与伪造新闻事件之间的复杂多对多关系，导致检测器性能受限。

Method: 使用LLM驱动的四种伪造类别流水线模拟假新闻视频创作过程，结合基于不确定性采样的主动学习策略选择有用的增强样本。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，AgentAug能够持续提升短视频假新闻检测器的性能。

Conclusion: AgentAug通过数据增强有效解决了短视频假新闻检测中训练数据不足和多样性缺乏的问题，为假新闻检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of fake news on short video platforms has become a new
significant societal concern, necessitating automatic video-news-specific
detection. Current detectors primarily rely on pattern-based features to
separate fake news videos from real ones. However, limited and less diversified
training data lead to biased patterns and hinder their performance. This
weakness stems from the complex many-to-many relationships between video
material segments and fabricated news events in real-world scenarios: a single
video clip can be utilized in multiple ways to create different fake
narratives, while a single fabricated event often combines multiple distinct
video segments. However, existing datasets do not adequately reflect such
relationships due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating large-scale
real-world data, resulting in sparse coverage and non-comprehensive learning of
the characteristics of potential fake news video creation. To address this
issue, we propose a data augmentation framework, AgentAug, that generates
diverse fake news videos by simulating typical creative processes. AgentAug
implements multiple LLM-driven pipelines of four fabrication categories for
news video creation, combined with an active learning strategy based on
uncertainty sampling to select the potentially useful augmented samples during
training. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AgentAug consistently improves the performance of short video fake news
detectors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合transformer架构和纹理方法的集成框架，用于检测深度伪造媒体，在DFWild-Cup数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的兴起，现有检测方法难以在不同数据集和生成技术间泛化，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 集成Swin Transformers和ViTs等transformer架构与纹理方法，采用创新数据分割、顺序训练、频率分割、基于补丁的注意力和人脸分割技术。

Result: 在包含八个深度伪造数据集的DFWild-Cup数据集上实现了最先进的检测性能。

Conclusion: 混合模型能有效应对深度伪造检测的挑战，为实际应用提供鲁棒解决方案，transformer擅长全局特征提取，纹理方法提供可解释性。

Abstract: Detecting manipulated media has now become a pressing issue with the recent
rise of deepfakes. Most existing approaches fail to generalize across diverse
datasets and generation techniques. We thus propose a novel ensemble framework,
combining the strengths of transformer-based architectures, such as Swin
Transformers and ViTs, and texture-based methods, to achieve better detection
accuracy and robustness. Our method introduces innovative data-splitting,
sequential training, frequency splitting, patch-based attention, and face
segmentation techniques to handle dataset imbalances, enhance high-impact
regions (e.g., eyes and mouth), and improve generalization. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance when tested on the DFWild-Cup dataset, a diverse
subset of eight deepfake datasets. The ensemble benefits from the
complementarity of these approaches, with transformers excelling in global
feature extraction and texturebased methods providing interpretability. This
work demonstrates that hybrid models can effectively address the evolving
challenges of deepfake detection, offering a robust solution for real-world
applications.

### [3] [SoC-DT: Standard-of-Care Aligned Digital Twins for Patient-Specific Tumor Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03287)
*Moinak Bhattacharya,Gagandeep Singh,Prateek Prasanna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SoC-DT框架，结合反应扩散模型和标准治疗干预，通过可微分求解器预测肿瘤轨迹，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反应扩散模型无法捕捉异质性治疗范式下的肿瘤动态，需要能模拟标准治疗干预并考虑患者间差异的计算框架。

Method: SoC-DT统一了反应扩散肿瘤生长模型、离散标准治疗干预（手术、化疗、放疗）以及基因组和人口统计学个性化，使用IMEX-SoC隐式-显式指数时间差分求解器确保稳定性。

Result: 在合成数据和真实胶质瘤数据上评估，SoC-DT在预测肿瘤动态方面始终优于经典PDE基线和纯数据驱动的神经模型。

Conclusion: SoC-DT通过将机制可解释性与现代可微分求解器相结合，为肿瘤学中患者特异性数字孪生建立了原则性基础，实现了生物学一致的肿瘤动态估计。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of tumor trajectories under standard-of-care (SoC)
therapies remains a major unmet need in oncology. This capability is essential
for optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression.
Conventional reaction-diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to
capture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is
hence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically
simulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in
genomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care
Digital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies
reaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery,
chemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization
to predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit
exponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures
stability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated
on both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently
outperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in
predicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern
differentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for
patient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent
tumor dynamics estimation. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

### [4] [ReactDiff: Fundamental Multiple Appropriate Facial Reaction Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04712)
*Luo Cheng,Song Siyang,Yan Siyuan,Yu Zhen,Ge Zongyuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReactDiff是一个用于生成多样化面部反应的时间扩散框架，通过融入时空面部运动学和面部动作单元依赖关系来提升反应的真实性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以建模真实人类反应中的随机性和动态特性，无法生成多样化且逼真的面部反应。

Method: 提出ReactDiff时间扩散框架，融入两个关键先验：时间面部行为运动学和面部动作单元依赖关系，引导模型生成符合人类面部解剖约束的平滑连贯反应。

Result: 在REACT2024数据集上的实验表明，该方法在反应质量、多样性和反应适切性方面均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ReactDiff通过融入面部运动学和动作单元依赖关系，成功生成了多样化、逼真且适切的面部反应，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The automatic generation of diverse and human-like facial reactions in dyadic
dialogue remains a critical challenge for human-computer interaction systems.
Existing methods fail to model the stochasticity and dynamics inherent in real
human reactions. To address this, we propose ReactDiff, a novel temporal
diffusion framework for generating diverse facial reactions that are
appropriate for responding to any given dialogue context. Our key insight is
that plausible human reactions demonstrate smoothness, and coherence over time,
and conform to constraints imposed by human facial anatomy. To achieve this,
ReactDiff incorporates two vital priors (spatio-temporal facial kinematics)
into the diffusion process: i) temporal facial behavioral kinematics and ii)
facial action unit dependencies. These two constraints guide the model toward
realistic human reaction manifolds, avoiding visually unrealistic jitters,
unstable transitions, unnatural expressions, and other artifacts. Extensive
experiments on the REACT2024 dataset demonstrate that our approach not only
achieves state-of-the-art reaction quality but also excels in diversity and
reaction appropriateness.

Abstract: In an era dominated by video content, understanding its structure and
dynamics has become increasingly important. This paper presents a hybrid
framework that combines a distributed multi-GPU inference system with an
interactive visualization platform for analyzing celebrity dynamics in video
episodes. The inference framework efficiently processes large volumes of video
data by leveraging optimized ONNX models, heterogeneous batch inference, and
high-throughput parallelism, ensuring scalable generation of timestamped
appearance records. These records are then transformed into a comprehensive
suite of visualizations, including appearance frequency charts, duration
analyses, pie charts, co-appearance matrices, network graphs, stacked area
charts, seasonal comparisons, and heatmaps. Together, these visualizations
provide multi-dimensional insights into video content, revealing patterns in
celebrity prominence, screen-time distribution, temporal dynamics,
co-appearance relationships, and intensity across episodes and seasons. The
interactive nature of the system allows users to dynamically explore data,
identify key moments, and uncover evolving relationships between individuals.
By bridging distributed recognition with structured, visually-driven analytics,
this work enables new possibilities for entertainment analytics, content
creation strategies, and audience engagement studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ExposureEngine系统，使用定向边界框(OBB)来准确量化体育转播中的赞助商可见度，解决了传统水平边界框(HBB)在旋转或倾斜标志检测中的不准确问题。

Abstract: Quantifying sponsor visibility in sports broadcasts is a critical marketing
task traditionally hindered by manual, subjective, and unscalable analysis
methods. While automated systems offer an alternative, their reliance on
axis-aligned Horizontal Bounding Box (HBB) leads to inaccurate exposuremetrics
when logos appear rotated or skewed due to dynamic camera angles and
perspective distortions. This paper introduces ExposureEngine, an end-to-end
system designed for accurate, rotation-aware sponsor visibility analytics in
sports broadcasts, demonstrated in a soccer case study. Our approach predicts
Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) to provide a geometrically precise fit to each logo
regardless of the orientation on-screen. To train and evaluate our detector, we
developed a new dataset comprising 1,103 frames from Swedish elite soccer,
featuring 670 unique sponsor logos annotated with OBBs. Our model achieves a
mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.859, with a precision of 0.96 and recall
of 0.87, demonstrating robust performance in localizing logos under diverse
broadcast conditions. The system integrates these detections into an analytical
pipeline that calculates precise visibility metrics, such as exposure duration
and on-screen coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate a language-driven agentic
layer, enabling users to generate reports, summaries, and media content through
natural language queries. The complete system, including the dataset and the
analytics dashboard, provides a comprehensive solution for auditable and
interpretable sponsor measurement in sports media. An overview of the
ExposureEngine is available online: https://youtu.be/tRw6OBISuW4 .

### [7] [Domain-Robust Marine Plastic Detection Using Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03294)
*Saanvi Kataria*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多种深度学习模型在水下塑料垃圾跨域检测中的性能，发现轻量级CNN模型MobileNetV2表现最佳，而零样本模型CLIP和Gemini各具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋塑料污染是紧迫的环境威胁，需要可靠的水下垃圾自动检测系统。但由于域偏移问题，在一个数据集上训练的视觉系统在新图像上性能会下降。

Method: 在标记的水下数据集上训练CNN（MobileNetV2、ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0）和视觉变换器（DeiT-Tiny、ViT-B16），然后在来自不同来源的跨域测试集上评估。同时评估了两个零样本模型CLIP ViT-L14和Google Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Result: 轻量级MobileNetV2在跨域性能上表现最佳（F1 0.97），所有微调模型都实现了高精度（约99%），但在召回率上存在差异。零样本CLIP敏感但易产生假阳性，Gemini则相反。

Conclusion: 经过监督训练的紧凑CNN可以有效地泛化到跨域水下检测，而大型预训练视觉语言模型提供了互补优势。

Abstract: Marine plastic pollution is a pressing environmental threat, making reliable
automation for underwater debris detection essential. However, vision systems
trained on one dataset often degrade on new imagery due to domain shift. This
study benchmarks models for cross-domain robustness, training convolutional
neural networks - CNNs (MobileNetV2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (DeiT-Tiny, ViT-B16) on a labeled underwater dataset and then
evaluates them on a balanced cross-domain test set built from plastic-positive
images drawn from a different source and negatives from the training domain.
Two zero-shot models were assessed, CLIP ViT-L14 and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash,
that leverage pretraining to classify images without fine-tuning. Results show
the lightweight MobileNetV2 delivers the strongest cross-domain performance (F1
0.97), surpassing larger models. All fine-tuned models achieved high Precision
(around 99%), but differ in Recall, indicating varying sensitivity to plastic
instances. Zero-shot CLIP is comparatively sensitive (Recall around 80%) yet
prone to false positives (Precision around 56%), whereas Gemini exhibits the
inverse profile (Precision around 99%, Recall around 81%). Error analysis
highlights recurring confusions with coral textures, suspended particulates,
and specular glare. Overall, compact CNNs with supervised training can
generalize effectively for cross-domain underwater detection, while large
pretrained vision-language models provide complementary strengths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术演示视频已成为研究交流的重要媒介，但制作过程高度劳动密集，需要数小时的幻灯片设计、录制和编辑。现有方法面临研究论文输入、密集多模态信息以及多个对齐通道协调的独特挑战。

Conclusion: PaperTalker建立了学术演示视频生成的基准和框架，通过多智能体方法有效解决了多模态信息协调的挑战，为研究交流提供了实用的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research
communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often
requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10
minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves
distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal
information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple
aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To
address these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101
research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and
speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta
Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos
convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we
propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation
video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout
refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,
subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing
slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate
that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and
informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward
automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and
code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.

### [9] [Multimodal Arabic Captioning with Interpretable Visual Concept Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03295)
*Passant Elchafei,Amany Fashwan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLCAP是一个阿拉伯语图像描述框架，结合CLIP视觉标签检索和多模态文本生成，通过可解释的阿拉伯视觉概念生成文化连贯的阿拉伯语图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端图像描述方法缺乏可解释性，VLCAP旨在通过基于视觉概念的生成方法，为阿拉伯语图像描述提供更可解释和文化连贯的解决方案。

Method: 使用三种多语言编码器(mCLIP、AraCLIP、Jina V4)进行视觉标签检索，构建包含训练描述和Visual Genome翻译标签的混合词汇表，然后将检索到的标签转换为阿拉伯语提示，与图像一起输入视觉语言模型(Qwen-VL和Gemini Pro Vision)生成描述。

Result: mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision组合在BLEU-1(5.34%)和余弦相似度(60.01%)上表现最佳，AraCLIP + Qwen-VL在LLM-judge评分(36.33%)上最高。

Conclusion: VLCAP的可解释流水线能够生成文化连贯且上下文准确的阿拉伯语图像描述，为阿拉伯语多模态AI提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present VLCAP, an Arabic image captioning framework that integrates
CLIP-based visual label retrieval with multimodal text generation. Rather than
relying solely on end-to-end captioning, VLCAP grounds generation in
interpretable Arabic visual concepts extracted with three multilingual
encoders, mCLIP, AraCLIP, and Jina V4, each evaluated separately for label
retrieval. A hybrid vocabulary is built from training captions and enriched
with about 21K general domain labels translated from the Visual Genome dataset,
covering objects, attributes, and scenes. The top-k retrieved labels are
transformed into fluent Arabic prompts and passed along with the original image
to vision-language models. In the second stage, we tested Qwen-VL and Gemini
Pro Vision for caption generation, resulting in six encoder-decoder
configurations. The results show that mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision achieved the
best BLEU-1 (5.34%) and cosine similarity (60.01%), while AraCLIP + Qwen-VL
obtained the highest LLM-judge score (36.33%). This interpretable pipeline
enables culturally coherent and contextually accurate Arabic captions.

*Akshar Gothi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对比EfficientNet-B0和ViT-Base在SpaceNet数据集上的性能，分别在自然不平衡和平衡重采样两种标签分布下进行测试，评估准确率、F1分数、模型大小和延迟等指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较卷积神经网络和视觉Transformer在不同数据分布下的性能差异，特别是在不平衡和平衡数据集上的表现，以及它们在效率和准确性方面的权衡。

Method: 在SpaceNet数据集上进行控制实验，使用两种标签分布：自然不平衡的五类分割和平衡重采样分割（每类700张图像）。采用相同的预处理（224x224，ImageNet归一化）、轻量级数据增强，在单个NVIDIA P100上训练40个周期。

Result: 在不平衡分割上，EfficientNet-B0达到93%测试准确率，具有更好的宏F1分数和更低延迟；ViT-Base同样达到93%但参数更多、运行时间更长。在平衡分割上，两者表现都很强，EfficientNet-B0达到99%，ViT-Base保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 数据平衡缩小了架构差距，但CNN在效率方面仍保持优势。EfficientNet-B0在不平衡和平衡数据集上都表现出色，而ViT-Base在平衡数据上能够缩小性能差距。

Abstract: We present a controlled comparison of a convolutional neural network
(EfficientNet-B0) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) on SpaceNet under two
label-distribution regimes: a naturally imbalanced five-class split and a
balanced-resampled split with 700 images per class (70:20:10 train/val/test).
With matched preprocessing (224x224, ImageNet normalization), lightweight
augmentations, and a 40-epoch budget on a single NVIDIA P100, we report
accuracy, macro-F1, balanced accuracy, per-class recall, and deployment metrics
(model size and latency). On the imbalanced split, EfficientNet-B0 reaches 93%
test accuracy with strong macro-F1 and lower latency; ViT-Base is competitive
at 93% with a larger parameter count and runtime. On the balanced split, both
models are strong; EfficientNet-B0 reaches 99% while ViT-Base remains
competitive, indicating that balancing narrows architecture gaps while CNNs
retain an efficiency edge. We release manifests, logs, and per-image
predictions to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, remains a critical global challenge, as conventional
infrastructure-based measures often prove inadequate in dynamic urban
environments. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in
visual perception and reasoning, open new opportunities for proactive and
context-aware VRU protection. However, existing surveys on AI applications for
VRUs predominantly focus on detection, offering limited coverage of other
vision-based tasks that are essential for comprehensive VRU understanding and
protection. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent progress in
camera-based AI sensing systems for VRU safety, with an emphasis on
developments from the past five years and emerging research trends. We
systematically examine four core tasks, namely detection and classification,
tracking and reidentification, trajectory prediction, and intent recognition
and prediction, which together form the backbone of AI-empowered proactive
solutions for VRU protection in intelligent transportation systems. To guide
future research, we highlight four major open challenges from the perspectives
of data, model, and deployment. By linking advances in visual AI with practical
considerations for real-world implementation, this survey aims to provide a
foundational reference for the development of next-generation sensing systems
to enhance VRU safety.

TL;DR: 地球观测基础模型对传感器架构高度敏感，理解这种差异对模型设计和应用至关重要

Motivation: 现有地球观测基础模型大多在单一模态数据上训练，但被应用于跨模态任务，不清楚不同传感器架构对模型内部表示的影响

Method: 分析地球观测基础模型的表示空间对传感器架构的敏感性

Result: 发现地球观测基础模型的表示空间对传感器架构高度敏感

Conclusion: 理解传感器架构差异对模型表示的影响，为地球观测基础模型的稳健设计和发展提供了重要指导

Abstract: Earth Observation Foundation Models (EOFMs) have exploded in prevalence as
tools for processing the massive volumes of remotely sensed and other earth
observation data, and for delivering impact on the many essential earth
monitoring tasks. An emerging trend posits using the outputs of pre-trained
models as 'embeddings' which summarize high dimensional data to be used for
generic tasks such as similarity search and content-specific queries. However,
most EOFM models are trained only on single modalities of data and then applied
or benchmarked by matching bands across different modalities. It is not clear
from existing work what impact diverse sensor architectures have on the
internal representations of the present suite of EOFMs. We show in this work
that the representation space of EOFMs is highly sensitive to sensor
architecture and that understanding this difference gives a vital perspective
on the pitfalls of current EOFM design and signals for how to move forward as
model developers, users, and a community guided by robust remote-sensing
science.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于修复引导的扰动解释技术，通过生成逼真的局部编辑来揭示视觉模型在生态监测中的决策依据，特别应用于海豹检测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态监测中视觉模型的预测不透明限制了信任和实际应用，需要可解释的方法来揭示模型决策的形态学线索。

Method: 使用修复引导的扰动技术，结合Segment-Anything-Model优化的掩码，进行物体移除/替换和背景替换等干预，生成保持场景上下文的逼真编辑。

Conclusion: 该解释技术支持专家验证，为生态学中AI的更可信部署提供了领域相关的洞察力。

Abstract: Ecological monitoring is increasingly automated by vision models, yet opaque
predictions limit trust and field adoption. We present an inpainting-guided,
perturbation-based explanation technique that produces photorealistic,
mask-localized edits that preserve scene context. Unlike masking or blurring,
these edits stay in-distribution and reveal which fine-grained morphological
cues drive predictions in tasks such as species recognition and trait
attribution. We demonstrate the approach on a YOLOv9 detector fine-tuned for
harbor seal detection in Glacier Bay drone imagery, using
Segment-Anything-Model-refined masks to support two interventions: (i) object
removal/replacement (e.g., replacing seals with plausible ice/water or boats)
and (ii) background replacement with original animals composited onto new
scenes. Explanations are assessed by re-scoring perturbed images (flip rate,
confidence drop) and by expert review for ecological plausibility and
interpretability. The resulting explanations localize diagnostic structures,
avoid deletion artifacts common to traditional perturbations, and yield
domain-relevant insights that support expert validation and more trustworthy
deployment of AI in ecology.

Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) stands as a cornerstone in medical image
analysis, playing a pivotal role in precise diagnostics, treatment planning,
and monitoring of various medical conditions. This paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic survey of MIS methodologies, bridging the gap
between traditional image processing techniques and modern deep learning
approaches. The survey encompasses thresholding, edge detection, region-based
segmentation, clustering algorithms, and model-based techniques while also
delving into state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), and the widely
adopted U-Net and its variants. Moreover, integrating attention mechanisms,
semi-supervised learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and
Transformer-based models is thoroughly explored. In addition to covering
established methods, this survey highlights emerging trends, including hybrid
architectures, cross-modality learning, federated and distributed learning
frameworks, and active learning strategies, which aim to address challenges
such as limited labeled datasets, computational complexity, and model
generalizability across diverse imaging modalities. Furthermore, a specialized
case study on lumbar spine segmentation is presented, offering insights into
the challenges and advancements in this relatively underexplored anatomical
region. Despite significant progress in the field, critical challenges persist,
including dataset bias, domain adaptation, interpretability of deep learning
models, and integration into real-world clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DECOR是一种面向晶圆缺陷检测的深度聚类框架，通过考虑晶圆图的方向变化，能够在不完美数据条件下可靠地对复杂缺陷模式进行聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体制造中晶圆缺陷的早期检测对产品良率优化至关重要，但原始晶圆数据通常复杂、未标记、不平衡且可能包含多种缺陷，需要设计在非理想数据条件下仍可靠的聚类方法。

Method: DECOR框架通过深度聚类结合方向鲁棒性，明确考虑晶圆图的方向变化，确保空间相似的缺陷无论旋转或对齐如何都能被一致地聚类。

Result: 在MixedWM38数据集上的实验表明，DECOR能够无需手动调参即可发现聚类，且性能优于现有的聚类基线方法。

Conclusion: DECOR为自动化视觉检测系统提供了一个可靠且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, early detection of wafer defects is critical
for product yield optimization. However, raw wafer data from wafer quality
tests are often complex, unlabeled, imbalanced and can contain multiple defects
on a single wafer, making it crucial to design clustering methods that remain
reliable under such imperfect data conditions. We introduce DECOR, a deep
clustering with orientation robustness framework that groups complex defect
patterns from wafer maps into consistent clusters. We evaluate our method on
the open source MixedWM38 dataset, demonstrating its ability to discover
clusters without manual tuning. DECOR explicitly accounts for orientation
variations in wafer maps, ensuring that spatially similar defects are
consistently clustered regardless of its rotation or alignment. Experiments
indicate that our method outperforms existing clustering baseline methods, thus
providing a reliable and scalable solution in automated visual inspection
systems.

*Andrey A. Lebedev,Victor B. Kazantsev,Sergey V. Stasenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LSTM和注意力机制的面部表情分类方法，专门针对类别不平衡问题。通过在训练时排除一个类别，然后进行错误校正，证明了该方法在恢复被排除类别方面的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部表情分类中的类别不平衡问题，其中某些情绪类别显著多于其他类别，这在实际应用中很常见。

Method: 使用基于LSTM的神经网络模型，结合注意力机制聚焦于面部关键区域。实验采用六类训练、一类排除的方式，然后对排除的类别进行错误校正。

Result: 校正对所有类别都有效，但成功率不同。在测试样本中，对小类别的关键质量指标有所提升，表明该方法在寻找罕见事件方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效应用于面部表情分析系统，以及在类别分布倾斜情况下需要稳定分类的任务中，特别是在反欺诈等寻找罕见事件的场景中。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of error correction in multi-class
classification of face images on unbalanced samples. The study is based on the
analysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional
states of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem
of class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others.
To solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with
an attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative
for emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is
trained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with
subsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training
stage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although
the degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are
worse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an
increase in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates
the promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the
search for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed
method can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in
tasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在静态图表生成和理解方面取得显著进展，但在动态图表生成和理解方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 构建了DCG-8K高质量数据集，包含指令-代码-视频三元组和QA对；提出了两阶段训练方法，使用联合代码-视觉奖励进行群组相对策略优化。

Result: 基准测试揭示了现有MLLM在视觉到图表任务中的不足；提出的模型在三个任务上平均性能提升8.31%，仅用3B参数就达到了与专有模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的训练方法有效，模型在动态图表生成任务中表现出色，代码和数据集将公开可用。

Abstract: Dynamic Chart Generation (DCG) involves producing code-rendered animated
visualizations as charts. While recent advances in multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs) have significantly improved their capability on static chart
generation and comprehension, MLLMs' potential for handling dynamic chart
generation and understanding remains underexplored. To bridge this research
gap, we introduce DCG-Bench (Dynamic Chart Generation Benchmark), the first
benchmark evaluating MLLM's capability on dynamic chart generation tasks from
three dimensions: Simple Text-to-Chart, Detailed Text-to-Chart, and
Video-to-Chart tasks. We construct DCG-8K, a high-quality DCG dataset with
annotations covering instruction-code-video triplets and QA pairs for both code
and video evaluation. Based on DCG-8K, we explored a two-stage training recipe,
proposing Joint-Code-Visual Reward for group relative policy optimization to
construct expert MLLM Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B for the DCG task. Our benchmarking
result reveals shortcomings of existing MLLMs in the visual-to-chart task, and
our model beats the best open-sourced MLLM with an average 8.31% performance
gain across three tasks, and shows on par performance against proprietary
models with only 3B parameters, proving the effectiveness of our training
recipe. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VoT（视觉里程计Transformer），一种端到端的单目视觉里程计方法，无需手工组件如捆绑调整、特征匹配、相机标定或稠密3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单目视觉里程计方法通常结合预训练深度学习组件和优化模块，导致复杂流程，严重依赖相机标定和超参数调优，在未见过的真实场景中表现不佳。

Method: VoT通过时空注意力处理单目帧序列，提取特征并建模全局关系，直接预测相机运动而无需估计稠密几何，仅使用相机位姿进行监督。框架模块化灵活，可集成各种预训练编码器作为特征提取器。

Result: 实验结果表明VoT能有效扩展到更大数据集，从更强的预训练骨干网络中显著受益，在不同相机运动和标定设置下具有良好泛化性，性能优于传统方法且运行速度快3倍以上。

Conclusion: 单目视觉里程计可以通过端到端方式有效解决，VoT展示了这种方法的可行性和优势。

Abstract: Modern monocular visual odometry methods typically combine pre-trained deep
learning components with optimization modules, resulting in complex pipelines
that rely heavily on camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning, and often
struggle in unseen real-world scenarios. Recent large-scale 3D models trained
on massive amounts of multi-modal data have partially alleviated these
challenges, providing generalizable dense reconstruction and camera pose
estimation. Still, they remain limited in handling long videos and providing
accurate per-frame estimates, which are required for visual odometry. In this
work, we demonstrate that monocular visual odometry can be addressed
effectively in an end-to-end manner, thereby eliminating the need for
handcrafted components such as bundle adjustment, feature matching, camera
calibration, or dense 3D reconstruction. We introduce VoT, short for Visual
odometry Transformer, which processes sequences of monocular frames by
extracting features and modeling global relationships through temporal and
spatial attention. Unlike prior methods, VoT directly predicts camera motion
without estimating dense geometry and relies solely on camera poses for
supervision. The framework is modular and flexible, allowing seamless
integration of various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. Experimental
results demonstrate that VoT scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits
substantially from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse
camera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods
while running more than 3 times faster. The code will be released.

Conclusion: 提出的侧信息搜索方法为扩散模型在逆问题中的应用提供了更准确可靠的重建方案，是对梯度引导方法的有力替代。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse
problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that
could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely
ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search
algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a
manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate
and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based
guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be
seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image
reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse
problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring
tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that
our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance
of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior
performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward
gradient-based guidance algorithms. The code is available at

availability. The scarcity of publicly available, well-annotated sonar image
datasets creates a significant bottleneck for the development of robust machine

publicly accessible datasets across various sonar modalities, including Side
Scan Sonar (SSS), Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS), Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS),
Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES), and Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar
(DIDSON). An analysis was conducted on applications such as classification,
detection, segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. This work focuses on
state-of-the-art advancements, incorporating newly released datasets. The
findings are synthesized into a master table and a chronological timeline,
offering a clear and accessible comparison of characteristics, sizes, and

Conclusion: 溯源网络为现有可解释性技术提供了补充方法，虽然增加了计算成本且目前适用于中等规模数据集，但显著提升了神经模型的透明度、鲁棒性和可信度。

Abstract: We introduce provenance networks, a novel class of neural models designed to
provide end-to-end, training-data-driven explainability. Unlike conventional
post-hoc methods, provenance networks learn to link each prediction directly to
its supporting training examples as part of the model's normal operation,
embedding interpretability into the architecture itself. Conceptually, the
model operates similarly to a learned KNN, where each output is justified by
concrete exemplars weighted by relevance in the feature space. This approach
facilitates systematic investigations of the trade-off between memorization and
generalization, enables verification of whether a given input was included in
the training set, aids in the detection of mislabeled or anomalous data points,
enhances resilience to input perturbations, and supports the identification of
similar inputs contributing to the generation of a new data point. By jointly
optimizing the primary task and the explainability objective, provenance
networks offer insights into model behavior that traditional deep networks
cannot provide. While the model introduces additional computational cost and
currently scales to moderately sized datasets, it provides a complementary
approach to existing explainability techniques. In particular, it addresses
critical challenges in modern deep learning, including model opaqueness,
hallucination, and the assignment of credit to data contributors, thereby
improving transparency, robustness, and trustworthiness in neural models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督异常检测方法存在匹配噪声问题，且单模态和多模态方法研究相对孤立，缺乏统一框架来提升检测能力。

Method: 构建异常成本体积，通过可学习的过滤模块和多层注意力引导来减轻匹配噪声，突出细微异常。

Conclusion: UCF是一个通用的后处理细化框架，能有效提升无监督异常检测的性能，为单模态和多模态UAD提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to identify image- and pixel-level
anomalies using only normal training data, with wide applications such as
industrial inspection and medical analysis, where anomalies are scarce due to
privacy concerns and cold-start constraints. Existing methods, whether
reconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based
(pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level
matching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely
overlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal
RGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D
and RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models.
Despite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a
comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate
unified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching
perspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a
generic post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any
UAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against
normal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable
filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample,
mitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in
enhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art
results in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB--3D, RGB--Text) UAD
scenarios. Code and models will be released at

Conclusion: 提出的VLM框架填补了工业图纸数字化过程中对象检测质量自动评估的空白，为构建更可靠的数字孪生系统提供了技术支持。

Abstract: Industrial diagrams such as piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are
essential for the design, operation, and maintenance of industrial plants.
Converting these diagrams into digital form is an important step toward
building digital twins and enabling intelligent industrial automation. A
central challenge in this digitalization process is accurate object detection.
Although recent advances have significantly improved object detection
algorithms, there remains a lack of methods to automatically evaluate the
quality of their outputs. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a
framework that employs Visual Language Models (VLMs) to assess object detection
results and guide their refinement. The approach exploits the multimodal
capabilities of VLMs to identify missing or inconsistent detections, thereby
enabling automated quality assessment and improving overall detection
performance on complex industrial diagrams.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal reasoning but still
face challenges in spatial reasoning for 3D scenes and complex object
configurations. To address this, we introduce SpatialViLT, an enhanced VLM that
integrates spatial features like depth maps, 3D coordinates, and edge maps

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两相光学切片结构照明显微镜中，减少采集时间会引入残留伪影，传统去噪方法难以有效抑制，且缺乏干净的监督训练数据

Method: 使用非对称去噪自编码器和U-Net网络，通过将真实伪影场应用于合成图像来创建合成训练对，然后在真实OS-SI图像上进行评估

Result: 两种网络都提高了图像清晰度，各自在不同类型的伪影上表现优异

Conclusion: 合成训练能够实现OS-SI图像的监督去噪，编码器-解码器网络有潜力简化重建工作流程

Abstract: Structured illumination (SI) enhances image resolution and contrast by
projecting patterned light onto a sample. In two-phase optical-sectioning SI
(OS-SI), reduced acquisition time introduces residual artifacts that
conventional denoising struggles to suppress. Deep learning offers an
alternative to traditional methods; however, supervised training is limited by
the lack of clean, optically sectioned ground-truth data. We investigate
encoder-decoder networks for artifact reduction in two-phase OS-SI, using
synthetic training pairs formed by applying real artifact fields to synthetic
images. An asymmetrical denoising autoencoder (DAE) and a U-Net are trained on
the synthetic data, then evaluated on real OS-SI images. Both networks improve
image clarity, with each excelling against different artifact types. These
results demonstrate that synthetic training enables supervised denoising of
OS-SI images and highlight the potential of encoder-decoder networks to
streamline reconstruction workflows.

Motivation: 现有多模态方法主要依赖少量高变基因，限制了预测范围并忽视了协调的生物学程序对组织表型的影响。

Method: 使用ssGSEA计算通路激活分数，通过transformer编码生物学通路信号，并通过对比学习与组织学特征对齐。

Result: 在三个癌症ST数据集上，PEaRL在基因和通路水平表达预测方面均优于现有方法，Pearson相关系数分别提高达58.9%和20.4%。

Conclusion: 基于通路的转录组表示能产生更生物学忠实和可解释的多模态模型，推动计算病理学超越基因水平嵌入。

Abstract: Integrating histopathology with spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides a
powerful opportunity to link tissue morphology with molecular function. Yet
most existing multimodal approaches rely on a small set of highly variable
genes, which limits predictive scope and overlooks the coordinated biological
programs that shape tissue phenotypes. We present PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced
Representation Learning), a multimodal framework that represents
transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA. By
encoding biologically coherent pathway signals with a transformer and aligning
them with histology features via contrastive learning, PEaRL reduces
dimensionality, improves interpretability, and strengthens cross-modal
correspondence. Across three cancer ST datasets (breast, skin, and lymph node),
PEaRL consistently outperforms SOTA methods, yielding higher accuracy for both
gene- and pathway-level expression prediction (up to 58.9 percent and 20.4
percent increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to SOTA). These
results demonstrate that grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways
produces more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models,
advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings.

semantic prompts for fine-grained control over the analysis task, a capability
absent in prior universal models. To enable extensibility to other medical
tasks, it includes a hierarchical, text-controlled architecture driven by a
unique dual-prompt mechanism. For segmentation, DuPLUS is able to generalize
across three imaging modalities, ten different anatomically various medical
datasets, encompassing more than 30 organs and tumor types. It outperforms the
state-of-the-art task specific and universal models on 8 out of 10 datasets. We
demonstrate extensibility of its text-controlled architecture by seamless
integration of electronic health record (EHR) data for prognosis prediction,
and on a head and neck cancer dataset, DuPLUS achieved a Concordance Index (CI)
of 0.69. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables rapid adaptation to new tasks
and modalities from varying centers, establishing DuPLUS as a versatile and
clinically relevant solution for medical image analysis. The code for this work

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种移动优化的两阶段深度学习框架，通过线程化并行YOLOv10检测和MobileSAM分割，在计算资源有限的自然环境中实现实时动物检测和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野生动物保护需要非侵入性监测，但现有方法在计算资源有限和物种隐蔽外观方面面临挑战。

Method: 集成线程检测模型(TDM)，并行执行YOLOv10检测和MobileSAM轻量级分割，通过线程化减少延迟。

Result: 在Houbara鸨上达到mAP50 0.9627、mAP75 0.7731、mAP95 0.7178，MobileSAM mIoU 0.7421，YOLOv10每帧处理时间43.7毫秒。

Conclusion: 该框架在实时性能和准确性方面表现优异，为野生动物保护提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time animal detection and segmentation in natural environments are vital
for wildlife conservation, enabling non-invasive monitoring through remote
camera streams. However, these tasks remain challenging due to limited
computational resources and the cryptic appearance of many species. We propose
a mobile-optimized two-stage deep learning framework that integrates a
Threading Detection Model (TDM) to parallelize YOLOv10-based detection and
MobileSAM-based segmentation. Unlike prior YOLO+SAM pipelines, our approach
improves real-time performance by reducing latency through threading. YOLOv10
handles detection while MobileSAM performs lightweight segmentation, both
executed concurrently for efficient resource use. On the cryptic Houbara
Bustard, a conservation-priority species, our model achieves mAP50 of 0.9627,
mAP75 of 0.7731, mAP95 of 0.7178, and a MobileSAM mIoU of 0.7421. YOLOv10
operates at 43.7 ms per frame, confirming real-time readiness. We introduce a
curated Houbara dataset of 40,000 annotated images to support model training
and evaluation across diverse conditions. The code and dataset used in this
study are publicly available on GitHub at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Platonic Transformer通过引入柏拉图立体对称群的参考框架，在保持标准Transformer架构和计算成本的同时，实现了对连续平移和柏拉图对称性的等变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer缺乏对科学和计算机视觉中常见几何对称性的归纳偏置，而现有的等变方法通常通过复杂计算设计牺牲了Transformer的效率和灵活性。

Method: 通过定义相对于柏拉图立体对称群参考框架的注意力机制，引入原则性的权重共享方案，该方法在形式上等同于动态群卷积。

Result: 在计算机视觉(CIFAR-10)、3D点云(ScanObjectNN)和分子性质预测(QM9, OMol25)等多个基准测试中，Platonic Transformer通过利用几何约束实现了有竞争力的性能，且无需额外成本。

Conclusion: Platonic Transformer成功解决了Transformer在几何对称性方面的局限性，在保持原有架构和计算效率的同时实现了等变性，为几何感知的深度学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While widespread, Transformers lack inductive biases for geometric symmetries
common in science and computer vision. Existing equivariant methods often
sacrifice the efficiency and flexibility that make Transformers so effective
through complex, computationally intensive designs. We introduce the Platonic
Transformer to resolve this trade-off. By defining attention relative to
reference frames from the Platonic solid symmetry groups, our method induces a
principled weight-sharing scheme. This enables combined equivariance to
continuous translations and Platonic symmetries, while preserving the exact
architecture and computational cost of a standard Transformer. Furthermore, we
show that this attention is formally equivalent to a dynamic group convolution,
which reveals that the model learns adaptive geometric filters and enables a
highly scalable, linear-time convolutional variant. Across diverse benchmarks
in computer vision (CIFAR-10), 3D point clouds (ScanObjectNN), and molecular
property prediction (QM9, OMol25), the Platonic Transformer achieves
competitive performance by leveraging these geometric constraints at no
additional cost.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在未知领域的泛化能力仍然是一个重大挑战，特别是在语义分割任务中，这在生物医学和自动驾驶等领域具有重要应用价值。

Method: 通过聚类和回顾现有方法，识别研究趋势，特别是向基础模型范式的转变，并进行广泛的性能比较分析。

Result: 研究发现基础模型对领域泛化有显著影响，性能比较显示了不同方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该调查旨在推动领域泛化研究发展，并激励科学家探索新的研究方向。

Abstract: The generalization of deep neural networks to unknown domains is a major
challenge despite their tremendous progress in recent years. For this reason,
the dynamic area of domain generalization (DG) has emerged. In contrast to
unsupervised domain adaptation, there is no access to or knowledge about the
target domains, and DG methods aim to generalize across multiple different
unseen target domains. Domain generalization is particularly relevant for the
task semantic segmentation which is used in several areas such as biomedicine
or automated driving. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
rapidly evolving topic of domain generalized semantic segmentation. We cluster
and review existing approaches and identify the paradigm shift towards
foundation-model-based domain generalization. Finally, we provide an extensive
performance comparison of all approaches, which highlights the significant
influence of foundation models on domain generalization. This survey seeks to
advance domain generalization research and inspire scientists to explore new
research directions.

TL;DR: 提出基于transformer的自动化内窥镜报告生成模型，通过两阶段训练框架减轻胃肠科医生的文档负担


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜检查的文档记录工作给胃肠科医生带来沉重负担，导致临床工作流程效率低下和医生职业倦怠

Method: 使用基于transformer的视觉编码器和文本解码器，采用两阶段训练：先在图像/文本对上进行预训练，再在图像/报告对上进行微调

Result: 模型能够生成具有临床意义的检查发现，简化文档记录流程

Conclusion: 该方法有望减轻医生工作负担并改善患者护理

Abstract: Endoscopic procedures such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and
colonoscopy play a critical role in diagnosing and managing gastrointestinal
(GI) disorders. However, the documentation burden associated with these
procedures place significant strain on gastroenterologists, contributing to
inefficiencies in clinical workflows and physician burnout. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel automated report generation model that leverages
a transformer-based vision encoder and text decoder within a two-stage training
framework. In the first stage, both components are pre-trained on image/text
caption pairs to capture generalized vision-language features, followed by
fine-tuning on images/report pairs to generate clinically meaningful findings.
Our approach not only streamlines the documentation process but also holds
promise for reducing physician workload and improving patient care.

TL;DR: SketchPlan是一个基于扩散模型的无人机路径规划系统，通过手绘草图在深度图像上生成3D飞行路径，实现零样本模拟到现实的迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何让无人机通过简单的手绘草图理解人类意图并生成安全准确的3D飞行路径，特别是在未见过的真实环境中。

Method: 系统包含SketchAdapter（将手绘草图映射到2D投影路径）和DiffPath（从2D投影和深度图像推断3D轨迹的扩散模型），使用合成数据集（32k自动标注路径+872人工标注草图）进行训练。

Result: 在真实世界无人机测试中，低/中等障碍物环境下成功率100%，高障碍物环境下成功率40%，比关键消融实验高出20-60%的任务完成率。

Conclusion: 混合人工标注和自动标注数据的训练方法，结合模块化设计，显著提升了系统理解人类意图和推断3D路径的能力，实现了有效的零样本模拟到现实迁移。

Abstract: We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D
hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone
navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to
map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model
that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth
image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate
and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train
the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set
of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data
by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and
use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D
sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label
872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the
SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate
SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and
show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled
data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to
correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests,
SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen
high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task
completion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个基于姿态表达潜空间的生物特征泄漏防御方法，通过对比学习编码器分离身份信息与姿态表情，实时检测视频会议中的身份劫持攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI视频会议系统使用紧凑的姿态表达潜空间传输，但该潜空间可被操纵用于劫持受害者身份，而现有深度伪造检测器对完全合成的帧无效。

Method: 使用姿态条件的大间隔对比编码器，从传输的潜空间中分离持久身份特征，消除瞬态姿态和表情影响，通过余弦相似度检测非法身份交换。

Result: 在多个说话人生成模型上的实验表明，该方法优于现有防御方法，支持实时操作，并对分布外场景具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法首次在不查看重建RGB视频的情况下，利用潜空间中的生物特征信息有效防御身份劫持攻击，为视频会议安全提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: AI-based talking-head videoconferencing systems reduce bandwidth by sending a
compact pose-expression latent and re-synthesizing RGB at the receiver, but
this latent can be puppeteered, letting an attacker hijack a victim's likeness
in real time. Because every frame is synthetic, deepfake and synthetic video
detectors fail outright. To address this security problem, we exploit a key
observation: the pose-expression latent inherently contains biometric
information of the driving identity. Therefore, we introduce the first
biometric leakage defense without ever looking at the reconstructed RGB video:
a pose-conditioned, large-margin contrastive encoder that isolates persistent
identity cues inside the transmitted latent while cancelling transient pose and
expression. A simple cosine test on this disentangled embedding flags illicit
identity swaps as the video is rendered. Our experiments on multiple
talking-head generation models show that our method consistently outperforms
existing puppeteering defenses, operates in real-time, and shows strong
generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REVEL提出了一种新的流式拖拽视频编辑任务，允许用户通过精细的拖拽操作随时修改生成的视频内容。DragStream方法通过自适应分布自校正和空间频率选择性优化来解决潜在空间漂移和上下文干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视频扩散模型难以实现流式、细粒度的输出控制，无法保证与用户期望的一致性。需要一种能够支持任意时间、任意内容的交互式视频编辑方法。

Method: 提出训练无关的DragStream方法，包含：1）自适应分布自校正策略，利用相邻帧统计约束潜在嵌入漂移；2）空间频率选择性优化机制，选择性传播视觉线索以减少上下文干扰。

Result: DragStream可以无缝集成到现有自回归视频扩散模型中，实验证明该方法在流式拖拽视频编辑方面具有显著效果。

Conclusion: REVEL任务和DragStream方法为交互式视频编辑提供了新的解决方案，能够有效支持用户通过拖拽操作实现精细的视频内容控制。

Abstract: Achieving streaming, fine-grained control over the outputs of autoregressive
video diffusion models remains challenging, making it difficult to ensure that
they consistently align with user expectations. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{stReaming drag-oriEnted interactiVe vidEo manipuLation (REVEL)}, a new
task that enables users to modify generated videos \emph{anytime} on
\emph{anything} via fine-grained, interactive drag. Beyond DragVideo and
SG-I2V, REVEL unifies drag-style video manipulation as editing and animating
video frames with both supporting user-specified translation, deformation, and
rotation effects, making drag operations versatile. In resolving REVEL, we
observe: \emph{i}) drag-induced perturbations accumulate in latent space,
causing severe latent distribution drift that halts the drag process;
\emph{ii}) streaming drag is easily disturbed by context frames, thereby
yielding visually unnatural outcomes. We thus propose a training-free approach,
\textbf{DragStream}, comprising: \emph{i}) an adaptive distribution
self-rectification strategy that leverages neighboring frames' statistics to
effectively constrain the drift of latent embeddings; \emph{ii}) a
spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism, allowing the model to fully
exploit contextual information while mitigating its interference via
selectively propagating visual cues along generation. Our method can be
seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, and
extensive experiments firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our DragStream.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在计算病理学中提供了强大的特征提取器，但针对特定诊断任务进行适应和基准测试既耗时又资源密集。

Method: GAS-MIL是一个灵活的集成框架，无缝整合多个基础模型的特征，保留它们的互补优势。

Result: 在三种癌症数据集（前列腺、卵巢、乳腺癌）的分类任务中，GAS-MIL始终优于或与单个基础模型和现有MIL方法相当。

Conclusion: GAS-MIL通过有效整合异构基础模型，简化了病理学模型部署，为未来多模态和精准肿瘤学应用提供了可扩展基础。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed computational pathology by providing
powerful, general-purpose feature extractors. However, adapting and
benchmarking individual FMs for specific diagnostic tasks is often
time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially given their scale and
diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce Group-Aggregative Selection
Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL), a flexible ensemble framework that
seamlessly integrates features from multiple FMs, preserving their
complementary strengths without requiring manual feature selection or extensive
task-specific fine-tuning. Across classification tasks in three cancer
datasets-prostate (PANDA), ovarian (UBC-OCEAN), and breast (TCGA-BrCa)-GAS-MIL
consistently achieves superior or on-par performance relative to individual FMs
and established MIL methods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
By enabling efficient integration of heterogeneous FMs, GAS-MIL streamlines
model deployment for pathology and provides a scalable foundation for future
multimodal and precision oncology applications.

Motivation: 无人机快速递送纳洛酮为阿片类药物过量紧急情况提供了有前景的解决方案，但需要解决旁观者情境感知评估的关键研究空白，以支持人机协作团队的有效运作。

Method: 引入DANDSD数据集，提出基于图嵌入和Transformer模型的视频实时SA评估框架，整合几何、运动学和交互图特征等视觉感知和理解线索。

Conclusion: 这项工作支持开发能够有效指导旁观者的自适应无人机系统，最终改善紧急响应结果并拯救生命。

Abstract: Rapid naloxone delivery via drones offers a promising solution for responding
to opioid overdose emergencies (OOEs), by extending lifesaving interventions to
medically untrained bystanders before emergency medical services (EMS) arrive.
Recognizing the critical role of bystander situational awareness (SA) in
human-autonomy teaming (HAT), we address a key research gap in real-time SA
assessment by introducing the Drone-Assisted Naloxone Delivery Simulation
Dataset (DANDSD). This pioneering dataset captures HAT during simulated OOEs,
where college students without medical training act as bystanders tasked with
administering intranasal naloxone to a mock overdose victim. Leveraging this
dataset, we propose a video-based real-time SA assessment framework that
utilizes graph embeddings and transformer models to assess bystander SA in real
time. Our approach integrates visual perception and comprehension cues--such as
geometric, kinematic, and interaction graph features--and achieves
high-performance SA prediction. It also demonstrates strong temporal
segmentation accuracy, outperforming the FINCH baseline by 9% in Mean over
Frames (MoF) and 5% in Intersection over Union (IoU). This work supports the
development of adaptive drone systems capable of guiding bystanders
effectively, ultimately improving emergency response outcomes and saving lives.

TL;DR: 评估四种开源OCR系统（Tesseract、EasyOCR、PaddleOCR、TrOCR）在食品包装图像上的性能，重点关注成分表和营养信息提取的准确性和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品包装上的OCR对于合规性和营养监测很重要，但由于多语言文本、密集布局、字体变化、反光和曲面等挑战，准确提取信息具有难度。

Method: 使用231种产品（1,628张图像）的数据集，评估四种OCR模型的速度和覆盖率，并创建包含113张图像（60种产品）的真实标注子集进行准确性评估。

Result: Tesseract在真实标注子集上获得最低字符错误率（0.912）和最高BLEU分数（0.245）。EasyOCR在准确性和多语言支持之间取得良好平衡。PaddleOCR覆盖率接近完全但速度较慢，TrOCR表现最差。

Conclusion: 研究为包装OCR提供了特定基准，建立了基线，并指出了布局感知方法和文本定位的改进方向。

Abstract: This study evaluates four open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
systems which are Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and TrOCR on real world food
packaging images. The aim is to assess their ability to extract ingredient
lists and nutrition facts panels. Accurate OCR for packaging is important for
compliance and nutrition monitoring but is challenging due to multilingual
text, dense layouts, varied fonts, glare, and curved surfaces. A dataset of 231
products (1,628 images) was processed by all four models to assess speed and
coverage, and a ground truth subset of 113 images (60 products) was created for
accuracy evaluation. Metrics include Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error
Rate (WER), BLEU, ROUGE-L, F1, coverage, and execution time. On the ground
truth subset, Tesseract achieved the lowest CER (0.912) and the highest BLEU
(0.245). EasyOCR provided a good balance between accuracy and multilingual
support. PaddleOCR achieved near complete coverage but was slower because it
ran on CPU only due to GPU incompatibility, and TrOCR produced the weakest
results despite GPU acceleration. These results provide a packaging-specific
benchmark, establish a baseline, and highlight directions for layout-aware
methods and text localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有帧采样策略（如均匀采样或固定预算选择）无法适应信息密度和任务复杂度的变化，导致效率低下和信息损失。

Method: 提出FrameOracle模块，使用四阶段课程学习训练，前三阶段依赖跨模态相似度等弱代理信号，最后阶段利用新构建的FrameOracle-41K数据集提供的强监督关键帧标注。

Result: 在5个VLMs和6个基准测试中，FrameOracle将16帧输入平均减少到10.4帧而不损失准确性；从64帧候选帧中平均减少到13.9帧，同时准确率提升1.4%。

Conclusion: FrameOracle实现了可扩展视频理解中效率-准确性的最优权衡，在显著减少计算成本的同时保持或提升性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced video understanding, but their
performance is limited by the number of input frames they can process. Existing
frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, often
fail to adapt to variations in information density or task complexity,
resulting in inefficiency and information loss. To address this, we present
FrameOracle, a lightweight and plug-and-play module that predicts both (1)
which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are
needed. FrameOracle is trained using a four-stage curriculum, with the first
three stages relying on weak proxy signals such as cross-modal similarity. In
the final stage, it leverages stronger supervision from a new dataset we
introduce, FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA collection to provide
keyframe annotations specifying the minimal set of frames required to answer
each question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks
demonstrate that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4
frames without any loss in accuracy. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it
reduces the input to an average of 13.9 frames while improving accuracy by
1.4%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable
video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出混合协同微调(CFT)方法，结合标记和未标记数据来检测游戏视觉bug，减少对目标游戏标记数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏视觉bug的手动识别成本高且需要专业知识，而监督模型需要大量标记数据，但这类bug出现频率低，标记数据获取困难。

Method: 混合协同微调方法，利用目标游戏和同领域游戏的标记样本，结合未标记数据增强特征表示学习。

Result: 在多个游戏环境中表现优于传统基线方法，即使仅使用50%目标游戏标记数据仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: CFT方法提高了游戏视觉bug检测的可扩展性和适应性，有效减少了对特定目标游戏标记数据的依赖。

Abstract: Manual identification of visual bugs in video games is a resource-intensive
and costly process, often demanding specialized domain knowledge. While
supervised visual bug detection models offer a promising solution, their
reliance on extensive labeled datasets presents a significant challenge due to
the infrequent occurrence of such bugs. To overcome this limitation, we propose
a hybrid Co-FineTuning (CFT) method that effectively integrates both labeled
and unlabeled data. Our approach leverages labeled samples from the target game
and diverse co-domain games, additionally incorporating unlabeled data to
enhance feature representation learning. This strategy maximizes the utility of
all available data, substantially reducing the dependency on labeled examples
from the specific target game. The developed framework demonstrates enhanced
scalability and adaptability, facilitating efficient visual bug detection
across various game titles. Our experimental results show the robustness of the
proposed method for game visual bug detection, exhibiting superior performance
compared to conventional baselines across multiple gaming environments.
Furthermore, CFT maintains competitive performance even when trained with only
50% of the labeled data from the target game.

TL;DR: HRM模型在MNIST上表现良好（98%准确率），但在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上过拟合严重，性能远不如简单的CNN基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究Hierarchical Reasoning Model（HRM）是否可以作为实用的图像分类器，特别是在无数据增强的原始训练条件下。

Method: 使用包含两个Transformer模块的HRM架构，采用DEQ风格的一步训练、深度监督、Rotary位置编码和RMSNorm，在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上进行评估。

Result: HRM在MNIST上达到约98%测试准确率，但在CIFAR-10上只有65.0%（CNN基线77.2%），在CIFAR-100上仅29.7%（CNN基线45.3%），且训练速度比CNN慢约30倍。

Conclusion: 在无数据增强的小分辨率图像分类任务中，当前HRM架构不如简单的卷积网络，但通过模型改进可能有提升空间。

Abstract: This paper asks whether the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with the two
Transformer-style modules $(f_L,f_H)$, one step (DEQ-style) training, deep
supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm can serve as a practical
image classifier. It is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under a
deliberately raw regime: no data augmentation, identical optimizer family with
one-epoch warmup then cosine-floor decay, and label smoothing. HRM optimizes
stably and performs well on MNIST ($\approx 98\%$ test accuracy), but on small
natural images it overfits and generalizes poorly: on CIFAR-10, HRM reaches
65.0\% after 25 epochs, whereas a two-stage Conv--BN--ReLU baseline attains
77.2\% while training $\sim 30\times$ faster per epoch; on CIFAR-100, HRM
achieves only 29.7\% test accuracy despite 91.5\% train accuracy, while the
same CNN reaches 45.3\% test with 50.5\% train accuracy. Loss traces and error
analyses indicate healthy optimization but insufficient image-specific
inductive bias for HRM in this regime. It is concluded that, for
small-resolution image classification without augmentation, HRM is not
competitive with even simple convolutional architectures as the HRM currently
exist but this does not exclude possibilities that modifications to the model
may allow it to improve greatly.

Result: DINOv2在大多数基准测试中超越了弱监督方法如OpenCLIP，其学习特征展现出显著的涌现特性。

Conclusion: DINOv2虽然存在一些局限性，但对自监督学习领域产生了重要影响，为未来研究方向提供了启示。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have made it possible to
learn general-purpose visual features that capture both the high-level
semantics and the fine-grained spatial structure of images. Most notably, the
recent DINOv2 has established a new state of the art by surpassing weakly
supervised methods (WSL) like OpenCLIP on most benchmarks. In this survey, we
examine the core ideas behind its approach, multi-crop view augmentation and
self-distillation with a mean teacher, and trace their development in previous
work. We then compare the performance of DINO and DINOv2 with other SSL and WSL
methods across various downstream tasks, and highlight some remarkable emergent
properties of their learned features with transformer backbones. We conclude by
briefly discussing DINOv2's limitations, its impact, and future research
directions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DCS框架，通过扩散模型和分类器的协同进化解决小样本类增量学习中的数据稀缺问题，实现知识保持和新类学习的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FSCIL中由于数据稀缺导致的泛化能力不足问题，现有方法依赖有限数据集，而直接使用扩散模型进行数据增强会导致语义不对齐或引导无效。

Method: 采用扩散-分类器协同框架，基于分类器状态设计动态多层面奖励函数，在特征层面确保语义一致性和多样性，在logits层面促进探索性图像生成和类间区分度。

Result: 在FSCIL基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著增强了知识保持和新类学习能力。

Conclusion: DCS框架通过扩散模型和分类器的相互促进循环，有效解决了FSCIL中的数据稀缺和泛化挑战。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially
learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a
task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current
FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on
limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation,
their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective
guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel
framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and
FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a
dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state
directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the
feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored
maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits
level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class
discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session
confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated
images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better
reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL
benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class
learning.

Abstract: Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and
underground mining, are frequently caused by unsafe worker behaviors.
Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and
insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent
need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present
MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety
violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces
three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000
vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining
regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a
clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant
clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and
(3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve
fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in
precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM
significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving
improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score
over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further
integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation
reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of
multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and
beyond.

Abstract: The integration of Diffusion Models into Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) is a substantial improvement in the detection of accidents. We present a
novel hybrid model integrating guidance classification with diffusion
techniques. By leveraging fine-tuned ExceptionNet architecture outputs as input
for our proposed diffusion model and processing image tensors as our
conditioning, our approach creates a robust classification framework. Our model
consists of multiple conditional modules, which aim to modulate the linear
projection of inputs using time embeddings and image covariate embeddings,
allowing the network to adapt its behavior dynamically throughout the diffusion
process. To address the computationally intensive nature of diffusion models,
our implementation is cloud-based, enabling scalable and efficient processing.
Our strategy overcomes the shortcomings of conventional classification
approaches by leveraging diffusion models inherent capacity to effectively
understand complicated data distributions. We investigate important diffusion
characteristics, such as timestep schedulers, timestep encoding techniques,
timestep count, and architectural design changes, using a thorough ablation
study, and have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model
against the baseline models on a publicly available dataset. The proposed
diffusion model performs best in image-based accident detection with an
accuracy of 97.32%.

Conclusion: SAMSOD模型通过解决模态不平衡收敛和梯度差异问题，在RGB-T显著目标检测任务中表现出色，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: RGB-T salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment attractive objects by
combining RGB and thermal infrared images. To enhance performance, the Segment
Anything Model has been fine-tuned for this task. However, the imbalance
convergence of two modalities and significant gradient difference between high-
and low- activations are ignored, thereby leaving room for further performance
enhancement. In this paper, we propose a model called \textit{SAMSOD}, which
utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance the learning of non-dominant modality
and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting
gradients on model convergence. The method also leverages two decoupled
adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing
foreground objects by enhancing background learning. Fundamental experiments on
RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets and generalizability experiments on scribble
supervised RGB-T SOD, fully supervised RGB-D SOD datasets and full-supervised
RGB-D rail surface defect detection all demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.

parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enables models to progressively zoom in
and localize small objects. In a series of experiments, we apply PIZA to
GroundingDINO and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy on the
SOREC dataset. Our dataset, codes and pre-trained models are publicly available
on the project page.

Abstract: Segmenting of clinically important retinal blood vessels into arteries and
veins is a prerequisite for retinal vessel analysis. Such analysis can provide
potential insights and bio-markers for identifying and diagnosing various
retinal eye diseases. Alteration in the regularity and width of the retinal
blood vessels can act as an indicator of the health of the vasculature system
all over the body. It can help identify patients at high risk of developing
vasculature diseases like stroke and myocardial infarction. Over the years,
various Deep Learning architectures have been proposed to perform retinal
vessel segmentation. Recently, attention mechanisms have been increasingly used
in image segmentation tasks. The work proposes a new Deep Learning approach for
artery-vein segmentation. The new approach is based on the Attention mechanism
that is incorporated into the WNet Deep Learning model, and we call the model
as Attention-WNet. The proposed approach has been tested on publicly available
datasets such as HRF and DRIVE datasets. The proposed approach has outperformed
other state-of-art models available in the literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在大规模多模态数据集上训练显示出强烈的人口统计偏见，但训练数据在产生这些偏见中的作用尚不清楚，主要障碍是缺乏LAION-400M等网络规模数据集的人口统计标注。

Method: 通过验证的自动标注流水线为整个数据集创建以人为中心的标注，包括对象检测、多模态字幕生成和微调分类器的组合，生成超过2.76亿个边界框、感知性别和种族/民族标签以及自动生成的标题。

Result: 揭示了人口不平衡和有害关联，如男性和被感知为黑人或中东裔的个体与犯罪相关和负面内容的不成比例关联；证明CLIP和Stable Diffusion中60-70%的性别偏见可由数据中的直接共现线性解释。

Conclusion: 这些资源首次建立了数据集组成与下游模型偏见之间的大规模经验联系，为理解训练数据在模型偏见形成中的作用提供了实证基础。

Abstract: Vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets show strong
demographic biases, but the role of training data in producing these biases
remains unclear. A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations
in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating
person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million
bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically
generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic
labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and
finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and
harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and
individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and
negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable
Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our
resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset
composition and downstream model bias.

Abstract: While deep learning methods for detecting informal settlements have already
been developed, they have not yet fully utilized the potential offered by
recent pretrained neural networks. We compare two types of pretrained neural
networks for detecting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro: 1. Generic networks
pretrained on large diverse datasets of unspecific images, 2. A specialized
network pretrained on satellite imagery. While the latter is more specific to
the target task, the former has been pretrained on significantly more images.
Hence, this research investigates whether task specificity or data volume
yields superior performance in urban informal settlement detection.

Motivation: 当前针对Deepfake的主动防御方法缺乏鲁棒性和可靠性，需要揭示这些防御的弱点并开发更强大的防御策略。

Method: 使用低秩适应(LoRA)补丁技术，结合可学习的门控机制防止梯度爆炸，并引入多模态特征对齐(MMFA)损失函数在语义层面对齐特征。

Conclusion: 当前Deepfake防御策略存在严重漏洞，需要开发更鲁棒的防御方法，同时提出的防御性LoRA补丁可作为补充解决方案。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant societal risks, motivating the development of
proactive defenses that embed adversarial perturbations in facial images to
prevent manipulation. However, in this paper, we show that these preemptive
defenses often lack robustness and reliability. We propose a novel approach,
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching, which injects a plug-and-play LoRA patch
into Deepfake generators to bypass state-of-the-art defenses. A learnable
gating mechanism adaptively controls the effect of the LoRA patch and prevents
gradient explosions during fine-tuning. We also introduce a Multi-Modal Feature
Alignment (MMFA) loss, encouraging the features of adversarial outputs to align
with those of the desired outputs at the semantic level. Beyond bypassing, we
present defensive LoRA patching, embedding visible warnings in the outputs as a
complementary solution to mitigate this newly identified security
vulnerability. With only 1,000 facial examples and a single epoch of
fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses.
These results reveal a critical weakness in current paradigms and underscore
the need for more robust Deepfake defense strategies. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 参考集微调是一种有效的方法，能够利用测试时参考集中的目标域信息显著提升VPR模型在具有显著域差距的挑战性数据集上的性能。

Abstract: Given a query image, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is the task of retrieving
an image of the same place from a reference database with robustness to
viewpoint and appearance changes. Recent works show that some VPR benchmarks
are solved by methods using Vision-Foundation-Model backbones and trained on
large-scale and diverse VPR-specific datasets. Several benchmarks remain
challenging, particularly when the test environments differ significantly from
the usual VPR training datasets. We propose a complementary, unexplored source
of information to bridge the train-test domain gap, which can further improve
the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) VPR methods on such challenging
benchmarks. Concretely, we identify that the test-time reference set, the
"map", contains images and poses of the target domain, and must be available
before the test-time query is received in several VPR applications. Therefore,
we propose to perform simple Reference-Set-Finetuning (RSF) of VPR models on
the map, boosting the SOTA (~2.3% increase on average for Recall@1) on these
challenging datasets. Finetuned models retain generalization, and RSF works
across diverse test datasets.

TL;DR: ARSAM通过自适应采样-重用-混合分解梯度来加速SAM，在保持模型泛化能力的同时提供约40%的速度提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM虽然能提升模型泛化能力，但计算成本是SGD的两倍，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 将SAM梯度分解为SGD梯度和二阶梯度在一阶梯度上的投影(PSF)，并自适应地重用PSF和及时更新PSF

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100等数据集上达到与SAM相当的准确率，速度提升约40%，并在人体姿态估计、模型量化等挑战任务中有效加速

Conclusion: ARSAM在保持SAM泛化优势的同时显著降低计算成本，具有广泛的实用性

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization but doubles
the computational cost of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by requiring twice
the gradient calculations per optimization step. To mitigate this, we propose
Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients to significantly
accelerate SAM (ARSAM). Concretely, we firstly discover that SAM's gradient can
be decomposed into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order
gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). Furthermore, we observe that the
SGD gradient and PSF dynamically evolve during training, emphasizing the
growing role of the PSF to achieve a flat minima. Therefore, ARSAM is proposed
to the reused PSF and the timely updated PSF still maintain the model's
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ARSAM achieves
state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM across diverse network
architectures. On CIFAR-10/100, ARSAM is comparable to SAM while providing a
speedup of about 40\%. Moreover, ARSAM accelerates optimization for the various
challenge tasks (\textit{e.g.}, human pose estimation, and model quantization)
without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.% The

Abstract: The transparency of deep learning models is essential for clinical
diagnostics. Concept Bottleneck Model provides clear decision-making processes
for diagnosis by transforming the latent space of black-box models into
human-understandable concepts. However, concept-based methods still face
challenges in concept capture capabilities. These methods often rely on encode
features solely from the final layer, neglecting shallow and multiscale
features, and lack effective guidance in concept encoding, hindering
fine-grained concept extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Concept
Prompting and Aggregating (CoPA), a novel framework designed to capture
multilayer concepts under prompt guidance. This framework utilizes the
Concept-aware Embedding Generator (CEG) to extract concept representations from
each layer of the visual encoder. Simultaneously, these representations serve
as prompts for Concept Prompt Tuning (CPT), steering the model towards
amplifying critical concept-related visual cues. Visual representations from
each layer are aggregated to align with textual concept representations. With
the proposed method, valuable concept-wise information in the images is
captured and utilized effectively, thus improving the performance of concept
and disease prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CoPA
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets. Code is

Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of medical imaging datasets, particularly
in 3D formats, present significant barriers to collaborative research and
transferability. This study investigates whether the ZFP compression technique
can mitigate these challenges without compromising the performance of automated
cerebrovascular segmentation, a critical first step in intracranial aneurysm
detection. We apply ZFP in both its error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a
large scale, and one of the most recent, datasets in the literature, 3D medical
dataset containing ground-truth vascular segmentations. The segmentation
quality on the compressed volumes is rigorously compared to the uncompressed
baseline (Dice approximately equals 0.8774). Our findings reveal that ZFP can
achieve substantial data reduction--up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance
mode--while maintaining a high degree of fidelity, with the mean Dice
coefficient remaining high at 0.87656. These results demonstrate that ZFP is a

segmenting complex medical tissues and tumors. However, existing models are
often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical
regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging,
particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are
critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation
architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs,
Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture
local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN
decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual
consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by
emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both
encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale
communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and
generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By
effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a
practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code
and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support
reproducibility and further research.

Motivation: 手动监测道路损坏耗时、成本高且容易出错，需要为发展中国家提供高效可扩展的城市基础设施监控解决方案。

Method: 采用YOLOv9算法，使用多边形标注替代传统边界框标注以获得更精确的定位，构建包含1000多张图像的数据集，训练三个类别（损坏、未损坏、井盖）的检测模型。

Result: 整体图像级准确率为78.1%，损坏类F1分数86.7%，未损坏类89.2%，井盖类因类别不平衡问题仅18.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法为发展中国家城市基础设施监控提供了高效可扩展的解决方案，多边形标注提高了定位精度，但井盖检测仍需改进。

Abstract: Urban safety and infrastructure maintenance are critical components of smart
city development. Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly
costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for
automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with
polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ
polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop
a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly
collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based
model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve
78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong
performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score)
classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class
imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for
monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对比学习和扩散模型的非配对图像转换方法，通过时间相关的对比学习保留领域不变特征，用预训练的SDE进行图像转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非配对图像转换需要学习源域和目标域之间的映射，但缺乏对齐样本。扩散模型能生成高质量多样化输出，对比学习能学习语义相似性，两者结合适合非配对场景。

Method: 使用时间相关的对比学习方法，将图像及其领域不变特征作为正样本对进行SimCLR训练，然后用学习到的对比模型指导预训练SDE进行图像转换。

Result: 在三个常见非配对图像转换任务上与多个基线方法比较，使用四个评估指标。Contrastive-SDE在多个指标上达到与最先进方法相当的结果，收敛速度显著更快，且无需标签监督或分类器训练。

Conclusion: 该方法为非配对图像转换提供了更高效的替代方案，结合了扩散模型和对比学习的优势，在保持性能的同时提高了训练效率。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation involves learning mappings between source
domain and target domain in the absence of aligned or corresponding samples.
Score based diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
generative tasks. Their ability to approximate complex data distributions
through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) enables them to generate
high-fidelity and diverse outputs, making them particularly well-suited for
unpaired I2I settings. In parallel, contrastive learning provides a powerful
framework for learning semantic similarities without the need for explicit
supervision or paired data. By pulling together representations of semantically
similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, contrastive methods are
inherently aligned with the objectives of unpaired translation. Its ability to
selectively enforce semantic consistency at the feature level makes contrastive
learning particularly effective for guiding generation in unpaired scenarios.
In this work, we propose a time-dependent contrastive learning approach where a
model is trained with SimCLR by considering an image and its domain invarient
feature as a positive pair, enabling the preservation of domain-invariant
features and the discarding of domain-specific ones. The learned contrastive
model then guides the inference of a pretrained SDE for the I2I translation
task. We empirically compare Contrastive-SDE with several baselines across
three common unpaired I2I tasks, using four metrics for evaluation.
Constrastive-SDE achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art on several
metrics. Furthermore, we observe that our model converges significantly faster
and requires no label supervision or classifier training, making it a more
efficient alternative for this task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIBERO-PRO扩展了LIBERO基准测试，系统评估模型在四个维度扰动下的性能，发现现有模型在标准测试中表现优秀但在广义设置下性能崩溃至0%，揭示了模型依赖训练集记忆而非真正理解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LIBERO基准测试的训练和评估设置存在问题，导致性能估计被夸大且无法公平比较模型。需要更严格的评估方法来测试模型的泛化能力和真实理解水平。

Method: 引入LIBERO-PRO基准，在四个维度上系统应用扰动：操作对象、初始状态、任务指令和环境设置，评估模型在广义场景下的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有模型在标准LIBERO评估中准确率超过90%，但在广义设置下性能崩溃至0.0%。模型表现出对训练集动作序列和环境布局的机械记忆，而非真正的任务理解。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法存在严重缺陷，呼吁社区放弃误导性方法，采用更稳健的评估来测试模型的泛化能力和理解水平。

Abstract: LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and
evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance
estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we
introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically
evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four
dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and
environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models
achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their
performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this
discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action
sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine
task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in
executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant
items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted
instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in
current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon
misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization
and comprehension. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 当前AI生成图像越来越难以被标准检测器识别，但人类仍能区分。需要研究更有效的检测方法。

Method: 构建Mirage数据集，包含具有可见伪影的AI生成图像，并评估大型视觉语言模型在这些图像上的检测性能。

Result: 大型视觉语言模型在具有可见伪影的AI生成图像上检测效果很好，但在缺乏此类线索的图像上性能下降。

Conclusion: 大型视觉语言模型可用于可解释的AI图像检测，特别是在存在可见伪影的情况下，但对高质量生成图像的检测仍需改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models have led to models that produce
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult for standard AI detectors to
identify, even though they often remain distinguishable by humans. To identify
this discrepancy, we introduce \textbf{Mirage}, a curated dataset comprising a
diverse range of AI-generated images exhibiting visible artifacts, where
current state-of-the-art detection methods largely fail. Furthermore, we
investigate whether Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are
increasingly employed as substitutes for human judgment in various tasks, can
be leveraged for explainable AI image detection. Our experiments on both Mirage
and existing benchmark datasets demonstrate that while LVLMs are highly
effective at detecting AI-generated images with visible artifacts, their
performance declines when confronted with images lacking such cues.

*Rui Qian,Xin Yin,Chuanhang Deng,Zhiyuan Peng,Jian Xiong,Wei Zhai,Dejing Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UGround提出了一种统一的视觉定位范式，通过动态选择Transformer中间层作为"掩码提示"，解决了传统方法依赖固定最后一层和<SEG>作为提示的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉定位方法存在两个主要问题：1) 依赖固定的最后一层隐藏层，导致层间传播误差累积；2) 使用<SEG>作为提示，缺乏明确的空间线索。

Method: 提出Policy-Prompted Masking方法，包含随机跳跃连接(SSC)和掩码作为提示(MasP)。SSC通过强化学习策略动态选择连接层，MasP使用相似度图作为软逻辑掩码来提示SAM生成掩码。

Result: UGround首次在单一框架内统一了从传统参考表达分割到推理分割、从单目标到多目标、从正查询到错误前提的视觉定位任务。

Conclusion: UGround通过动态层选择和明确的空间线索，有效提升了视觉定位的性能和鲁棒性，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: We present UGround, a \textbf{U}nified visual \textbf{Ground}ing paradigm
that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \textbf{U}nrolled
transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that
leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\texttt{<SEG>} as prompt''. UGround
addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its
reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies
cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate
correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly
projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues
(\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which
comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as
Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic
sampling, allows each \texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer
layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision
model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer,
MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{<SEG>} token and image
tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering
explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the
effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding
within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from
traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning
segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise
(empty target). All codes and models are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D高斯溅射虽然能实时渲染复杂动态场景，但需要数百万个高斯函数，存储开销巨大。现有压缩方法在压缩比或视觉质量方面仍有局限。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进式修剪：高斯采样识别关键基元、高斯修剪去除冗余、高斯合并融合相似基元。结合隐式外观压缩和广义子向量量化技术。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上的实验表明，OMG4显著优于现有方法，模型大小减少超过60%的同时保持重建质量。

Conclusion: OMG4在紧凑4D场景表示方面迈出了重要一步，为广泛应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene
representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions.
However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of
Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies
have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in
compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized
Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of
salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our
method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to
identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning
to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with
similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance
compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations,
further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms
recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while
maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a
significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new
possibilities for a wide range of applications. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 传统目标检测模型在固定类别集上训练，缺乏灵活性且扩展成本高。开放词汇目标检测能够识别未见过类别，但航拍图像与地面视图存在域偏移、视角变化和尺度差异，需要专门的适配策略。

Method: 采用对比图像到图像对齐增强航拍与地面视图嵌入的相似性，并使用多实例词汇关联将航拍图像与文本嵌入对齐，实现结构化域对齐。

Result: 在xView、DOTAv2、VisDrone、DIOR和HRRSD数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。在零样本设置下，相比微调的封闭词汇模型，在DOTAv2上提升+6.32 mAP，VisDrone上+4.16 mAP，HRRSD上+3.46 mAP。

Conclusion: 该方法为航拍应用中的目标检测系统提供了更灵活和可扩展的解决方案，通过有效的跨域知识迁移实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Traditional object detection models are typically trained on a fixed set of
classes, limiting their flexibility and making it costly to incorporate new
categories. Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by
enabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training.
Leveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available
ground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for
open-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint
variations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across
domains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for adapting open-vocabulary
representations from ground-view images to solve object detection in aerial
imagery through structured domain alignment. The method introduces contrastive
image-to-image alignment to enhance the similarity between aerial and
ground-view embeddings and employs multi-instance vocabulary associations to
align aerial images with text embeddings. Extensive experiments on the xView,
DOTAv2, VisDrone, DIOR, and HRRSD datasets are used to validate our approach.
Our open-vocabulary model achieves improvements of +6.32 mAP on DOTAv2, +4.16
mAP on VisDrone (Images), and +3.46 mAP on HRRSD in the zero-shot setting when
compared to finetuned closed-vocabulary dataset-specific model performance,
thus paving the way for more flexible and scalable object detection systems in
aerial applications.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) achieve excellent performance in
generative tasks, such as image super-resolution, but their computational
requirements make difficult their deployment on resource-constrained devices.
While knowledge distillation is a promising research direction for GAN
compression, effectively training a smaller student generator is challenging
due to the capacity mismatch between the student generator and the teacher
discriminator. In this work, we propose Student Discriminator Assisted
Knowledge Distillation (SDAKD), a novel GAN distillation methodology that
introduces a student discriminator to mitigate this capacity mismatch. SDAKD
follows a three-stage training strategy, and integrates an adapted feature map
distillation approach in its last two training stages. We evaluated SDAKD on
two well-performing super-resolution GANs, GCFSR and Real-ESRGAN. Our
experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over the baselines and SOTA GAN
knowledge distillation methods. The SDAKD source code will be made openly
available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Diagnosing ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) requires a
comprehensive analysis of both head pose and ocular movements. However,
existing datasets focus on these aspects separately, limiting the development
of integrated diagnostic approaches and restricting AI-driven advancements in
AHP analysis. To address this gap, we introduce PoseGaze-AHP, a novel 3D

ocular-induced AHP assessment. Structured clinical data were extracted from
medical literature using large language models (LLMs) through an iterative
process with the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, combining stepwise, hierarchical, and
complex prompting strategies. The extracted records were systematically imputed
and transformed into 3D representations using the Neural Head Avatar (NHA)
framework. The dataset includes 7,920 images generated from two head textures,
covering a broad spectrum of ocular conditions. The extraction method achieved
an overall accuracy of 91.92%, demonstrating its reliability for clinical
dataset construction. PoseGaze-AHP is the first publicly available resource
tailored for AI-driven ocular-induced AHP diagnosis, supporting the development
of accurate and privacy-compliant diagnostic tools.

Abstract: With the rapid development of 3D scanning and reconstruction technologies,
dynamic digital human avatars based on 4D meshes have become increasingly
popular. A high-precision dynamic digital human avatar can be applied to
various fields such as game production, animation generation, and remote
immersive communication. However, these 4D human avatar meshes are prone to
being degraded by various types of noise during the processes of collection,
compression, and transmission, thereby affecting the viewing experience of
users. In light of this fact, quality assessment of dynamic 4D digital humans
becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we first propose a large-scale
dynamic digital human quality assessment dataset, DHQA-4D, which contains 32
high-quality real-scanned 4D human mesh sequences, 1920 distorted textured 4D
human meshes degraded by 11 textured distortions, as well as their
corresponding textured and non-textured mean opinion scores (MOSs). Equipped
with DHQA-4D dataset, we analyze the influence of different types of distortion
on human perception for textured dynamic 4D meshes and non-textured dynamic 4D
meshes. Additionally, we propose DynaMesh-Rater, a novel large multimodal model
(LMM) based approach that is able to assess both textured 4D meshes and
non-textured 4D meshes. Concretely, DynaMesh-Rater elaborately extracts
multi-dimensional features, including visual features from a projected 2D
video, motion features from cropped video clips, and geometry features from the
4D human mesh to provide comprehensive quality-related information. Then we
utilize a LMM model to integrate the multi-dimensional features and conduct a
LoRA-based instruction tuning technique to teach the LMM model to predict the
quality scores. Extensive experimental results on the DHQA-4D dataset
demonstrate the superiority of our DynaMesh-Rater method over previous quality
assessment methods.

Abstract: Skin cancer classification remains a challenging problem due to high
inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and image noise in dermoscopic
images. To address these issues, we propose an improved ResNet-50 model
enhanced with Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF), which adaptively
integrates multi-scale semantic and surface features to improve feature
representation and reduce overfitting. The ResNet-50 model is enhanced with an
adaptive feature fusion mechanism to achieve more effective multi-scale feature
extraction and improve overall performance. Specifically, a dual-branch design
fuses high-level semantic and mid-level detail features, which are processed
through global average pooling and fully connected layers to generate adaptive
weights for weighted fusion, thereby strengthening feature learning and
reducing the impact of noise on classification. The method is evaluated on a
subset of the ISIC 2020 dataset containing 3297 benign and malignant skin
lesion images. Experimental results show that the proposed ASFF-based ResNet-50
achieves the best overall performance compared with 5 classic convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) models. The proposed model reached an accuracy of 93.18%
along with higher precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. The improved
model achieves an AUC value of 0.9670 and 0.9717 in the P-R and ROC curve,
respectively. Then, the evaluation based on Grad-CAM further proved that the
improved model adaptively focuses on lesion-relevant regions while suppressing
irrelevant background information, thereby validating its enhanced feature
learning capability from a deep representation perspective. These findings
demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a more effective and efficient
solution for computer-aided skin cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Aims Late diagnosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) contributes
significantly to its high global mortality rate, with over 50\% of cases
detected at advanced stages and a 5-year survival rate below 50\% according to
WHO statistics. This study aims to improve early detection of OSCC by
developing a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates clinical,
radiological, and histopathological images using a weighted ensemble of
DenseNet-121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Material and Methods A
retrospective study was conducted using publicly available datasets
representing three distinct medical imaging modalities. Each modality-specific
dataset was used to train a DenseNet-121 CNN via transfer learning.
Augmentation and modality-specific preprocessing were applied to increase
robustness. Predictions were fused using a validation-weighted ensemble
strategy. Evaluation was performed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Results High validation accuracy was achieved for radiological (100\%) and
histopathological (95.12\%) modalities, with clinical images performing lower
(63.10\%) due to visual heterogeneity. The ensemble model demonstrated improved
diagnostic robustness with an overall accuracy of 84.58\% on a multimodal
validation dataset of 55 samples. Conclusion The multimodal ensemble framework
bridges gaps in the current diagnostic workflow by offering a non-invasive,
AI-assisted triage tool that enhances early identification of high-risk
lesions. It supports clinicians in decision-making, aligning with global
oncology guidelines to reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了扩展定律，提出了一种基于聚类的数据选择方法IQA-Select，仅使用10%的数据就能在可解释图像质量评估任务上达到甚至超过全量微调的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释图像质量评估方法依赖大规模指令调优数据集，但这会导致高计算成本和数据冗余问题，反而可能损害模型性能。

Method: 提出三阶段聚类数据选择框架：聚类特征提取、聚类配额分配、聚类采样策略，并开发了IQA-Select方法。

Result: 在Q-Bench和AesBench数据集上，仅使用10%选择的数据分别达到全量微调性能的102.1%和103.7%，显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 数据质量比数据量更重要，IQA-Select方法能有效减少冗余数据，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算开销。

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), explainable image quality assessment (IQA) has
gradually become popular, aiming at providing quality-related descriptions and
answers of images. To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a
large-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality
perception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large
amount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and
redundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model.
To cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and
systematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning
dataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first
investigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different
sizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data
set randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than
training with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the
redundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data. Beyond randomly
sampling a subset, we propose a clustering-based data selection framework with
three stages: clustering feature extraction, cluster quota allocation, and
cluster sampling strategy. Then we systematically analyze the choices of each
stage and propose a simple but efficient data selection method IQA-Select for
explainable IQA. The experimental results demonstrate that IQA-Select can
achieve 102.1% and 103.7% performance of full fine-tuning using only 10%
selected data in Q-Bench and AesBench respectively, significantly reducing
computational costs while achieving better performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于通用化动作专家的框架，使用稀疏3D轨迹作为中间表示，将VLM的高层规划能力与低层物理动作模块连接起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLA模型泛化能力差，双系统方法存在语义模糊问题，需要在新环境中重新微调，且两个系统的协作机制不明确。

Method: 使用稀疏3D路径点作为中间表示，VLM生成粗略路径点，通用动作专家通过采样实时点云观测将其细化为密集可执行动作序列，采用"动作预训练、点云微调"范式。

Result: 结合了VLM在视觉理解和规划方面的广泛泛化能力与动作专家在动作级别的细粒度泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了VLA模型在物理世界中的泛化问题，通过中间表示和专门的动作专家实现了更好的跨任务训练和环境适应性。

Abstract: Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning
and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world
introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture,
generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data.
While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from
"acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action
module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible.
Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly
collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation
mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these
limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a
generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an
intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning
capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the
planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These
waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines
them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud
observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust
generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud
Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization
capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the
fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on vision-language reasoning tasks. However, their potential for zero-shot
fine-grained image classification, a challenging task requiring precise
differentiation between visually similar categories, remains underexplored. We
present a novel method that transforms zero-shot fine-grained image
classification into a visual question-answering framework, leveraging LVLMs'
comprehensive understanding capabilities rather than relying on direct class
name generation. We enhance model performance through a novel attention
intervention technique. We also address a key limitation in existing datasets
by developing more comprehensive and precise class description benchmarks. We
validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimentation
across multiple fine-grained image classification benchmarks. Our proposed
method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach,

TL;DR: 本文对自动驾驶感知系统在雾天条件下的去雾方法进行了系统性实证研究，评估了多种去雾方法对下游目标检测和分割任务的实际影响。


<details>

Motivation: 自动驾驶感知系统在雾天条件下特别脆弱，现有去雾方法在图像保真度上的改进并不总是能转化为更好的下游检测和分割性能，且先前评估多依赖合成数据，对真实世界适用性存在疑问。

Method: 使用Foggy Cityscapes数据集，系统评估了经典滤波器、现代去雾网络、链式变体（滤波器→模型、模型→滤波器）以及基于提示的视觉-语言图像编辑模型等多种去雾流水线。

Result: 分析揭示了去雾何时有效、链式方法何时产生协同效应或退化，以及VLM编辑器与专用方法的比较。VLM评判的定性评分与任务指标（特别是mAP）显示出强相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为去雾方法建立了透明、任务导向的基准，并明确了在何种条件下预处理能真正改善自动驾驶在恶劣天气下的感知性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy
conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details
critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from
handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image
fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and
segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving
questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical
study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical
filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants
(filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven
visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images.
Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance
on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals
when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how
VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate
qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment
with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these
results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods
and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves
autonomous perception in adverse weather.

Motivation: 尽管视频扩散模型快速发展，但在通用人体视频生成方面仍未被充分探索，大多数工作局限于图像到视频设置或舞蹈视频等狭窄领域。

Method: 提出CAMEO分层框架，分析并准备文本提示和视觉条件来有效训练视频扩散模型，确保运动描述、条件信号和生成视频之间的稳健对齐，并引入相机感知条件模块连接两个阶段。

Result: 在MovieGen基准和新引入的T2M-VDM组合基准上证明了方法的有效性，并展示了其在不同用例中的多功能性。

Conclusion: CAMEO框架成功解决了通用人体运动视频生成的挑战，通过精心设计的组件实现了文本到运动模型和条件视频扩散模型的无缝桥接。

Abstract: Human video generation is becoming an increasingly important task with broad
applications in graphics, entertainment, and embodied AI. Despite the rapid
progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human
video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to
image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we
propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation.
It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs,
mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both
training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we
analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively
train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions,
conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a
camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically
selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and
reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the
T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use
cases.

Motivation: 集中式VPS无法覆盖私有室内空间，存在隐私担忧、监管限制和维护瓶颈。需要分布式解决方案来扩大覆盖范围并保护隐私。

Method: 采用联邦图像定位概念，各组织独立维护VPS服务，通过参考解决方案管理和合并跨地图数据而不共享私有数据。

Result: 实现了分布式VPS后端，支持访问控制、分布式维护和更大覆盖范围。

Conclusion: 联邦VPS架构能够解决集中式系统的局限性，为大规模AR应用提供可行的定位后端解决方案。

Abstract: World-scale augmented reality (AR) applications need a ubiquitous 6DoF
localization backend to anchor content to the real world consistently across
devices. Large organizations such as Google and Niantic are 3D scanning outdoor
public spaces in order to build their own Visual Positioning Systems (VPS).
These centralized VPS solutions fail to meet the needs of many future AR
applications -- they do not cover private indoor spaces because of privacy
concerns, regulations, and the labor bottleneck of updating and maintaining 3D
scans. In this paper, we present OpenFLAME, a federated VPS backend that allows
independent organizations to 3D scan and maintain a separate VPS service for
their own spaces. This enables access control of indoor 3D scans, distributed
maintenance of the VPS backend, and encourages larger coverage. Sharding of VPS
services introduces several unique challenges -- coherency of localization
results across spaces, quality control of VPS services, selection of the right
VPS service for a location, and many others. We introduce the concept of
federated image-based localization and provide reference solutions for managing
and merging data across maps without sharing private data.

Abstract: Automated tennis stroke analysis has advanced significantly with the
integration of biomechanical motion cues alongside deep learning techniques,
enhancing stroke classification accuracy and player performance evaluation.
Despite these advancements, existing systems often fail to connect
biomechanical insights with actionable language feedback that is both
accessible and meaningful to players and coaches. This research project
addresses this gap by developing a novel framework that extracts key
biomechanical features (such as joint angles, limb velocities, and kinetic
chain patterns) from motion data using Convolutional Neural Network Long
Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM)-based models. These features are analyzed for
relationships influencing stroke effectiveness and injury risk, forming the
basis for feedback generation using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging
the THETIS dataset and feature extraction techniques, our approach aims to
produce feedback that is technically accurate, biomechanically grounded, and
actionable for end-users. The experimental setup evaluates this framework on
classification performance and interpretability, bridging the gap between
explainable AI and sports biomechanics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型在需要细粒度时序理解的任务上表现不佳，主要原因是微调数据集缺乏视觉复杂性和时序细节，导致模型过度依赖语言推理而非真正理解视频动态。

Method: 提出TimeWarp方法，系统性地创建目标合成时序数据集来微调模型，使其更关注输入视频内容。构建了一个大规模偏好数据集，捕捉常被忽视的复杂时序动态，将模型响应基于视觉和时序信息。

Conclusion: TimeWarp方法通过针对性数据集有效提升了视频大语言模型的时序理解能力，证明了所提数据集在推进视频时序理解方面的有效性。

Abstract: While Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across general video understanding benchmarks-particularly in video
captioning and descriptive tasks-they consistently underperform on tasks that
require fine-grained temporal understanding. This limitation arises due to the
lack of visual complexity and temporal nuance in current fine-tuning datasets,
leading these models to rely heavily on language-based reasoning rather than
truly understanding video dynamics. In this work, we propose TimeWarp, a
systematic method to create a targeted synthetic temporal dataset to fine-tune
the model's responses to encourage it to focus on the given input video. We
introduce a large-scale preference dataset, created using TimeWarp, that
captures intricate temporal dynamics often overlooked, grounding the model's
responses to visual and temporal information. We demonstrate that when our
method is applied to existing models, it significantly improves performance on
temporal understanding benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our
proposed datasets in advancing temporal understanding in Video-LLMs, resulting
in an absolute improvement in performance across seven benchmarks. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型通常使用短文本窗口（<77个token）进行预训练，这导致长格式生物医学标注被截断。然而，大规模开源文献显示大部分生物医学标注远超77个token，因此需要研究长上下文对模型性能的影响。

Method: 通过扩展视觉语言模型中文本编码器的上下文长度，使用BIOMEDICA-LongCAP数据集（包含100万图像-标注对，具有来自全文文章的情境感知描述）训练BMC-LongCLIP模型，支持最多512个token的文本窗口。

Result: BMC-LongCLIP将上下文容量扩展6.6倍，token浪费率从55%降至2.2%。在长标注检索基准测试中，Recall@1获得高达30%的绝对增益，分类平均提升2%，且收敛速度比短上下文模型更快。

Conclusion: 长上下文建模是推进生物医学视觉语言模型发展的有前景方向，长格式标注提供的额外监督能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short
text windows (<77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions.
Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source
literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To
this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical
captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that
longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format
captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance.
Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M
image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text
articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using
BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a
text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context
capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption
retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in
Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging
faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling
is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.

Conclusion: CPG框架能有效处理未知未标记数据分布，通过可控伪标签生成显著降低泛化误差，提升长尾半监督学习性能。

Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data
exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical
predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed).
However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may
follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled
dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the
unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a
known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution.
Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization
cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism
selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into
the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known
distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit
adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved
classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next
training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can
significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions.
Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further
improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to
maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples.
Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that
CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up
to \textbf{15.97\%} in accuracy. The code is available at

Abstract: Recognizing and processing Classical Chinese (Han-Nom) texts play a vital
role in digitizing Vietnamese historical documents and enabling cross-lingual

base model, with exact accuracy increasing from 37.5 percent to 50.0 percent,
particularly under noisy image conditions. Furthermore, we develop an
interactive demo that visually compares pre- and post-fine-tuning recognition
results, facilitating downstream applications such as Han-Vietnamese semantic

Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INRs)在信号表示方面表现出色，但不适用于需要学习语义结构的预测任务如分割。

Method: 使用底层INR同时预测像素强度和类别标签，通过元学习找到最优初始参数，使INR能够快速微调适应新图像并自动解码类别标签。

Conclusion: MetaSeg为医学图像分割提供了一个新颖、可扩展的替代方案，相比传统的U-Net和视觉变换器架构更轻量。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have achieved remarkable successes in
learning expressive yet compact signal representations. However, they are not
naturally amenable to predictive tasks such as segmentation, where they must
learn semantic structures over a distribution of signals. In this study, we
introduce MetaSeg, a meta-learning framework to train INRs for medical image
segmentation. MetaSeg uses an underlying INR that simultaneously predicts per
pixel intensity values and class labels. It then uses a meta-learning procedure
to find optimal initial parameters for this INR over a training dataset of
images and segmentation maps, such that the INR can simply be fine-tuned to fit
pixels of an unseen test image, and automatically decode its class labels. We
evaluated MetaSeg on 2D and 3D brain MRI segmentation tasks and report Dice
scores comparable to commonly used U-Net models, but with $90\%$ fewer
parameters. MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional
resource-heavy architectures such as U-Nets and vision transformers for medical
image segmentation. Our project is available at

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用低帧率浏览定位问题相关时间区间；2) 在高帧率下进行span感知的token重新分配来回答问题；采用端到端训练，结合时间IoU和答案正确性的联合目标。

Result: 在固定token预算下，ViTL在长视频问答和时间定位任务上（如Charades-STA、ActivityNet-Captions）性能提升达8.6%，同时减少50%的帧输入；span感知的token重新分配始终优于均匀采样。

Conclusion: ViTL和配套数据集提供了一个可解释、计算高效的解决方案，为可扩展的长视频问答提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We present \emph{Video-in-the-Loop} (ViTL), a two-stage long-video QA
framework that preserves a fixed token budget by first \emph{localizing}
question-relevant interval(s) with a low-fps skim and then \emph{answering} via
span-aware reallocation of visual tokens at higher effective frame rate,
emitting an interleaved output with both spans and the final option for direct
attribution. We also introduce \dataname{}, which converts description based
event graphs into \emph{span-grounded} multiple-choice QA by pairing each
question with \emph{ground-truth} time span(s) and related reasoning. ViTL is
trained end-to-end with an interleaved group-relative objective that couples
temporal IoU for localization with answer correctness, allowing credit to flow
from answers back to spans without increasing compute. Under fixed token
budgets, ViTL attains up to 8.6% with 50% less frame input on long-video QA and
temporal grounding (e.g., Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions) and ablations
show that span-aware token reallocation consistently surpasses uniform
sampling. Together, \dataname{} and ViTL provide an interpretable,
compute-efficient recipe for scalable long-video QA.

TL;DR: 该研究通过探索和优化超参数，提高了基于提示到提示的图像编辑框架的精确性和可靠性，提出了三种方法来解决现有问题。


<details>

Motivation: 当前基于稳定扩散模型的图像编辑方法虽然简化了编辑过程，但结果存在变异性（如发色变化不一致），需要提高编辑的精确性和可靠性。

Method: 1. 全面研究"词语替换"方法；2. 开发"注意力重加权方法"以提高适应性；3. 提出"CL P2P"框架解决循环不一致等现有限制。

Result: 研究有助于理解超参数设置与神经网络模型架构选择（特别是注意力机制）之间的相互作用，这些因素显著影响生成图像的构图和质量。

Conclusion: 通过优化超参数和改进注意力机制，可以显著提升文本驱动图像编辑的精度和可靠性，为图像编辑技术的发展提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing have shifted from manual pixel manipulation
to employing deep learning methods like stable diffusion models, which now
leverage cross-attention mechanisms for text-driven control. This transition
has simplified the editing process but also introduced variability in results,
such as inconsistent hair color changes. Our research aims to enhance the
precision and reliability of prompt-to-prompt image editing frameworks by
exploring and optimizing hyperparameters. We present a comprehensive study of
the "word swap" method, develop an "attention re-weight method" for better
adaptability, and propose the "CL P2P" framework to address existing
limitations like cycle inconsistency. This work contributes to understanding
and improving the interaction between hyperparameter settings and the
architectural choices of neural network models, specifically their attention
mechanisms, which significantly influence the composition and quality of the
generated images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GUI-Spotlight是一个用于图像推理的模型，通过动态调用多个专门工具来迭代缩小屏幕相关区域，显著提高视觉定位准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图形用户界面系统中的实际应用受到视觉定位可靠性的限制，无法准确执行指针级操作如点击或拖动。

Method: 引入GUI-Spotlight模型，训练用于图像推理，动态调用多个专门工具迭代缩小屏幕相关区域。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro基准测试中，仅使用18.5K训练样本的GUI-Spotlight达到52.8%准确率，超越V2P-7B（50.6%，9.6M样本）和GTA-1-7B（50.1%，1.56M样本）。

Conclusion: GUI-Spotlight通过迭代聚焦方法显著提高了视觉定位准确性，在少量训练数据下超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have markedly expanded the
competence of graphical user-interface (GUI) systems, propelling them beyond
controlled simulations into complex, real-world environments across diverse
platforms. However, practical usefulness is still bounded by the reliability of
visual grounding, i.e., mapping textual references to exact on-screen elements.
This limitation prevents the system from accurately performing pointer-level
actions such as clicking or dragging. To address it, we introduce GUI-Spotlight
-- a model trained for image-grounded reasoning that dynamically invokes
multiple specialized tools to iteratively narrow its focus to the relevant
region of the screen, thereby substantially improving visual grounding
accuracy. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Spotlight trained with only
18.5K training samples achieves 52.8\% accuracy, surpassing V2P-7B (50.6\% with
9.6M training samples) and GTA-1-7B (50.1\% with 1.56M training samples).

Abstract: Post-training quantization for reducing the storage of deep neural network
models has been demonstrated to be an effective way in various tasks. However,
low-bit quantization while maintaining model accuracy is a challenging problem.
In this paper, we present a range estimation method to improve the quantization
performance for post-training quantization. We model the range estimation into
an optimization problem of minimizing quantization errors by layer-wise local
minima. We prove this problem is locally convex and present an efficient search
algorithm to find the optimal solution. We propose the application of the above
search algorithm to the transformed weights space to do further improvement in
practice. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art performance generally on top-1 accuracy for image
classification tasks on the ResNet series models and Inception-v3 model. The
experimental results show that the proposed method has almost no loss of top-1
accuracy in 8-bit and 6-bit settings for image classifications, and the
accuracy of 4-bit quantization is also significantly improved. The code is

TL;DR: MetaFind是一个面向元宇宙场景生成的三模态组合检索框架，通过从大规模存储库中检索3D资产来解决资产检索不一致和缺乏标准化检索范式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D资产检索方法存在的两个核心挑战：(i)忽视空间、语义和风格约束的不一致资产检索；(ii)缺乏专门为3D资产检索设计的标准化检索范式。

Method: 提出灵活的检索机制，支持文本、图像和3D模态的任意组合作为查询，通过可插拔的等变布局编码器ESSGNN捕获空间关系和对象外观特征，确保检索的3D资产在上下文和风格上与现有场景一致。

Result: 实证评估表明，在各种检索任务中，MetaFind相比基线方法在空间和风格一致性方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: MetaFind通过三模态组合检索和等变布局编码，有效提升了3D资产检索的空间和风格一致性，支持迭代式场景构建。

Abstract: We present MetaFind, a scene-aware tri-modal compositional retrieval
framework designed to enhance scene generation in the metaverse by retrieving
3D assets from large-scale repositories. MetaFind addresses two core
challenges: (i) inconsistent asset retrieval that overlooks spatial, semantic,
and stylistic constraints, and (ii) the absence of a standardized retrieval
paradigm specifically tailored for 3D asset retrieval, as existing approaches
mainly rely on general-purpose 3D shape representation models. Our key
innovation is a flexible retrieval mechanism that supports arbitrary
combinations of text, image, and 3D modalities as queries, enhancing spatial
reasoning and style consistency by jointly modeling object-level features
(including appearance) and scene-level layout structures. Methodologically,
MetaFind introduces a plug-and-play equivariant layout encoder ESSGNN that
captures spatial relationships and object appearance features, ensuring
retrieved 3D assets are contextually and stylistically coherent with the
existing scene, regardless of coordinate frame transformations. The framework
supports iterative scene construction by continuously adapting retrieval
results to current scene updates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the
improved spatial and stylistic consistency of MetaFind in various retrieval
tasks compared to baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的二元分类框架忽略了耀斑子类间的序数关系，导致模型在预测阈值附近频繁出现误分类。

Method: 在传统的二元交叉熵损失函数中引入序数权重，对接近预测阈值的错误预测施加更重的惩罚。

Result: 该方法通过利用数据的序数特性增强模型学习过程，有望提高整体预测性能。

Conclusion: 整合序数信息的损失函数能有效改善太阳耀斑预测模型在阈值附近的分类准确性。

Abstract: The prediction of solar flares is typically formulated as a binary
classification task, distinguishing events as either Flare (FL) or No-Flare
(NF) according to a specified threshold (for example, greater than or equal to
C-class, M-class, or X-class). However, this binary framework neglects the
inherent ordinal relationships among the sub-classes contained within each
category (FL and NF). Several studies on solar flare prediction have
empirically shown that the most frequent misclassifications occur near this
prediction threshold. This suggests that the models struggle to differentiate
events that are similar in intensity but fall on opposite sides of the binary
threshold. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a modified loss function
that integrates the ordinal information among the sub-classes of the binarized
flare labels into the conventional binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This
approach serves as an ordinality-aware, data-driven regularization method that
penalizes the incorrect predictions of flare events in close proximity to the
prediction threshold more heavily than those away from the boundary during
model optimization. By incorporating ordinal weighting into the loss function,
we aim to enhance the model's learning process by leveraging the ordinal
characteristics of the data, thereby improving its overall performance.

TL;DR: QuantDemoire是一个专为图像去摩尔纹任务设计的后训练量化框架，通过异常值感知量化器和频率感知校准策略，在W4A4量化下比现有方法提升超过4dB，大幅减少参数和计算量同时保持质量。


<details>

Motivation: 现有深度学习去摩尔纹方法需要大量计算资源，难以在边缘设备部署。直接应用现有量化方法会导致严重的性能下降，主要原因是分布异常值和平滑区域表示弱化。

Method: 提出QuantDemoire框架，包含两个关键组件：1）异常值感知量化器，使用基于采样的范围估计减少激活异常值，并将少数极端权重保留为FP16；2）频率感知校准策略，在微调过程中强调低中频分量。

Conclusion: QuantDemoire为去摩尔纹任务提供了一种有效的量化解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了模型部署的计算需求。

Abstract: Demoir\'eing aims to remove moir\'e artifacts that often occur in images.
While recent deep learning-based methods have achieved promising results, they
typically require substantial computational resources, limiting their
deployment on edge devices. Model quantization offers a compelling solution.
However, directly applying existing quantization methods to demoir\'eing models
introduces severe performance degradation. The main reasons are distribution
outliers and weakened representations in smooth regions. To address these
issues, we propose QuantDemoire, a post-training quantization framework
tailored to demoir\'eing. It contains two key components. **First}, we
introduce an outlier-aware quantizer to reduce errors from outliers. It uses
sampling-based range estimation to reduce activation outliers, and keeps a few
extreme weights in FP16 with negligible cost. **Second**, we design a
frequency-aware calibration strategy. It emphasizes low- and mid-frequency
components during fine-tuning, which mitigates banding artifacts caused by
low-bit quantization. Extensive experiments validate that our QuantDemoire
achieves large reductions in parameters and computation while maintaining
quality. Meanwhile, it outperforms existing quantization methods by over **4
dB** on W4A4. Code is released at:

Conclusion: TV-LoRA实现了高保真、高效的3D CT重建，在低剂量稀疏采样场景中具有广泛的临床适用性。

Abstract: This work presents TV-LoRA, a novel method for low-dose sparse-view CT
reconstruction that combines a diffusion generative prior (NCSN++ with SDE
modeling) and multi-regularization constraints, including anisotropic TV and
nuclear norm (LoRA), within an ADMM framework. To address ill-posedness and
texture loss under extremely sparse views, TV-LoRA integrates generative and
physical constraints, and utilizes a 2D slice-based strategy with FFT
acceleration and tensor-parallel optimization for efficient inference.
Experiments on AAPM-2016, CTHD, and LIDC datasets with
$N_{\mathrm{view}}=8,4,2$ show that TV-LoRA consistently surpasses benchmarks
in SSIM, texture recovery, edge clarity, and artifact suppression,
demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability. Ablation studies confirm
the complementary effects of LoRA regularization and diffusion priors, while
the FFT-PCG module provides a speedup. Overall, Diffusion + TV-LoRA achieves
high-fidelity, efficient 3D CT reconstruction and broad clinical applicability
in low-dose, sparse-sampling scenarios.

Abstract: Topological mapping offers a compact and robust representation for
navigation, but progress in the field is hindered by the lack of standardized
evaluation metrics, datasets, and protocols. Existing systems are assessed
using different environments and criteria, preventing fair and reproducible
comparisons. Moreover, a key challenge - perceptual aliasing - remains
under-quantified, despite its strong influence on system performance. We
address these gaps by (1) formalizing topological consistency as the
fundamental property of topological maps and showing that localization accuracy
provides an efficient and interpretable surrogate metric, and (2) proposing the
first quantitative measure of dataset ambiguity to enable fair comparisons
across environments. To support this protocol, we curate a diverse benchmark
dataset with calibrated ambiguity levels, implement and release deep-learned
baseline systems, and evaluate them alongside classical methods. Our
experiments and analysis yield new insights into the limitations of current
approaches under perceptual aliasing. All datasets, baselines, and evaluation
tools are fully open-sourced to foster consistent and reproducible research in
topological mapping.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of event-based meshflow estimation, a
novel task that involves predicting a spatially smooth sparse motion field from
event cameras. To start, we review the state-of-the-art in event-based flow
estimation, highlighting two key areas for further research: i) the lack of
meshflow-specific event datasets and methods, and ii) the underexplored
challenge of event data density. First, we generate a large-scale
High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset, which showcases its superiority
by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280x720, handling dynamic
objects and complex motion patterns, and offering both optical flow and
meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works.
Besides, we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network, a
lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to
facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore, we upgrade
EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow, in which a
Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp
motion boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the exceptional
performance and runtime efficiency (30x faster) of our EEMFlow model compared
to the recent state-of-the-art flow method. As an extension, we expand HREM
into HREM+, a multi-density event dataset contributing to a thorough study of
the robustness of existing methods across data with varying densities, and
propose an Adaptive Density Module (ADM) to adjust the density of input event
data to a more optimal range, enhancing the model's generalization ability. We
empirically demonstrate that ADM helps to significantly improve the performance
of EEMFlow and EEMFlow+ by 8% and 10%, respectively. Code and dataset are

Abstract: Latest diffusion models have shown promising results in category-level 6D
object pose estimation by modeling the conditional pose distribution with depth
image input. The existing methods, however, suffer from slow convergence during
training, learning its encoder with the diffusion denoising network in
end-to-end fashion, and require an additional network that evaluates sampled
pose hypotheses to filter out low-quality pose candidates. In this paper, we
propose a novel pipeline that tackles these limitations by two key components.
First, the proposed method pretrains the encoder with the direct pose
regression head, and jointly learns the networks via the regression head and
the denoising diffusion head, significantly accelerating training convergence
while achieving higher accuracy. Second, sampling guidance via time-dependent
score scaling is proposed s.t. the exploration-exploitation trade-off is
effectively taken, eliminating the need for the additional evaluation network.
The sampling guidance maintains multi-modal characteristics of symmetric
objects at early denoising steps while ensuring high-quality pose generation at
final steps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including REAL275,
HouseCat6D, and ROPE, demonstrate that the proposed method, simple yet
effective, achieves state-of-the-art accuracies even with single-pose
inference, while being more efficient in both training and inference.

Conclusion: 该方法能产生鲁棒、一致且可泛化的模型，为解决多模态大语言模型蒸馏中的概念漂移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper identifies a critical yet underexplored challenge in distilling
from multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the reasoning trajectories
generated by multiple drifting teachers exhibit concept drift, whereby their
reasoning distributions evolve unpredictably and transmit biases to the student
model, ultimately compromising its performance. To tackle this issue, we
pioneer a theoretical connection between concept drift and knowledge
distillation, casting the non-stationary reasoning dynamics from multiple MLLM
teachers as next-token prediction of multi-stream reasoning trajectories.Guided
by concept drift, we introduce the "learn, compare, critique" paradigm,
culminating in autonomous preference optimization (APO). Under the active
guidance of the teachers, the student model first learns and self-distils
preferred thinking by comparing multiple teachers. It then engages in critical
reflection over the drifting inference from teachers, performing concept
alignment through APO, ultimately yielding a robust, consistent, and
generalizable model.Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance
of consistency, robustness and generalization within knowledge distillation.
Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset, CXR-MAX (Multi-teachers
Alignment X-rays), comprising 170,982 distilled reasoning trajectories derived
from publicly accessible MLLMs based on MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public

Motivation: 传统的建筑安全检查方法效率低下，需要处理大量信息。现有的大语言模型应用存在回答不相关、模态输入受限和幻觉问题，且缺乏实时适应性。

Method: 开发了SiteShield框架，结合多模态LVLM和检索增强生成技术，整合视觉和音频输入来生成安全检查报告。

Conclusion: SiteShield为增强信息检索和提高安全报告生成效率提供了一条新途径。

Abstract: Conventional construction safety inspection methods are often inefficient as
they require navigating through large volume of information. Recent advances in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety
inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However,
existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific
responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of
training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces
SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating
visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed
unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04,
precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield
offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in
generating safety reports.

Conclusion: DP-IR框架成功解决了DPM在图像恢复应用中的实用性问题，实现了高效、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have been recently utilized to deal
with various blind image restoration (IR) tasks, where they have demonstrated
outstanding performance in terms of perceptual quality. However, the
task-specific nature of existing solutions and the excessive computational
costs related to their training, make such models impractical and challenging
to use for different IR tasks than those that were initially trained for. This
hinders their wider adoption, especially by those who lack access to powerful
computational resources and vast amount of training data. In this work we aim
to address the above issues and enable the successful adoption of DPMs in
practical IR-related applications. Towards this goal, we propose a modular
diffusion probabilistic IR framework (DP-IR), which allows us to combine the
performance benefits of existing pre-trained state-of-the-art IR networks and
generative DPMs, while it requires only the additional training of a relatively
small module (0.7M params) related to the particular IR task of interest.
Moreover, the architecture of the proposed framework allows for a sampling
strategy that leads to at least four times reduction of neural function
evaluations without suffering any performance loss, while it can also be
combined with existing acceleration techniques such as DDIM. We evaluate our
model on four benchmarks for the tasks of burst JDD-SR, dynamic scene

*Piyush Arora,Navlika Singh,Vasubhya Diwan,Pratik Mazumder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLADE是一种无需先验偏置知识或偏置冲突样本的生成式去偏框架，通过跨偏置域图像转换和自适应精炼来缓解神经网络中的隐式偏置问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络容易学习训练数据中的虚假相关性（偏置），而现有方法通常需要已知偏置或偏置冲突样本，这在现实场景中往往不切实际。

Method: 首先训练生成模型在偏置域间转换图像并保留任务相关特征，然后基于图像对偏置的敏感性自适应精炼图像与其合成对应物，通过对齐任务相关特征但偏置不同的图像来鼓励鲁棒表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著优于最先进方法，在corrupted CIFAR-10数据集的最差组设置下比最接近的基线方法高出约18%的绝对优势。

Conclusion: BLADE为无显式监督开发更鲁棒的深度学习模型建立了新基准，展示了在偏置缓解方面的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Neural networks have revolutionized numerous fields, yet they remain
vulnerable to a critical flaw: the tendency to learn implicit biases, spurious
correlations between certain attributes and target labels in training data.
These biases are often more prevalent and easier to learn, causing models to
rely on superficial patterns rather than task-relevant features necessary for
generalization. Existing methods typically rely on strong assumptions, such as
prior knowledge of these biases or access to bias-conflicting samples, i.e.,
samples that contradict spurious correlations and counterbalance bias-aligned
samples, samples that conform to these spurious correlations. However, such
assumptions are often impractical in real-world settings. We propose BLADE
({B}ias-{L}inked {A}daptive {DE}biasing), a generative debiasing framework that
requires no prior knowledge of bias or bias-conflicting samples. BLADE first
trains a generative model to translate images across bias domains while
preserving task-relevant features. Then, it adaptively refines each image with
its synthetic counterpart based on the image's susceptibility to bias. To
encourage robust representations, BLADE aligns an image with its
bias-translated synthetic counterpart that shares task-relevant features but
differs in bias, while misaligning it with samples sharing the same bias. We
evaluate BLADE on multiple benchmark datasets and show that it significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it exceeds the closest baseline
by an absolute margin of around 18% on the corrupted CIFAR-10 dataset under the
worst group setting, establishing a new benchmark in bias mitigation and
demonstrating its potential for developing more robust deep learning models
without explicit supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强3D高斯泼溅的方法，通过为每个高斯添加纹理映射来提升表达力，解决了原始方法中每个高斯只能表示单一颜色和简单椭球体的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在3D重建和渲染方面表现出色，但每个高斯只能表示单一颜色和简单椭球体，限制了其表达力。

Method: 为每个高斯添加alpha、RGB或RGBA纹理映射，使每个高斯能够表示更丰富的纹理模式和几何结构。

Result: 在多种标准基准数据集上验证，相比现有方法使用相似或更少的高斯数量，实现了图像质量的提升。

Conclusion: 通过纹理映射增强高斯表达力是有效的，特别是使用alpha-only纹理映射可以显著改善表达力，而RGB纹理映射则达到最高表达力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction and rendering technique due to its high-quality results and fast
training and rendering time. However, pixels covered by the same Gaussian are
always shaded in the same color up to a Gaussian falloff scaling factor.
Furthermore, the finest geometric detail any individual Gaussian can represent
is a simple ellipsoid. These properties of 3DGS greatly limit the expressivity
of individual Gaussian primitives. To address these issues, we draw inspiration
from texture and alpha mapping in traditional graphics and integrate it with
3DGS. Specifically, we propose a new generalized Gaussian appearance
representation that augments each Gaussian with alpha~(A), RGB, or RGBA texture
maps to model spatially varying color and opacity across the extent of each
Gaussian. As such, each Gaussian can represent a richer set of texture patterns
and geometric structures, instead of just a single color and ellipsoid as in
naive Gaussian Splatting. Surprisingly, we found that the expressivity of
Gaussians can be greatly improved by using alpha-only texture maps, and further
augmenting Gaussians with RGB texture maps achieves the highest expressivity.
We validate our method on a wide variety of standard benchmark datasets and our
own custom captures at both the object and scene levels. We demonstrate image
quality improvements over existing methods while using a similar or lower
number of Gaussians.

TL;DR: 提出了SEG-MIL-CBM框架，将概念引导的图像分割与注意力多示例学习结合，通过语义区域推理实现透明、空间定位的概念级解释，无需概念标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络缺乏可解释性，在安全关键应用中限制信任。现有概念瓶颈模型需要昂贵概念标注且缺乏空间定位，无法识别支持每个概念的区域。

Method: 集成概念引导图像分割到注意力多示例学习框架，将分割区域作为实例，学习跨区域证据聚合，通过语义对齐区域推理突出任务相关证据。

Result: 在涉及虚假相关性、输入损坏和大规模基准测试中实现稳健性能，同时提供透明概念级解释。

Conclusion: SEG-MIL-CBM通过空间定位的概念推理，在保持高性能的同时提供可解释性，无需额外概念标注。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision;
however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and
trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is
crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not
only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading
features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their
explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by
reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly
concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which
regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that
integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple
instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an
instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning
over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our
model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and
produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring
annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance
across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies
between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade
visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent,
concept-level explanations.

TL;DR: 提出HyCa框架，通过维度级缓存策略加速扩散变换器采样，实现5.55-6.24倍加速且几乎无损


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器的迭代采样过程因每次时间步的变换器前向传播成本高而成为主要瓶颈，现有特征缓存方法对所有特征维度采用统一策略，忽略了它们异质的动态行为

Method: 将隐藏特征演化建模为跨维度的ODE混合，引入HyCa混合ODE求解器启发的缓存框架，应用维度级缓存策略

Result: 在FLUX上实现5.55倍加速，HunyuanVideo上5.56倍加速，Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit上6.24倍加速，无需重新训练

Conclusion: HyCa框架通过维度级缓存策略有效加速扩散变换器采样，在多个领域和模型上实现近无损的大幅加速

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers offer state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video
synthesis, but their iterative sampling process remains a major bottleneck due
to the high cost of transformer forward passes at each timestep. To mitigate
this, feature caching has emerged as a training-free acceleration technique
that reuses or forecasts hidden representations. However, existing methods
often apply a uniform caching strategy across all feature dimensions, ignoring
their heterogeneous dynamic behaviors. Therefore, we adopt a new perspective by
modeling hidden feature evolution as a mixture of ODEs across dimensions, and
introduce HyCa, a Hybrid ODE solver inspired caching framework that applies
dimension-wise caching strategies. HyCa achieves near-lossless acceleration
across diverse domains and models, including 5.55 times speedup on FLUX, 5.56
times speedup on HunyuanVideo, 6.24 times speedup on Qwen-Image and
Qwen-Image-Edit without retraining.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像模型在遇到新颖或分布外实体时性能显著下降的问题，由于模型固有的知识截止限制。

Method: 设计代理动态搜索网络获取基础模型未知概念的图像，然后进行多模态提示优化，引导生成模型实现准确合成。

Result: 在NICE基准测试中，语义对齐准确率比现有最优方法提升+8.1%，在不到三次迭代中高效实现结果。

Conclusion: 该框架为T2I系统提供了更好反映不断变化的现实世界的能力，实现了语义保真度和视觉美学的显著提升。

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models can synthesize high-quality images, their
performance degrades significantly when prompted with novel or
out-of-distribution (OOD) entities due to inherent knowledge cutoffs. We
introduce World-To-Image, a novel framework that bridges this gap by empowering
T2I generation with agent-driven world knowledge. We design an agent that
dynamically searches the web to retrieve images for concepts unknown to the
base model. This information is then used to perform multimodal prompt
optimization, steering powerful generative backbones toward an accurate
synthesis. Critically, our evaluation goes beyond traditional metrics,
utilizing modern assessments like LLMGrader and ImageReward to measure true
semantic fidelity. Our experiments show that World-To-Image substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic alignment and visual
aesthetics, achieving +8.1% improvement in accuracy-to-prompt on our curated
NICE benchmark. Our framework achieves these results with high efficiency in
less than three iterations, paving the way for T2I systems that can better
reflect the ever-changing real world. Our demo code is available

TL;DR: 提出MASC框架，通过构建层次化语义树来优化自回归图像生成模型，解决了传统扁平词汇表导致的训练效率低下和生成质量受限问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型使用扁平的视觉标记词汇表，忽略了标记嵌入空间的固有结构，导致预测任务复杂，训练效率低且生成质量受限。

Method: MASC框架使用几何感知距离度量和密度驱动的凝聚构造方法，从码本固有结构中直接构建层次化语义树，将高维扁平预测任务转化为结构化层次化任务。

Result: MASC将训练速度提升高达57%，显著改善生成质量，将LlamaGen-XL的FID从2.87降低到2.58，使现有AR框架与最先进方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 结构化预测空间对于可扩展生成建模与架构创新同等重要，MASC证明了通过建模标记嵌入空间的内在流形结构可以显著提升自回归图像生成性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have shown great promise in image generation, yet
they face a fundamental inefficiency stemming from their core component: a
vast, unstructured vocabulary of visual tokens. This conventional approach
treats tokens as a flat vocabulary, disregarding the intrinsic structure of the
token embedding space where proximity often correlates with semantic
similarity. This oversight results in a highly complex prediction task, which
hinders training efficiency and limits final generation quality. To resolve
this, we propose Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC), a principled
framework that constructs a hierarchical semantic tree directly from the
codebook's intrinsic structure. MASC employs a novel geometry-aware distance
metric and a density-driven agglomerative construction to model the underlying
manifold of the token embeddings. By transforming the flat, high-dimensional
prediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a
beneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem
for the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive
experiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57%
and significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL
from 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly
competitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the
prediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable
generative modeling.

Method: 提出ZoomIn两阶段取证框架：首先扫描图像定位可疑区域，然后对放大区域进行聚焦分析。使用MagniFake数据集（2万张真实和高质量合成图像，带边界框和取证解释）进行训练。

Result: 该方法达到96.39%的准确率，具有强大的泛化能力，并提供基于视觉证据的人类可理解解释。

Conclusion: ZoomIn框架在AI生成图像检测方面实现了高准确性和可解释性，为数字取证提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI-generated imagery has blurred the boundary between
real and synthetic content, raising critical concerns for digital integrity.
Vision-language models (VLMs) offer interpretability through explanations but
often fail to detect subtle artifacts in high-quality synthetic images. We
propose ZoomIn, a two-stage forensic framework that improves both accuracy and
interpretability. Mimicking human visual inspection, ZoomIn first scans an
image to locate suspicious regions and then performs a focused analysis on
these zoomed-in areas to deliver a grounded verdict. To support training, we
introduce MagniFake, a dataset of 20,000 real and high-quality synthetic images
annotated with bounding boxes and forensic explanations, generated through an
automated VLM-based pipeline. Our method achieves 96.39% accuracy with robust
generalization, while providing human-understandable explanations grounded in
visual evidence.

Motivation: 解决图像配准问题，即寻找使两幅图像对应点位置一致的变换，需要一种简单高效的算法来应对训练数据、训练时间和代码复杂度的限制。

Method: 开发了端到端可训练的算法，使用少量Python代码实现，通过74张图像在19x15输入窗口上进行训练，适用于立体视觉等应用场景。

Result: 该算法在训练数据和训练时间有限的情况下仍能获得准确结果，代码简洁（仅需十几行Python），在相关受限场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: 这种简洁的算法为训练数据、训练时间或代码复杂度受限的相关场景提供了一个良好的起点，展示了在有限资源下实现有效图像配准的可行性。

Abstract: The problem of image registration is finding a transformation that aligns two
images, such that the corresponding points are in the same location. This paper
introduces a simple, end-to-end trainable algorithm that is implementable in a
few lines of Python code. The approach is shown to work with very little
training data and training time, while achieving accurate results in some
settings. An example application to stereo vision was trained from 74 images on
a 19x15 input window. With just a dozen lines of Python code this algorithm
excels in brevity and may serve as a good start in related scenarios with
limitations to training data, training time or code complexity.

Motivation: 提高深度神经网络模型的可访问性，特别是在移动设备上运行眼疾诊断任务。现有方法计算复杂，难以在资源受限的设备上部署。

Method: 重新设计和优化卷积层，提出新型ArConv卷积层，构建参数更少的通用模型。最终模型仅包含130万个参数。

Conclusion: 通过优化卷积层设计，成功开发出计算效率高、精度优异的轻量级神经网络模型，为移动设备上的眼疾诊断提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are continually evolving, with some efforts
aimed at improving accuracy, others at increasing speed, and some at enhancing
accessibility. Improving accessibility broadens the application of neural
networks across a wider range of tasks, including the detection of eye
diseases. Early diagnosis of eye diseases and consulting an ophthalmologist can
prevent many vision disorders. Given the importance of this issue, various
datasets have been collected from the cornea to facilitate the process of
making neural network models. However, most of the methods introduced in the
past are computationally complex. In this study, we tried to increase the
accessibility of deep neural network models. We did this at the most
fundamental level, specifically by redesigning and optimizing the convolutional
layers. By doing so, we created a new general model that incorporates our novel
convolutional layer named ArConv layers. Thanks to the efficient performance of
this new layer, the model has suitable complexity for use in mobile phones and
can perform the task of diagnosing the presence of disease with high accuracy.
The final model we present contains only 1.3 million parameters. In comparison
to the MobileNetV2 model, which has 2.2 million parameters, our model
demonstrated better accuracy when trained and evaluated on the RfMiD dataset
under identical conditions, achieving an accuracy of 0.9328 versus 0.9266 on
the RfMiD test set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统3D渲染方法对显式3D表示和大量相机标注数据的依赖，通过统一3D和视频建模框架，利用大规模视频数据进行预训练。

Method: 使用仅解码器的整流流变换器，通过掩码自回归框架实现任意数量参考视图到任意数量目标视图的6自由度生成，将3D建模统一为视频序列生成任务。

Result: 在多个视图合成基准测试中达到最先进水平，零样本性能在少视图设置中显著优于其他生成方法，在多视图设置中首次达到逐场景优化方法的质量。

Conclusion: Kaleido通过将3D视为视频子域的统一框架，实现了高质量的生成式神经渲染，减少了对稀缺3D数据的依赖，并在各种设置下表现出色。

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a family of generative models designed for
photorealistic, unified object- and scene-level neural rendering. Kaleido
operates on the principle that 3D can be regarded as a specialised sub-domain
of video, expressed purely as a sequence-to-sequence image synthesis task.
Through a systemic study of scaling sequence-to-sequence generative neural
rendering, we introduce key architectural innovations that enable our model to:
i) perform generative view synthesis without explicit 3D representations; ii)
generate any number of 6-DoF target views conditioned on any number of
reference views via a masked autoregressive framework; and iii) seamlessly
unify 3D and video modelling within a single decoder-only rectified flow
transformer. Within this unified framework, Kaleido leverages large-scale video
data for pre-training, which significantly improves spatial consistency and
reduces reliance on scarce, camera-labelled 3D datasets -- all without any
architectural modifications. Kaleido sets a new state-of-the-art on a range of
view synthesis benchmarks. Its zero-shot performance substantially outperforms
other generative methods in few-view settings, and, for the first time, matches
the quality of per-scene optimisation methods in many-view settings.

Method: 基于nnU-Netv2构建紧凑分割框架，集成半监督均值教师方案利用未标注数据，包含随机化直方图风格外观转换和可训练对比感知网络的域适应模块，采用持续测试时适应策略。

Result: 在广泛实验中，该框架始终优于nnU-Netv2基线，获得更高的Dice分数和更低的Hausdorff距离，在低标注条件下对未见域表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoSSeg-TTA框架有效解决了肝脏MRI分割中的域泛化挑战，为临床诊断和治疗规划提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation from contrast-enhanced MRI is essential for
diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, it remains
challenging due to limited annotated data, heterogeneous enhancement protocols,
and significant domain shifts across scanners and institutions. Traditional
image-to-image translation frameworks have made great progress in domain
generalization, but their application is not straightforward. For example,
Pix2Pix requires image registration, and cycle-GAN cannot be integrated
seamlessly into segmentation pipelines. Meanwhile, these methods are originally
used to deal with cross-modality scenarios, and often introduce structural
distortions and suffer from unstable training, which may pose drawbacks in our
single-modality scenario. To address these challenges, we propose CoSSeg-TTA, a
compact segmentation framework for the GED4 (Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced hepatobiliary
phase MRI) modality built upon nnU-Netv2 and enhanced with a semi-supervised
mean teacher scheme to exploit large amounts of unlabeled volumes. A domain
adaptation module, incorporating a randomized histogram-based style appearance
transfer function and a trainable contrast-aware network, enriches domain
diversity and mitigates cross-center variability. Furthermore, a continual
test-time adaptation strategy is employed to improve robustness during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms the nnU-Netv2 baseline, achieving superior Dice score and Hausdorff
Distance while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen domains under
low-annotation conditions.

Motivation: 现有防御方法通常需要预先知道补丁大小或位置，限制了实际应用。需要开发不依赖补丁先验知识的防御策略。

Method: 利用基于概念的解释来识别和抑制最具影响力的概念激活向量，从而在不显式检测的情况下中和补丁效应。

Result: 在Imagenette数据集和ResNet-50模型上评估，相比最先进的PatchCleanser方法，获得了更高的鲁棒性和干净准确率，在不同补丁大小和位置下保持强性能。

Conclusion: 将可解释性与鲁棒性结合具有前景，概念驱动的防御是对抗对抗补丁攻击的可扩展策略。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a practical threat to deep learning models by
forcing targeted misclassifications through localized perturbations, often
realized in the physical world. Existing defenses typically assume prior
knowledge of patch size or location, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose a patch-agnostic defense that leverages concept-based
explanations to identify and suppress the most influential concept activation
vectors, thereby neutralizing patch effects without explicit detection.
Evaluated on Imagenette with a ResNet-50, our method achieves higher robust and
clean accuracy than the state-of-the-art PatchCleanser, while maintaining
strong performance across varying patch sizes and locations. Our results
highlight the promise of combining interpretability with robustness and suggest
concept-driven defenses as a scalable strategy for securing machine learning
models against adversarial patch attacks.

Motivation: 现有基于transformer的序列视觉地点识别方法过于关注性能而忽视了灵活性、推理速度和内存使用效率，无法满足实际应用中的实时性要求。

Method: 提出Recurrent Deformable Transformer Encoder（循环可变形Transformer编码器），通过迭代循环机制融合多帧序列信息，支持可变序列长度。

Result: 在Nordland、Oxford和NuScenes数据集上，召回率提升高达17%，序列提取时间减少36%，内存使用降低35%。

Conclusion: Adapt-STformer在保持高性能的同时实现了灵活性、快速推理和低内存使用，为序列视觉地点识别提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Sequential Visual Place Recognition (Seq-VPR) leverages transformers to
capture spatio-temporal features effectively; however, existing approaches
prioritize performance at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. In
practice, a transformer-based Seq-VPR model should be flexible to the number of
frames per sequence (seq-length), deliver fast inference, and have low memory
usage to meet real-time constraints. To our knowledge, no existing
transformer-based Seq-VPR method achieves both flexibility and efficiency. To
address this gap, we propose Adapt-STformer, a Seq-VPR method built around our
novel Recurrent Deformable Transformer Encoder (Recurrent-DTE), which uses an
iterative recurrent mechanism to fuse information from multiple sequential
frames. This design naturally supports variable seq-lengths, fast inference,
and low memory usage. Experiments on the Nordland, Oxford, and NuScenes
datasets show that Adapt-STformer boosts recall by up to 17% while reducing
sequence extraction time by 36% and lowering memory usage by 35% compared to
the second-best baseline.

Motivation: 当前大型生成模型在图像编辑和上下文图像生成方面取得进展，但缺乏物理一致性保证，这在世界模拟任务中尤为重要。

Method: 将输入和编辑图像视为视频的首尾帧，利用预训练视频生成模型；引入时序推理阶段，在推理时联合去噪目标帧和推理标记以生成物理可行的编辑轨迹。

Conclusion: ChronoEdit通过将图像编辑重构为视频生成问题，有效解决了物理一致性问题，为需要物理合理性的编辑任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have significantly advanced image
editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring
physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This
capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this
paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a
video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images
as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large
pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but
also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal
consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that
explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target
frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing
trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable
transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to
avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate
ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for
contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical
plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit
will be released on the project page:

TL;DR: CARE-PD是最大的公开帕金森病3D步态数据集，包含来自8个临床中心的9个队列数据，支持临床评分预测和无监督运动任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病的客观步态评估受限于缺乏大型、多样且临床标注的运动数据集。

Method: 将所有记录转换为匿名SMPL网格，支持监督临床评分预测和无监督运动预训练任务。

Result: 运动编码器持续优于手工特征，在CARE-PD上预训练显著降低MPJPE并提升PD严重度分类性能。

Conclusion: CARE-PD展示了临床策划的多样化训练数据在帕金森病评估中的价值，所有数据和代码已公开用于非商业研究。

Abstract: Objective gait assessment in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is limited by the
absence of large, diverse, and clinically annotated motion datasets. We
introduce CARE-PD, the largest publicly available archive of 3D mesh gait data
for PD, and the first multi-site collection spanning 9 cohorts from 8 clinical
centers. All recordings (RGB video or motion capture) are converted into
anonymized SMPL meshes via a harmonized preprocessing pipeline. CARE-PD
supports two key benchmarks: supervised clinical score prediction (estimating
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS, gait scores) and unsupervised
motion pretext tasks (2D-to-3D keypoint lifting and full-body 3D
reconstruction). Clinical prediction is evaluated under four generalization
protocols: within-dataset, cross-dataset, leave-one-dataset-out, and
multi-dataset in-domain adaptation. To assess clinical relevance, we compare
state-of-the-art motion encoders with a traditional gait-feature baseline,
finding that encoders consistently outperform handcrafted features. Pretraining
on CARE-PD reduces MPJPE (from 60.8mm to 7.5mm) and boosts PD severity macro-F1
by 17 percentage points, underscoring the value of clinically curated, diverse
training data. CARE-PD and all benchmark code are released for non-commercial
research at https://neurips2025.care-pd.ca/.

*Jiarui Ouyang,Yihui Wang,Yihang Gao,Yingxue Xu,Shu Yang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenAR是一个多尺度自回归框架，通过将基因聚类为层次组来建模基因间依赖关系，直接预测原始计数而非连续值，利用组织学和空间嵌入进行条件解码，在空间转录组学数据上实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学(ST)成本高昂，而从广泛可用的H&E染色图像预测基因表达是更经济的选择。现有方法存在两个问题：(i)独立预测每个基因，忽略了共表达结构；(ii)将任务视为连续回归，而表达本质是离散计数，这会导致生物学上不合理的输出并复杂化下游分析。

Method: GenAR采用多尺度自回归框架，从粗到精细化预测。方法包括：将基因聚类为层次组以揭示跨基因依赖关系；将表达建模为无码本的离散标记生成，直接预测原始计数；在解码时融合组织学和空间嵌入进行条件生成。

Result: 在四个不同组织类型的空间转录组学数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，GenAR实现了最先进的性能，为精准医学和经济高效的分子分析提供了潜在应用价值。

Conclusion: GenAR通过离散建模和层次基因分组，有效解决了现有方法的问题，避免了log诱导的偏差，粗到精的分解与原则性条件分解一致，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) offers spatially resolved gene expression but
remains costly. Predicting expression directly from widely available
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images presents a cost-effective
alternative. However, most computational approaches (i) predict each gene
independently, overlooking co-expression structure, and (ii) cast the task as
continuous regression despite expression being discrete counts. This mismatch
can yield biologically implausible outputs and complicate downstream analyses.
We introduce GenAR, a multi-scale autoregressive framework that refines
predictions from coarse to fine. GenAR clusters genes into hierarchical groups
to expose cross-gene dependencies, models expression as codebook-free discrete
token generation to directly predict raw counts, and conditions decoding on
fused histological and spatial embeddings. From an information-theoretic
perspective, the discrete formulation avoids log-induced biases and the
coarse-to-fine factorization aligns with a principled conditional
decomposition. Extensive experimental results on four Spatial Transcriptomics
datasets across different tissue types demonstrate that GenAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, offering potential implications for precision
medicine and cost-effective molecular profiling. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出RAP方法，通过轻量级3D栅格化和特征对齐技术增强端到端驾驶规划的数据增强，无需逼真渲染即可提升模型鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模仿学习缺乏恢复数据，小错误会累积导致失败。现有方法使用神经渲染或游戏引擎成本过高，而驾驶规划主要依赖几何和动态信息而非纹理光照

Method: 使用3D栅格化替代昂贵渲染，生成对抗性恢复动作和跨智能体视图合成，并通过Raster-to-Real特征空间对齐弥合仿真与现实差距

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2、Waymo Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving和Bench2Drive四个基准测试中取得最优成绩，实现最先进的闭环鲁棒性和长尾泛化能力

Conclusion: 轻量级栅格化配合特征对齐足以扩展端到端训练，为逼真渲染提供了实用替代方案

Abstract: Imitation learning for end-to-end driving trains policies only on expert
demonstrations. Once deployed in a closed loop, such policies lack recovery
data: small mistakes cannot be corrected and quickly compound into failures. A
promising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories
beyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via
neural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and
costly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that
photorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is
semantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics,
not textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which
replaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated
primitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers
and cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively
to real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment
that bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization
Augmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning.
RAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail
generalization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo
Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive. Our results show that
lightweight rasterization with feature alignment suffices to scale E2E
training, offering a practical alternative to photorealistic rendering. Project

TL;DR: 提出Diffusion^2框架用于瞬时轨迹预测，通过两个连接的扩散模型分别进行历史轨迹生成和未来轨迹预测，解决了盲区行人突然出现等极端场景下的预测挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中如盲区突然出现行人时，往往缺乏足够的观测数据（瞬时轨迹），导致准确预测困难并增加交通事故风险，因此需要研究极端场景下的行人轨迹预测。

Method: 使用两个序列连接的扩散模型：一个用于反向预测生成未观测的历史轨迹，另一个用于前向预测未来轨迹；提出双头参数化机制估计不确定性，并设计时间自适应噪声模块动态调节噪声尺度。

Result: 在ETH/UCY和Stanford Drone数据集上实现了最先进的瞬时轨迹预测性能。

Conclusion: Diffusion^2框架通过生成历史轨迹和动态噪声调节，有效解决了瞬时轨迹预测问题，显著提升了极端场景下的预测准确性。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier
studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future
trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly
emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable
(i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and
increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on
pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for
enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed
Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists
of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction,
which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward
prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated
unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a
dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty
and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the
noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a
new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford
Drone datasets.

Conclusion: MorphoSim框架成功解决了现有方法的局限性，为机器人技术提供了可扩展的训练数据、可重现的评估和灵活的任务设计能力。

Abstract: World models that support controllable

  for robotics, enabling scalable training data, repro ducible evaluation, and
flexible task design. While
  recent text-to-video models generate realistic dynam ics, they are
constrained to 2D views and offer limited
  interaction. We introduce MorphoSim, a language guided framework that
generates 4D scenes with
  multi-view consistency and object-level controls. From
  natural language instructions, MorphoSim produces
  dynamic environments where objects can be directed,
  recolored, or removed, and scenes can be observed
  from arbitrary viewpoints. The framework integrates
  trajectory-guided generation with feature field dis tillation, allowing edits
to be applied interactively
  without full re-generation. Experiments show that Mor phoSim maintains high
scene fidelity while enabling
  controllability and editability. The code is available

TL;DR: 该论文提出了VLMCountBench基准测试，发现当前视觉语言模型在单一形状计数时表现可靠，但在组合形状计数时存在显著失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在多种任务上表现出色，但作者质疑它们是否能正确计数物体，特别是在组合场景中。

Method: 创建VLMCountBench基准，使用基本几何形状及其组合，严格控制变量，系统研究颜色、大小和提示优化等简单属性的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，VLMs在单一形状类型存在时计数可靠，但在多种形状类型组合时出现显著失败。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在组合计数方面存在基本经验限制，这为未来研究指明了重要方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a central focus of today's AI
community, owing to their impressive abilities gained from training on
large-scale vision-language data from the Web. These models have demonstrated
strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video
understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these
noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects
correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark,
VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric
shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively
on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict
independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple
properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation.
Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one
shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape
types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a
fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important
directions for future research.

TL;DR: CodeFormer++是一个用于盲脸恢复的新框架，通过分解任务、语义对齐和动态融合生成特征与身份特征，在保持身份一致性的同时实现高质量人脸恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有盲脸恢复方法在视觉质量和身份保真度之间存在权衡，导致要么身份失真，要么降质去除不理想。需要一种能同时实现高质量恢复和身份保持的方法。

Method: 将盲脸恢复分解为三个子任务：身份保持的人脸恢复、高质量人脸生成、身份特征与纹理细节的动态融合。使用基于学习的可变形人脸配准模块、纹理引导恢复网络，以及结合深度度量学习来融合特征。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据集上的广泛实验表明，CodeFormer++在视觉保真度和身份一致性方面都取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: CodeFormer++通过最大化生成先验的效用，成功解决了盲脸恢复中视觉质量与身份保真度之间的权衡问题，实现了高质量的人脸恢复同时保持身份一致性。

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) has attracted increasing attention with the rise
of generative methods. Most existing approaches integrate generative priors
into the restoration pro- cess, aiming to jointly address facial detail
generation and identity preservation. However, these methods often suffer from
a trade-off between visual quality and identity fidelity, leading to either
identity distortion or suboptimal degradation removal. In this paper, we
present CodeFormer++, a novel framework that maximizes the utility of
generative priors for high-quality face restoration while preserving identity.
We decompose BFR into three sub-tasks: (i) identity- preserving face
restoration, (ii) high-quality face generation, and (iii) dynamic fusion of
identity features with realistic texture details. Our method makes three key
contributions: (1) a learning-based deformable face registration module that
semantically aligns generated and restored faces; (2) a texture guided
restoration network to dynamically extract and transfer the texture of
generated face to boost the quality of identity-preserving restored face; and
(3) the integration of deep metric learning for BFR with the generation of
informative positive and hard negative samples to better fuse identity-
preserving and generative features. Extensive experiments on real-world and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that, the pro- posed CodeFormer++ achieves
superior performance in terms of both visual fidelity and identity consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出A.I.R.方法，一种无需训练的自适应迭代推理框架选择方法，用于视频问答任务，平衡计算成本与选择准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频问答中的帧选择方法面临关键权衡：轻量级相似度模型无法捕捉复杂查询的细微差别，而使用VLM进行深度分析虽然准确但计算成本过高。

Method: 利用强大的VLM对复杂查询进行深度语义分析，在成本效益高的迭代循环中处理少量高潜力帧，实现自适应、迭代和基于推理的帧选择。

Result: 在多个VideoQA基准测试中，该方法优于现有帧选择方法，显著提升了基础VLM的性能，并大幅提高了计算效率。

Conclusion: A.I.R.方法有效解决了视频问答中帧选择的准确性与计算效率之间的平衡问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Effectively applying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to Video Question
Answering (VideoQA) hinges on selecting a concise yet comprehensive set of
frames, as processing entire videos is computationally infeasible. However,
current frame selection methods face a critical trade-off: approaches relying
on lightweight similarity models, such as CLIP, often fail to capture the
nuances of complex queries, resulting in inaccurate similarity scores that
cannot reflect the authentic query-frame relevance, which further undermines
frame selection. Meanwhile, methods that leverage a VLM for deeper analysis
achieve higher accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs. To address
these limitations, we propose A.I.R., a training-free approach for Adaptive,
Iterative, and Reasoning-based frame selection. We leverage a powerful VLM to
perform deep, semantic analysis on complex queries, and this analysis is
deployed within a cost-effective iterative loop that processes only a small
batch of the most high-potential frames at a time. Extensive experiments on
various VideoQA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
frame selection methods, significantly boosts the performance of the foundation
VLM, and achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency over other
VLM-based techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出reAR训练策略，通过token-wise正则化解决视觉自回归生成中的生成器-分词器不一致问题，显著提升性能，在ImageNet上达到与更大扩散模型相当的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归生成性能落后于扩散模型，核心瓶颈是生成器与分词器的不一致性——AR生成的token可能无法被分词器良好解码。

Method: reAR训练策略：在预测下一个token时，因果transformer同时学习恢复当前token的视觉嵌入，并在噪声上下文中预测目标token的嵌入。无需改变分词器、生成顺序、推理流程或外部模型。

Result: 在ImageNet上，gFID从3.02降至1.86，IS提升至316.9。应用于先进分词器时，仅用1.77亿参数达到gFID 1.42，与6.75亿参数的最先进扩散模型性能相当。

Conclusion: reAR通过简单的token-wise正则化有效解决了生成器-分词器不一致问题，显著提升了视觉自回归生成的性能，使其能与更大的扩散模型竞争。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (AR) generation offers a promising path toward unifying
vision and language models, yet its performance remains suboptimal against
diffusion models. Prior work often attributes this gap to tokenizer limitations
and rasterization ordering. In this work, we identify a core bottleneck from
the perspective of generator-tokenizer inconsistency, i.e., the AR-generated
tokens may not be well-decoded by the tokenizer. To address this, we propose
reAR, a simple training strategy introducing a token-wise regularization
objective: when predicting the next token, the causal transformer is also
trained to recover the visual embedding of the current token and predict the
embedding of the target token under a noisy context. It requires no changes to
the tokenizer, generation order, inference pipeline, or external models.
Despite its simplicity, reAR substantially improves performance. On ImageNet,
it reduces gFID from 3.02 to 1.86 and improves IS to 316.9 using a standard
rasterization-based tokenizer. When applied to advanced tokenizers, it achieves
a gFID of 1.42 with only 177M parameters, matching the performance with larger
state-of-the-art diffusion models (675M).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前伪装目标检测方法依赖堆叠复杂组件（如边界模块、注意力机制、多尺度处理器），导致计算负担增加但性能提升不成比例，且需要降低分辨率处理而丢失精细细节。

Method: 采用统一架构设计，通过通道校准和空间增强整合多尺度特征，边界直接从上下文丰富的表示中产生，保持语义-空间对齐，并采用渐进式细化实现尺度自适应边缘调制。

Result: 在CAMO数据集上达到0.887 Sα，COD10K上0.890，NC4K上0.895，同时保持实时推理速度，能够处理从微小复杂物体到大型模式相似物体的各种尺度目标。

Conclusion: SPEGNet在边界精度和区域一致性之间取得了平衡，能够有效处理遮挡和模糊边界，在多个数据集上表现出色且计算效率高。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection segments objects with intrinsic similarity and
edge disruption. Current detection methods rely on accumulated complex
components. Each approach adds components such as boundary modules, attention
mechanisms, and multi-scale processors independently. This accumulation creates
a computational burden without proportional gains. To manage this complexity,
they process at reduced resolutions, eliminating fine details essential for
camouflage. We present SPEGNet, addressing fragmentation through a unified
design. The architecture integrates multi-scale features via channel
calibration and spatial enhancement. Boundaries emerge directly from
context-rich representations, maintaining semantic-spatial alignment.
Progressive refinement implements scale-adaptive edge modulation with peak
influence at intermediate resolutions. This design strikes a balance between
boundary precision and regional consistency. SPEGNet achieves 0.887 $S_\alpha$
on CAMO, 0.890 on COD10K, and 0.895 on NC4K, with real-time inference speed.
Our approach excels across scales, from tiny, intricate objects to large,
pattern-similar ones, while handling occlusion and ambiguous boundaries. Code,

medical imaging. We introduce MedCLM, an automated pipeline that converts
detection datasets into large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA)
data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by linking lesion boxes to organ

for visual grounding, a Medium stage that encourages implicit localization, and
a Hard stage for weakly supervised reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate
that MedCLM attains state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA
benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for developing clinically aligned

question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We
further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation and editing technologies have enabled
state-of-the-art models to achieve impressive results in general domains.
However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often
encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce
TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain.
Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training
strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while
maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for
data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline,
encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to
acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing
data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a
hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting
modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a
two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first

TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both
objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.

*Zijing Hu,Yunze Tong,Fengda Zhang,Junkun Yuan,Jun Xiao,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出异步扩散模型框架，通过为不同像素分配不同时间步长，让提示相关区域比无关区域更渐进地去噪，从而利用更清晰的像素间上下文，显著提升文本到图像的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用同步去噪，所有像素同时从随机噪声演变为清晰图像，导致提示相关区域只能参考相同噪声水平的无关区域，无法获得清晰上下文，最终损害文本到图像的对齐效果。

Method: 提出异步扩散模型框架，为不同像素分配不同的时间步长，动态调制单个像素的时间步调度，使提示相关区域比无关区域更渐进地去噪。

Result: 大量实验表明，异步扩散模型能够显著提高各种提示下的文本到图像对齐效果。

Conclusion: 异步扩散模型通过异步去噪机制，让提示相关区域能够利用更清晰的像素间上下文，从而在最终图像中实现更好的对齐效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating high-quality
images. Yet, they often struggle to faithfully align the generated images with
the input prompts. This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all
pixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result,
during generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated
regions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately
impairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose
asynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct
timesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising
process. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels,
prompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions,
thereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently,
these prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can
significantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts. The code
repository for this work is available at https://github.com/hu-zijing/AsynDM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了切线放大引导（TAG），一种高效的扩散模型引导方法，通过放大轨迹信号的切向分量来修正采样轨迹，无需修改底层模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像生成中常出现语义不一致或幻觉问题，现有引导方法依赖外部信号或架构修改，计算开销大。

Method: 利用中间样本作为投影基，放大估计分数的切向分量，通过一阶泰勒展开形式化引导过程，将状态导向高概率区域。

Result: TAG作为即插即用模块，以最小计算开销提升扩散采样保真度，提供新的扩散引导视角。

Conclusion: TAG是一种高效直接的引导方法，能有效减少语义不一致，提高样本质量，且架构无关。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image
generation, but often suffer from semantic inconsistencies or hallucinations.
While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they
often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural
modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this
paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and
direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without
modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample
as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated
scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We
formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion,
which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state
toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and
enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module
that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition,
offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.

*Honglin Liu,Chao Sun,Peng Hu,Yunfan Li,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出条件表示学习（CRL）方法，通过LLM生成描述性文本来构建语义基，利用VLM将图像表示投影到条件特征空间中，为任意用户指定标准提取定制化表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示学习方法学习通用表示，主要捕获主导语义，可能与定制化下游任务不匹配。现有方法需要监督微调，计算和标注成本高。

Method: 利用LLM根据用户指定标准生成描述性文本构建语义基，然后通过VLM将图像表示投影到该条件特征空间中。

Result: 在分类和检索任务上的大量实验证明了CRL的优越性和通用性。

Conclusion: CRL能够为特定标准提取更好的语义表示，可用于多个定制化任务。

Abstract: Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation
that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with
customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis,
researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings
emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution,
existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high
computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional
Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to
arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics
of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive
words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon
this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large
language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic
basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature
space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation
better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized
for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and
retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL.

TL;DR: 开发了AI Session Recorder系统，通过记录病理学家在数字切片查看器中的导航行为，构建Pathology-CoT数据集，并训练Pathologist-o3智能体系统，在胃肠道淋巴结转移检测中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前病理学基础模型虽然强大，但缺乏能够模拟专家查看行为（调整放大倍数、移动视野）的实用智能体系统，主要障碍是缺乏临床对齐的专家行为监督数据。

Method: 使用AI Session Recorder记录病理学家在WSI查看器中的导航日志，转换为标准化行为命令；通过轻量级人工审核创建Pathology-CoT数据集；构建两阶段智能体Pathologist-o3，先提出感兴趣区域，再进行行为引导推理。

Result: 在胃肠道淋巴结转移检测任务中，达到84.5%精确率、100.0%召回率和75.4%准确率，超越了OpenAI o3模型，并在不同骨干网络上表现出良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架将日常查看日志转化为可扩展的专家验证监督数据，使病理学智能体系统实用化，为人类对齐、可升级的临床AI建立了路径。

Abstract: Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process
involving changes in magnification and movement between fields. Although recent
pathology foundation models are strong, practical agentic systems that decide
what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable
diagnoses are still lacking. The blocker is data: scalable, clinically aligned
supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not
written in textbooks or online, and therefore absent from large language model
training. We introduce the AI Session Recorder, which works with standard WSI
viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs
into standardized behavioral commands (inspect or peek at discrete
magnifications) and bounding boxes. A lightweight human-in-the-loop review
turns AI-drafted rationales into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired
"where to look" and "why it matters" supervision produced at roughly six times
lower labeling time. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathologist-o3, a
two-stage agent that first proposes regions of interest and then performs
behavior-guided reasoning. On gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection,
it achieved 84.5% precision, 100.0% recall, and 75.4% accuracy, exceeding the
state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our
knowledge, this constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems
in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated
supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a
path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征融合技术难以从异构冗余的多模态图像中提取结构和细节特征，需要引入频域学习来建模关键稀疏细节特征。

Method: 提出空间-光谱-频率交互网络(S²Fin)，包含高频稀疏增强Transformer、两级空间-频率融合策略（自适应频率通道模块和高频共振掩码）以及空间-光谱注意力融合模块。

Result: 在四个基准多模态数据集上的实验表明，S²Fin在有限标注数据下实现了优越的分类性能，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: S²Fin通过跨域融合有效提升了多模态遥感图像分类性能，证明了频域学习在特征提取中的重要性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant success in remote
sensing Earth observation data analysis. Numerous feature fusion techniques
address multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global
and local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract
structural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal
images. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and
sparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency
interaction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across
the spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a
high-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse
spatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency
filter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is
introduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses
low-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a
high-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity.
In addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances
feature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four
benchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that
S$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at https://github.com/HaoLiu-XDU/SSFin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在ForestEyes项目中，传统使用SLIC算法进行图像分割，但研究表明其他超像素方法在遥感图像分割中表现更优，可能更适合森林砍伐检测任务。

Method: 比较了四种最佳分割方法与SLIC算法，使用PyCaret AutoML库选择前五名分类器，并应用分类器融合（集成学习）方法。

Result: 初始结果显示各分割方法间性能差异不大，但通过分类器融合方法后，平衡准确率有明显提升。

Conclusion: 分割方法的选择和基于机器学习的模型组合对于森林砍伐检测任务都很重要，分类器融合能显著改善检测性能。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a crucial step in various visual applications,
including environmental monitoring through remote sensing. In the context of
the ForestEyes project, which combines citizen science and machine learning to
detect deforestation in tropical forests, image segments are used for labeling
by volunteers and subsequent model training. Traditionally, the Simple Linear
Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm is adopted as the segmentation method.
However, recent studies have indicated that other superpixel-based methods
outperform SLIC in remote sensing image segmentation, and might suggest that
they are more suitable for the task of detecting deforested areas. In this
sense, this study investigated the impact of the four best segmentation
methods, together with SLIC, on the training of classifiers for the target
application. Initially, the results showed little variation in performance
among segmentation methods, even when selecting the top five classifiers using
the PyCaret AutoML library. However, by applying a classifier fusion approach
(ensemble of classifiers), noticeable improvements in balanced accuracy were
observed, highlighting the importance of both the choice of segmentation method
and the combination of machine learning-based models for deforestation
detection tasks.

TL;DR: EduPersona是一个面向教育领域的大规模基准测试，专注于评估语言模型在课堂模拟中的主观能力，包含多语言、多学科、多人格类型的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育中的广泛应用，虚拟学生代理在课堂模拟和教师培训中变得重要，但其课堂导向的主观能力尚未得到充分评估，限制了模型边界理解和可信部署。

Method: 构建包含1,308个真实课堂对话轮次的大规模数据集，基于大五人格理论扩展至128k轮次，将主观性能分解为三个渐进任务：基本连贯性、学生真实性和长期人格一致性。

Result: 在三个代表性LLM上的实验显示，经过EduPersona微调的模型在所有任务上均有显著提升：TASK1 +33.6%、TASK2 +30.6%、TASK3 +14.9%。

Conclusion: EduPersona提供了首个专注于主观能力的课堂基准，建立了可解耦和可验证的研究范式，将开源数据集和框架以支持教育领域可信赖和类人AI的发展。

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly integrated into education, virtual
student agents are becoming vital for classroom simulation and teacher
training. Yet their classroom-oriented subjective abilities remain largely
unassessed, limiting understanding of model boundaries and hindering
trustworthy deployment. We present EduPersona, a large-scale benchmark spanning
two languages, three subjects, and ten persona types based on the Big Five
theory. The dataset contains 1,308 authentic classroom dialogue rounds,
corresponding to 12,814 teacher-student Q&A turns, and is further expanded
through persona stylization into roughly 10 times larger scale (128k turns),
providing a solid foundation for evaluation. Building on this resource, we
decompose hard-to-quantify subjective performance into three progressive tasks:
TASK1 basic coherence (whether behavior, emotion, expression, and voice align
with classroom context), TASK2 student realism, and TASK3 long-term persona
consistency, thereby establishing an evaluation framework grounded in
educational theory and research value. We conduct systematic experiments on
three representative LLMs, comparing their original versions with ten
persona-fine-tuned variants trained on EduPersona. Results show consistent and
significant average improvements across all tasks: TASK1 +33.6%, TASK2 +30.6%,
and TASK3 +14.9%. These improvements highlight the dataset's effectiveness and
research value, while also revealing the heterogeneous difficulty of persona
modeling. In summary, EduPersona delivers the first classroom benchmark
centered on subjective abilities, establishes a decoupled and verifiable
research paradigm, and we will open-source both the dataset and the framework
to support the broader research community in advancing trustworthy and
human-like AI for education.

Motivation: 步态包含丰富的生物特征和行为信息，但利用行走方式来推断心理特征仍然是一个具有挑战性且未被充分探索的问题。

Method: 使用分层多阶段运动专家混合架构，在四个运动复杂度阶段处理行走周期，采用轻量级专家模型提取时空特征，并使用任务特定的门控模块自适应加权不同特征和阶段。

Conclusion: 多任务步态学习对于心理特征估计是可行的，为未来基于运动信息的心理推断研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Gait encodes rich biometric and behavioural information, yet leveraging the
manner of walking to infer psychological traits remains a challenging and
underexplored problem. We introduce a hierarchical Multi-Stage Mixture of
Movement Experts (MoME) architecture for multi-task prediction of psychological
attributes from gait sequences represented as 2D poses. MoME processes the
walking cycle in four stages of movement complexity, employing lightweight
expert models to extract spatio-temporal features and task-specific gating
modules to adaptively weight experts across traits and stages. Evaluated on the
PsyMo benchmark covering 17 psychological traits, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art gait analysis models, achieving a 37.47% weighted F1 score at
the run level and 44.6% at the subject level. Our experiments show that
integrating auxiliary tasks such as identity recognition, gender prediction,
and BMI estimation further improves psychological trait estimation. Our
findings demonstrate the viability of multi-task gait-based learning for
psychological trait estimation and provide a foundation for future research on
movement-informed psychological inference.

Abstract: In recent years, multi-concept personalization for text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models to represent several subjects in an image has gained much more
attention. The main challenge of this task is "concept mixing", where multiple
learned concepts interfere or blend undesirably in the output image. To address
this issue, in this paper, we present ConceptSplit, a novel framework to split
the individual concepts through training and inference. Our framework comprises
two key components. First, we introduce Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA), a
merging-free training method that focuses exclusively on adapting the value
projection in cross-attention. Based on our empirical analysis, we found that
modifying the key projection, a common approach in existing methods, can
disrupt the attention mechanism and lead to concept mixing. Second, we propose
Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA), which alleviates
attention entanglement during inference by optimizing the input latent. Through
extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that
ConceptSplit achieves robust multi-concept personalization, mitigating
unintended concept interference. Code is available at

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation in multi-phase MRI is vital for liver fibrosis
assessment, yet labeled data is often scarce and unevenly distributed across
imaging modalities and vendor systems. We propose a label-efficient
segmentation approach that promotes cross-modality generalization under
real-world conditions, where GED4 hepatobiliary-phase annotations are limited,
non-contrast sequences (T1WI, T2WI, DWI) are unlabeled, and spatial
misalignment and missing phases are common. Our method integrates a
foundation-scale 3D segmentation backbone adapted via fine-tuning, co-training
with cross pseudo supervision to leverage unlabeled volumes, and a standardized
preprocessing pipeline. Without requiring spatial registration, the model
learns to generalize across MRI phases and vendors, demonstrating robust
segmentation performance in both labeled and unlabeled domains. Our results
exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed label-efficient baseline for liver
segmentation in multi-phase, multi-vendor MRI and highlight the potential of
combining foundation model adaptation with co-training for real-world clinical
imaging tasks.

Abstract: Human-centric generative models designed for AI-driven storytelling must
bring together two core capabilities: identity consistency and precise control
over human performance. While recent diffusion-based approaches have made
significant progress in maintaining facial identity, achieving fine-grained
expression control without compromising identity remains challenging. In this
work, we present a diffusion-based framework that faithfully reimagines any
subject under any particular facial expression. Building on an ID-consistent
face foundation model, we adopt a compositional design featuring an expression
cross-attention module guided by FLAME blendshape parameters for explicit
control. Trained on a diverse mixture of image and video data rich in
expressive variation, our adapter generalizes beyond basic emotions to subtle
micro-expressions and expressive transitions, overlooked by prior works. In
addition, a pluggable Reference Adapter enables expression editing in real
images by transferring the appearance from a reference frame during synthesis.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model
outperforms existing methods in tailored and identity-consistent expression
generation. Code and models can be found at

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Graph Prediction aims to detect objects and their semantic
relationships in 3D scenes, and has emerged as a crucial technology for
robotics and AR/VR applications. While previous research has addressed dataset
limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings,
they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and
relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks
despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate
through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical
role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we
design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive
pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the
scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification
accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction.
Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we
observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics.
Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the
integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric
and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction.
Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/OCRL-3DSSG-Codes.

TL;DR: 首个野生动物监测单目深度估计基准测试，评估4种先进MDE方法在93张相机陷阱图像上的表现，发现Depth Anything V2性能最佳（MAE 0.454m），中值深度提取优于均值方法。


<details>

Motivation: 相机陷阱广泛用于野生动物监测，但单目图像缺乏深度信息，现有MDE方法在自然野生动物环境中的性能尚未系统评估。

Method: 使用校准的ChARUCO模式获取真实距离，评估4种先进MDE方法（Depth Anything V2、ML Depth Pro、ZoeDepth、Metric3D）和几何基线方法在93张相机陷阱图像上的表现。

Result: Depth Anything V2表现最佳（MAE 0.454m，相关性0.962），ZoeDepth在户外自然环境中性能显著下降（MAE 3.087m），中值深度提取在所有深度学习方法中均优于均值方法。

Conclusion: 建立了野生动物应用性能基准，为保护监测系统中实施深度估计提供实用指导，Depth Anything V2在准确性和速度间达到最佳平衡。

Abstract: Camera traps are widely used for wildlife monitoring, but extracting accurate
distance measurements from monocular images remains challenging due to the lack
of depth information. While monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods have
advanced significantly, their performance in natural wildlife environments has
not been systematically evaluated. This work introduces the first benchmark for
monocular metric depth estimation in wildlife monitoring conditions. We
evaluate four state-of-the-art MDE methods (Depth Anything V2, ML Depth Pro,
ZoeDepth, and Metric3D) alongside a geometric baseline on 93 camera trap images
with ground truth distances obtained using calibrated ChARUCO patterns. Our
results demonstrate that Depth Anything V2 achieves the best overall
performance with a mean absolute error of 0.454m and correlation of 0.962,
while methods like ZoeDepth show significant degradation in outdoor natural
environments (MAE: 3.087m). We find that median-based depth extraction
consistently outperforms mean-based approaches across all deep learning
methods. Additionally, we analyze computational efficiency, with ZoeDepth being
fastest (0.17s per image) but least accurate, while Depth Anything V2 provides
an optimal balance of accuracy and speed (0.22s per image). This benchmark
establishes performance baselines for wildlife applications and provides
practical guidance for implementing depth estimation in conservation monitoring
systems.

Result: 在多个IRSTD基准测试中取得有竞争力的性能，在有限训练数据、噪声和领域偏移场景下表现出色，可应用于各种YOLO骨干网络。

Conclusion: AA-YOLO是资源受限实际部署中具有吸引力的解决方案，具有高泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) is a challenging task in defense
applications, where complex backgrounds and tiny target sizes often result in
numerous false alarms using conventional object detectors. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Anomaly-Aware YOLO (AA-YOLO), which integrates a
statistical anomaly detection test into its detection head. By treating small
targets as unexpected patterns against the background, AA-YOLO effectively
controls the false alarm rate. Our approach not only achieves competitive
performance on several IRSTD benchmarks, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness in scenarios with limited training data, noise, and domain shifts.
Furthermore, since only the detection head is modified, our design is highly
generic and has been successfully applied across various YOLO backbones,
including lightweight models. It also provides promising results when
integrated into an instance segmentation YOLO. This versatility makes AA-YOLO
an attractive solution for real-world deployments where resources are
constrained. The code will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索transformer架构在自然对话场景中的人员识别能力，特别是在面对面互动环境下如何有效利用姿态和动态信息进行身份识别。

Method: 采用双流框架：空间transformer建模133个COCO WholeBody关键点的空间配置，多尺度时间transformer建模层次化运动模式。比较了预训练与从头训练，并研究了速度特征的使用。

Result: 领域特定训练显著优于迁移学习；空间配置比时间动态更具判别性；空间transformer准确率95.74%，多尺度时间transformer准确率93.90%；特征级融合将性能提升至98.03%。

Conclusion: transformer架构在自然互动中的人员识别具有巨大潜力，姿态和动态信息具有互补性，为未来多模态和跨文化研究提供了见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of transformer-based architectures
for person identification in natural, face-to-face conversation scenario. We
implement and evaluate a two-stream framework that separately models spatial
configurations and temporal motion patterns of 133 COCO WholeBody keypoints,
extracted from a subset of the CANDOR conversational corpus. Our experiments
compare pre-trained and from-scratch training, investigate the use of velocity
features, and introduce a multi-scale temporal transformer for hierarchical
motion modeling. Results demonstrate that domain-specific training
significantly outperforms transfer learning, and that spatial configurations
carry more discriminative information than temporal dynamics. The spatial
transformer achieves 95.74% accuracy, while the multi-scale temporal
transformer achieves 93.90%. Feature-level fusion pushes performance to 98.03%,
confirming that postural and dynamic information are complementary. These
findings highlight the potential of transformer architectures for person
identification in natural interactions and provide insights for future
multimodal and cross-cultural studies.

TL;DR: PG-Occ是一个渐进式高斯变换器框架，用于开放词汇的3D占用预测，通过渐进式在线密集化和各向异性感知采样策略，在保持计算效率的同时提升对小物体的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D占用预测方法受限于固定语义类别，而现有文本对齐方法存在稀疏表示无法捕捉小物体与密集表示计算开销大的权衡问题。

Method: 采用渐进式在线密集化策略逐步增强3D高斯表示，结合各向异性感知采样和时空融合，自适应分配不同尺度和阶段的感受野。

Result: 在评估中实现了最先进的性能，相比之前最佳方法相对提升了14.3%的mIoU。

Conclusion: PG-Occ框架有效解决了文本对齐场景建模中的权衡问题，实现了更精确和详细的场景理解。

Abstract: The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent
years, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While
traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches
have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary
text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in
text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to
capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs
significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present
PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables
open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive
online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D
Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively
enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and
detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of
an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which
adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and
stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene
information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ
achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement
over the previous best performing method. Code and pretrained models will be
released upon publication on our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用已见类数据估计开放环境分布，但由于未见类的缺失导致估计误差无法识别。需要超越已见类的学习来约束估计误差

Method: 1. 类域数据生成管道：在层次语义树和从已见类数据推断的域信息指导下生成未见类数据；2. 分布对齐算法：估计并最大化后验概率以增强泛化能力

Result: 在11个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法比基线方法性能提升高达14%

Conclusion: 通过生成未见类数据可以有效估计开放环境中的分布，理论证明估计误差存在上界，实验验证了方法的有效性和优越性

Abstract: Open-vocabulary learning requires modeling the data distribution in open
environments, which consists of both seen-class and unseen-class data.
  Existing methods estimate the distribution in open environments using
seen-class data, where the absence of unseen classes makes the estimation error
inherently unidentifiable.
  Intuitively, learning beyond the seen classes is crucial for distribution
estimation to bound the estimation error.
  We theoretically demonstrate that the distribution can be effectively
estimated by generating unseen-class data, through which the estimation error
is upper-bounded.
  Building on this theoretical insight, we propose a novel open-vocabulary
learning method, which generates unseen-class data for estimating the
distribution in open environments. The method consists of a class-domain-wise
data generation pipeline and a distribution alignment algorithm. The data
generation pipeline generates unseen-class data under the guidance of a
hierarchical semantic tree and domain information inferred from the seen-class
data, facilitating accurate distribution estimation. With the generated data,
the distribution alignment algorithm estimates and maximizes the posterior
probability to enhance generalization in open-vocabulary learning. Extensive
experiments on $11$ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline
approaches by up to $14\%$, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

TL;DR: FedSurg挑战赛评估了联邦学习在手术视频分类中的应用，重点关注模型对未见临床中心的泛化能力和本地微调后的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立联邦学习在手术视频分类中的基准，评估现有方法在保护患者数据隐私的同时，对未见临床中心的泛化能力和本地适应性。

Method: 使用多中心Appendix300视频数据集，参与者开发了基础模型线性探测、度量学习、各种FL聚合方案等方法，评估泛化和适应任务。

Result: 泛化任务中跨中心性能有限，适应任务中所有团队在微调后都有改善但排名稳定性低，ViViT模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该挑战赛建立了手术视频分类中FL策略的首个基准，揭示了本地个性化与全局鲁棒性之间的权衡，强调了架构选择、预处理和损失设计的重要性。

Abstract: Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art
in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess
how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt
through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development
without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to
classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the
multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks:
generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after
fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear
probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes
(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and
Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and
statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across
centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after
fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission
achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted
limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties
in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal
modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies.
Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for
evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight
the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and
underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss
design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of
imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

Method: 使用两个协调工作的机器人系统：一个配备扫描仪，另一个处理托盘。通过参数化扫描空间、优化轨迹规划和路径点分布，确保全面表面覆盖并最小化遮挡。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法相比基线方法显著降低了Chamfer距离，提高了F-score，在几何精度和数字化效率方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该系统能够提供卓越的几何精度、改进的数字化效率，并减少对专家操作人员的依赖，为文化遗产保护提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D scanning is essential for preserving cultural heritage
artefacts, supporting documentation, analysis, and long-term conservation.
However, conventional methods typically require specialized expertise and
manual intervention to maintain optimal scanning conditions and coverage. We
present an automated two-robot scanning system that eliminates the need for
handheld or semi-automatic workflows by combining coordinated robotic
manipulation with high-resolution 3D scanning. Our system parameterizes the
scanning space into distinct regions, enabling coordinated motion planning
between a scanner-equipped robot and a tray-handling robot. Optimized
trajectory planning and waypoint distribution ensure comprehensive surface
coverage, minimize occlusions, and balance reconstruction accuracy with system
efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly
lower Chamfer Distance and higher F-score compared to baseline methods,
offering superior geometric accuracy, improved digitization efficiency, and
reduced reliance on expert operators.

TL;DR: 该研究系统比较了ViT和CNN在几何估计任务中的表现，发现在大数据场景下ViT优于CNN，但在小数据场景下CNN由于归纳偏置和较小容量表现更好，ViT在跨域评估中泛化能力更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ViT和CNN作为骨干网络在几何估计任务（如图像刚性变换和基础矩阵估计）中的效率，特别是在低数据量场景下的表现。

Method: 系统比较大规模CNN（ResNet、EfficientNet、CLIP-ResNet）与基于ViT的基础模型（CLIP-ViT变体和DINO）在不同数据量设置下的表现，包括少样本场景。

Result: 在大数据下游场景中，ViT在精调时优于CNN；在小数据场景中，CNN的归纳偏置和较小容量使其表现与ViT相当；ViT在跨域评估中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 需要根据具体任务和数据量仔细选择模型架构进行精调，未来研究应关注平衡局部和全局表示的混合架构。

Abstract: Vision-transformers (ViTs) and large-scale convolution-neural-networks (CNNs)
have reshaped computer vision through pretrained feature representations that
enable strong transfer learning for diverse tasks. However, their efficiency as
backbone architectures for geometric estimation tasks involving image
deformations in low-data regimes remains an open question. This work considers
two such tasks: 1) estimating 2D rigid transformations between pairs of images
and 2) predicting the fundamental matrix for stereo image pairs, an important
problem in various applications, such as autonomous mobility, robotics, and 3D
scene reconstruction. Addressing this intriguing question, this work
systematically compares large-scale CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP-ResNet)
with ViT-based foundation models (CLIP-ViT variants and DINO) in various data
size settings, including few-shot scenarios. These pretrained models are
optimized for classification or contrastive learning, encouraging them to focus
mostly on high-level semantics. The considered tasks require balancing local
and global features differently, challenging the straightforward adoption of
these models as the backbone. Empirical comparative analysis shows that,
similar to training from scratch, ViTs outperform CNNs during refinement in
large downstream-data scenarios. However, in small data scenarios, the
inductive bias and smaller capacity of CNNs improve their performance, allowing
them to match that of a ViT. Moreover, ViTs exhibit stronger generalization in
cross-domain evaluation where the data distribution changes. These results
emphasize the importance of carefully selecting model architectures for
refinement, motivating future research towards hybrid architectures that
balance local and global representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿模型在细节保持、真实图像鲁棒性、高效采样、图像编辑能力和跨品类泛化方面存在挑战，需要更强大的解决方案。

Method: 利用扩散变换器(DiT)进行图像条件虚拟试穿，探索多种配置(上下文标记拼接、通道拼接、ControlNet集成)，在包含多样化背景和非服装类别的扩展数据集上训练。

Result: 在VITON-HD数据集上超越最先进方法，实现更好的细节保持和鲁棒性，同时在数千个产品类别的多样化数据集上优于具有VTA和图像编辑能力的模型。

Conclusion: DiT-VTON重新定义了虚拟试穿任务，提供了通用的虚拟试穿解决方案，支持多种产品类别和高级图像编辑功能，展示了数据扩展对VTO适应性的益处。

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified the demand for Virtual Try-On
(VTO) technologies, enabling customers to realistically visualize products
overlaid on their own images. Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face
challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world
imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization
across diverse product categories. In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel
VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its
performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the
image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT
configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel
concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO
image conditioning.
  To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing
varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories,
demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also
redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual
Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories
and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose
preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level
customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation
and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also
outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset
spanning thousands of product categories.

TL;DR: EgoSurg是一个从固定摄像头视频重建手术室中任何人员动态第一人称视角回放的框架，无需干扰临床工作流程，通过几何驱动的神经渲染和扩散模型增强视图，实现高保真度的任意视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手术观察依赖固定视角或回忆，无法记录指导临床决策的第一人称视觉视角。固定摄像头视频只能捕捉房间尺度的工作流程，但无法重建每个团队成员实际看到的内容，限制了手术安全、培训和流程优化的决策分析。

Method: EgoSurg结合几何驱动的神经渲染与基于扩散的视图增强，能够从墙装固定摄像头视频中合成任意时刻的任意第一人称视角，实现高视觉保真度的动态回放。

Result: 在多站点手术案例和对照研究的评估中，EgoSurg能够以高视觉质量和保真度重建人员特定的视觉场和任意视角。

Conclusion: 通过将现有手术室摄像头基础设施转变为可导航的动态3D记录，EgoSurg为沉浸式手术数据科学建立了新基础，使手术实践可以从每个角度进行可视化、体验和分析。

Abstract: Observing surgical practice has historically relied on fixed vantage points
or recollections, leaving the egocentric visual perspectives that guide
clinical decisions undocumented. Fixed-camera video can capture surgical
workflows at the room-scale, but cannot reconstruct what each team member
actually saw. Thus, these videos only provide limited insights into how
decisions that affect surgical safety, training, and workflow optimization are
made. Here we introduce EgoSurg, the first framework to reconstruct the
dynamic, egocentric replays for any operating room (OR) staff directly from
wall-mounted fixed-camera video, and thus, without intervention to clinical
workflow. EgoSurg couples geometry-driven neural rendering with diffusion-based
view enhancement, enabling high-visual fidelity synthesis of arbitrary and
egocentric viewpoints at any moment. In evaluation across multi-site surgical
cases and controlled studies, EgoSurg reconstructs person-specific visual
fields and arbitrary viewpoints with high visual quality and fidelity. By
transforming existing OR camera infrastructure into a navigable dynamic 3D
record, EgoSurg establishes a new foundation for immersive surgical data
science, enabling surgical practice to be visualized, experienced, and analyzed
from every angle.

Motivation: 理解为什么多模态语言模型在感知密集型任务上表现不佳，特别是研究视觉键值令牌在语言模型中的处理机制。

Method: 分析流行多模态语言模型（LLaVA-OneVision、Qwen2.5-VL、Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT）中视觉键值令牌的信息流动，包括零样本任务测试、视觉信息编码分析以及控制实验。

Result: 发现图像值令牌编码了足够的视觉信息来执行感知任务，但语言模型对视觉信息的处理存在缺陷；添加文本前缀可以改善感知能力；在BLINK基准测试中，33.3%的艺术风格问题中语言模型内部的感知信息未能输出。

Conclusion: 多模态语言模型的感知能力受限于语言模型对视觉信息的控制能力，改进视觉编码器和语言模型组件的训练方法可能提升整体性能。

Abstract: Despite interpretability work analyzing VIT encoders and transformer
activations, we don't yet understand why Multimodal Language Models (MLMs)
struggle on perception-heavy tasks. We offer an under-studied perspective by
examining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and
Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the
flow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value
tokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks
zero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and
referring expression detection. We find that while the language model does
augment the visual information received from the projection of input visual
encodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it
contains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual
encoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that
the visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in
later layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception
capability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information
in the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input
improves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal
that if language models were able to better control their visual information,
their perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style
questions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the
language model is not surfaced to the output! Our findings reveal insights into
the role of key-value tokens in multimodal systems, paving the way for deeper
mechanistic interpretability of MLMs and suggesting new directions for training
their visual encoder and language model components.

Conclusion: AvatarVTON能够生成高质量的4D虚拟试穿效果，适用于AR/VR、游戏和数字人应用，是首个支持单视角动态服装交互的框架。

Abstract: We propose AvatarVTON, the first 4D virtual try-on framework that generates
realistic try-on results from a single in-shop garment image, enabling free
pose control, novel-view rendering, and diverse garment choices. Unlike
existing methods, AvatarVTON supports dynamic garment interactions under
single-view supervision, without relying on multi-view garment captures or
physics priors. The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Reciprocal
Flow Rectifier, a prior-free optical-flow correction strategy that stabilizes
avatar fitting and ensures temporal coherence; and (2) a Non-Linear Deformer,
which decomposes Gaussian maps into view-pose-invariant and view-pose-specific
components, enabling adaptive, non-linear garment deformations. To establish a
benchmark for 4D virtual try-on, we extend existing baselines with unified
modules for fair qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Extensive
experiments show that AvatarVTON achieves high fidelity, diversity, and dynamic
garment realism, making it well-suited for AR/VR, gaming, and digital-human
applications.

Abstract: Generating synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI or CBCT plays a crucial role in
enabling MRI-only and CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy, improving treatment
precision while reducing patient radiation exposure. To address this task, we
adopt a fully 3D Flow Matching (FM) framework, motivated by recent work
demonstrating FM's efficiency in producing high-quality images. In our
approach, a Gaussian noise volume is transformed into an sCT image by
integrating a learned FM velocity field, conditioned on features extracted from
the input MRI or CBCT using a lightweight 3D encoder. We evaluated the method
on the SynthRAD2025 Challenge benchmark, training separate models for MRI
$\rightarrow$ sCT and CBCT $\rightarrow$ sCT across three anatomical regions:
abdomen, head and neck, and thorax. Validation and testing were performed
through the challenge submission system. The results indicate that the method
accurately reconstructs global anatomical structures; however, preservation of
fine details was limited, primarily due to the relatively low training
resolution imposed by memory and runtime constraints. Future work will explore
patch-based training and latent-space flow models to improve resolution and
local structural fidelity.

TL;DR: 提出AT-BPTT框架，通过动态调整截断位置和窗口大小来改进数据集蒸馏中的内循环优化，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率和内存利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法中的内循环优化通常依赖随机截断策略，缺乏灵活性且效果欠佳。研究发现神经网络在不同训练阶段具有不同的学习动态，随机截断效果不佳。

Method: AT-BPTT框架包含三个关键组件：(1)基于概率的阶段感知时间步选择机制；(2)基于梯度变化的自适应窗口大小策略；(3)低秩Hessian近似以减少计算开销。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet和ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，AT-BPTT平均准确率比基线方法提高6.16%，内循环优化加速3.9倍，节省63%内存成本。

Conclusion: AT-BPTT通过动态适应梯度行为实现了更高效的数据集蒸馏，在性能和效率方面均达到最先进水平。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient deep learning has positioned dataset
distillation as a pivotal technique for compressing training dataset while
preserving model performance. However, existing inner-loop optimization methods
for dataset distillation typically rely on random truncation strategies, which
lack flexibility and often yield suboptimal results. In this work, we observe
that neural networks exhibit distinct learning dynamics across different
training stages-early, middle, and late-making random truncation ineffective.
To address this limitation, we propose Automatic Truncated Backpropagation
Through Time (AT-BPTT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts both
truncation positions and window sizes according to intrinsic gradient behavior.
AT-BPTT introduces three key components: (1) a probabilistic mechanism for
stage-aware timestep selection, (2) an adaptive window sizing strategy based on
gradient variation, and (3) a low-rank Hessian approximation to reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that AT-BPTT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving accuracy by an average of 6.16% over baseline methods.
Moreover, our approach accelerates inner-loop optimization by 3.9x while saving
63% memory cost.

Abstract: An accurate and up-to-date model of a photovoltaic (PV) power plant is
essential for its optimal operation and maintenance. However, such a model may
not be easily available. This work introduces a novel approach for PV power
plant mapping based on aerial overview images. It enables the automation of the
mapping process while removing the reliance on third-party data. The presented
mapping method takes advantage of the structural layout of the power plants to
achieve detailed modeling down to the level of individual PV modules. The
approach relies on visual segmentation of PV modules in overview images and the
inference of structural information in each image, assigning modules to
individual benches, rows, and columns. We identify visual keypoints related to
the layout and use these to merge detections from multiple images while
maintaining their structural integrity. The presented method was experimentally
verified and evaluated on two different power plants. The final fusion of 3D
positions and semantic structures results in a compact georeferenced model
suitable for power plant maintenance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D骨架数据的运动学识别框架，通过结合时空图卷积网络和卷积神经网络，无需手动定义物理动作与心理类别的映射关系，即可推断人类活动的交流功能。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic relationship between humans and the built
environment is a key challenge in disciplines ranging from environmental
psychology to reinforcement learning (RL). A central obstacle in modeling these
interactions is the inability to capture human psychological states in a way
that is both generalizable and privacy preserving. Traditional methods rely on
theoretical models or questionnaires, which are limited in scope, static, and
labor intensive. We present a kinesics recognition framework that infers the
communicative functions of human activity -- known as kinesics -- directly from
3D skeleton joint data. Combining a spatial-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the framework
leverages transfer learning to bypass the need for manually defined mappings
between physical actions and psychological categories. The approach preserves
user anonymity while uncovering latent structures in bodily movements that
reflect cognitive and emotional states. Our results on the Dyadic User
EngagemenT (DUET) dataset demonstrate that this method enables scalable,
accurate, and human-centered modeling of behavior, offering a new pathway for
enhancing RL-driven simulations of human-environment interaction.

Motivation: 传统网络物理系统主要关注经济目标，忽视了社会效益。网络物理社会基础设施系统旨在通过定义社会效益、理解人类互动等方式来弥补这一缺陷。

Method: 使用深度传感器分析骨骼运动，比较了五种基于骨骼的交互识别算法，在包含12种二元互动的数据集上进行评估。

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate sensing, computing, and control to
improve infrastructure performance, focusing on economic goals like performance
and safety. However, they often neglect potential human-centered (or
''social'') benefits. Cyber-physical-social infrastructure systems (CPSIS) aim
to address this by aligning CPS with social objectives. This involves defining
social benefits, understanding human interactions with each other and
infrastructure, developing privacy-preserving measurement methods, modeling
these interactions for prediction, linking them to social benefits, and
actuating the physical environment to foster positive social outcomes. This
paper delves into recognizing dyadic human interactions using real-world data,
which is the backbone to measuring social behavior. This lays a foundation to
address the need to enhance understanding of the deeper meanings and mutual
responses inherent in human interactions. While RGB cameras are informative for
interaction recognition, privacy concerns arise. Depth sensors offer a
privacy-conscious alternative by analyzing skeletal movements. This study
compares five skeleton-based interaction recognition algorithms on a dataset of
12 dyadic interactions. Unlike single-person datasets, these interactions,
categorized into communication types like emblems and affect displays, offer
insights into the cultural and emotional aspects of human interactions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合早期退出和知识蒸馏的方法，通过引入新的基于熵的损失函数来训练学生模型，在保持分类性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>

Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类中表现出色，但计算成本高，限制了在实时和边缘应用中的实用性。需要开发压缩技术来降低计算成本，同时动态架构可以在执行时调节压缩级别。

Method: 整合早期退出和知识蒸馏两种优化技术，使用更复杂的教师早期退出模型训练简化的学生早期退出模型。关键创新是引入新的基于熵的损失函数来处理教师分类错误的图像。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100和SVHN数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在保持分类性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效优化了准确性和效率之间的权衡，为知识蒸馏在其他场景中的应用开辟了新的研究视角。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification with
relatively high efficiency, they still exhibit high computational costs, often
rendering them impractical for real-time and edge applications. Therefore, a
multitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs
while maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been
introduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a
desirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed
method effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques:
early exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit
model is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary
contribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student
early-exit model. In comparison to the conventional Knowledge Distillation
loss, our approach incorporates a new entropy-based loss for images where the
teacher's classification was incorrect. The proposed method optimizes the
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving significant
reductions in computational complexity without compromising classification
performance. The validity of this approach is substantiated by experimental
results on image classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN, which
further opens new research perspectives for Knowledge Distillation in other
contexts.

Conclusion: 光学显微镜研究可以从深度学习模型的泛化能力中受益，特别是在处理异常值、评估小图像块和实现快速预测方面。

Abstract: Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research
studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable
experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples
and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct
processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with
variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward
implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when
evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for
well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal
domain.
  To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based
IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability
and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by
previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for
IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same
architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores
for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable
predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside
the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA
provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize
spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that
optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep
learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers,
the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end, IoT-enabled robotic system for the
non-destructive, real-time, and spatially-resolved mapping of grape yield and
quality (Brix, Acidity) in vineyards. The system features a comprehensive
analytical pipeline that integrates two key modules: a high-performance model
for grape bunch detection and weight estimation, and a novel deep learning
framework for quality assessment from hyperspectral (HSI) data. A critical
barrier to in-field HSI is the ``domain shift" caused by variable illumination.
To overcome this, our quality assessment is powered by the Light-Invariant
Spectral Autoencoder (LISA), a domain-adversarial framework that learns
illumination-invariant features from uncalibrated data. We validated the
system's robustness on a purpose-built HSI dataset spanning three distinct
illumination domains: controlled artificial lighting (lab), and variable
natural sunlight captured in the morning and afternoon. Results show the
complete pipeline achieves a recall (0.82) for bunch detection and a $R^2$
(0.76) for weight prediction, while the LISA module improves quality prediction
generalization by over 20% compared to the baselines. By combining these robust
modules, the system successfully generates high-resolution, georeferenced data
of both grape yield and quality, providing actionable, data-driven insights for
precision viticulture.

Abstract: Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems,
guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management.
Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a
thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS)
tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by
bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted
surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000}
of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable
supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data,
together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and
algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for
AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles,
facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying
open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance
accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a
standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements
in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

Conclusion: SAHC方法能够有效利用层次分类任务的固有结构，在遥感图像分类任务中展现出良好的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has become increasingly important in remote sensing image
classification due to its ability to extract semantic information from complex
data. Classification tasks often include predefined label hierarchies that
represent the semantic relationships among classes. However, these hierarchies
are frequently overlooked, and most approaches focus only on fine-grained
classification schemes. In this paper, we present a novel Semantics-Aware
Hierarchical Consensus (SAHC) method for learning hierarchical features and
relationships by integrating hierarchy-specific classification heads within a
deep network architecture, each specialized in different degrees of class
granularity. The proposed approach employs trainable hierarchy matrices, which
guide the network through the learning of the hierarchical structure in a
self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical consensus
mechanism to ensure consistent probability distributions across different
hierarchical levels. This mechanism acts as a weighted ensemble being able to
effectively leverage the inherent structure of the hierarchical classification
task. The proposed SAHC method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with
different degrees of hierarchical complexity on different tasks, using distinct
backbone architectures to effectively emphasize its adaptability. Experimental
results show both the effectiveness of the proposed approach in guiding network
learning and the robustness of the hierarchical consensus for remote sensing
image classification tasks.

Conclusion: REN展示了强大的泛化能力和临床可解释性，为结构化医学成像应用提供了可扩展的解剖学引导方法。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have significantly contributed to
scalable machine learning by enabling specialized subnetworks to tackle complex
tasks efficiently. However, traditional MoE systems lack domain-specific
constraints essential for medical imaging, where anatomical structure and
regional disease heterogeneity strongly influence pathological patterns. Here,
we introduce Regional Expert Networks (REN), the first anatomically-informed
MoE framework tailored specifically for medical image classification. REN
leverages anatomical priors to train seven specialized experts, each dedicated
to distinct lung lobes and bilateral lung combinations, enabling precise
modeling of region-specific pathological variations. Multi-modal gating
mechanisms dynamically integrate radiomics biomarkers and deep learning (DL)
features (CNN, ViT, Mamba) to weight expert contributions optimally. Applied to
interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, REN achieves consistently
superior performance: the radiomics-guided ensemble reached an average AUC of
0.8646 +/- 0.0467, a +12.5 percent improvement over the SwinUNETR baseline (AUC
0.7685, p = 0.031). Region-specific experts further revealed that lower-lobe
models achieved AUCs of 0.88-0.90, surpassing DL counterparts (CNN: 0.76-0.79)
and aligning with known disease progression patterns. Through rigorous
patient-level cross-validation, REN demonstrates strong generalizability and
clinical interpretability, presenting a scalable, anatomically-guided approach
readily extensible to other structured medical imaging applications.

Motivation: 传统主动学习需要大量人工标注，而无监督主动学习(UAL)方法性能不足，主要依赖局部梯度评分，易受噪声影响且无法充分代表数据分布

Method: 使用特定特征学习机器(SFLM)量化样本对模型性能的贡献，并定义重构差异度量进行初始样本选择

Result: NFPF显著超越现有UAL方法，在视觉数据集上达到与监督主动学习相当的性能，具有更好的鲁棒性和数据分布覆盖

Conclusion: NFPF通过创新的样本重要性度量方法，为无监督主动学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The effectiveness of modern deep learning models is predicated on the
availability of large-scale, human-annotated datasets, a process that is
notoriously expensive and time-consuming. While Active Learning (AL) offers a
strategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative
data, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement.
Unsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the
annotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing
UAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches
typically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance
estimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data
but also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the
full data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear
selection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the
Natural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes
how sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature
Learning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to
model performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful
Reconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our
comprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all
established UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL
methods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative
visualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance,
enhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CA3D-Diff是一个基于条件扩散模型的双向乳腺X光片视图转换框架，通过列感知交叉注意力和隐式3D结构重建来解决乳腺X光片中视图间结构不对齐的挑战。

Abstract: Dual-view mammography, including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique
(MLO) projections, offers complementary anatomical views crucial for breast
cancer diagnosis. However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be
missing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression
artifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view
translation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike
natural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large
non-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which
obscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and
Implicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view
translation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address
cross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware
cross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that
anatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions
across views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise
correlations while suppressing distant mismatches. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit 3D structure reconstruction module that back-projects noisy 2D latents
into a coarse 3D feature volume based on breast-view projection geometry. The
reconstructed 3D structure is refined and injected into the denoising UNet to
guide cross-view generation with enhanced anatomical awareness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CA3D-Diff achieves superior performance in
bidirectional tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity
and structural consistency. Furthermore, the synthesized views effectively
improve single-view malignancy classification in screening settings,
demonstrating the practical value of our method in real-world diagnostics.

Motivation: 当前基于KL-VAE的tokenizer需要对抗损失，而扩散解码器虽然更原理化但需要迭代采样导致解码时间较长。需要一种既能保持高质量又具备高效性的解码器。

Method: 提出新的像素扩散解码器架构，利用transformer组件和无GAN训练提高扩展性和训练稳定性，并通过蒸馏技术将扩散解码器性能复制到高效的单步解码器中。

Result: SSDD将重建FID从0.87提升到0.50，吞吐量提高1.4倍，在DiTs中保持生成质量的同时采样速度加快3.8倍。

Conclusion: SSDD可以作为KL-VAE的直接替代品，用于构建更高质量和更快的生成模型。

Abstract: Tokenizers are a key component of state-of-the-art generative image models,
extracting the most important features from the signal while reducing data
dimension and redundancy. Most current tokenizers are based on KL-regularized
variational autoencoders (KL-VAE), trained with reconstruction, perceptual and
adversarial losses. Diffusion decoders have been proposed as a more principled
alternative to model the distribution over images conditioned on the latent.
However, matching the performance of KL-VAE still requires adversarial losses,
as well as a higher decoding time due to iterative sampling. To address these
limitations, we introduce a new pixel diffusion decoder architecture for
improved scaling and training stability, benefiting from transformer components
and GAN-free training. We use distillation to replicate the performance of the
diffusion decoder in an efficient single-step decoder. This makes SSDD the
first diffusion decoder optimized for single-step reconstruction trained
without adversarial losses, reaching higher reconstruction quality and faster
sampling than KL-VAE. In particular, SSDD improves reconstruction FID from
$0.87$ to $0.50$ with $1.4\times$ higher throughput and preserve generation
quality of DiTs with $3.8\times$ faster sampling. As such, SSDD can be used as
a drop-in replacement for KL-VAE, and for building higher-quality and faster
generative models.

Abstract: Being trained on large and vast datasets, visual foundation models (VFMs) can
be fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks, achieving remarkable performance
and efficiency in various computer vision applications. The high computation
cost of data collection and training motivates the owners of some VFMs to
distribute them alongside the license to protect their intellectual property
rights. However, a dishonest user of the protected model's copy may illegally
redistribute it, for example, to make a profit. As a consequence, the
development of reliable ownership verification tools is of great importance
today, since such methods can be used to differentiate between a redistributed
copy of the protected model and an independent model. In this paper, we propose
an approach to ownership verification of visual foundation models by
fine-tuning a small set of expressive layers of a VFM along with a small
encoder-decoder network to embed digital watermarks into an internal
representation of a hold-out set of input images. Importantly, the watermarks
embedded remain detectable in the functional copies of the protected model,
obtained, for example, by fine-tuning the VFM for a particular downstream task.
Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed method
yields a low probability of false detection of a non-watermarked model and a
low probability of false misdetection of a watermarked model.

*Koen Vellenga,H. Joe Steinhauer,Jonas Andersson,Anders Sjögren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的潜在不确定性表示（LUR）方法，通过在预训练DNN中添加变换层来生成多个潜在表示以估计不确定性，在视频驾驶员动作和意图识别任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在资源受限的安全关键任务中应用日益广泛，但现有的最后一层概率深度学习方法在检测分布外实例时性能不稳定，需要更有效的不确定性估计方法。

Method: 在预训练DNN基础上添加变换层生成多个潜在表示来估计不确定性，提出了LUR和RLUR（排斥训练LUR）两种方法。

Result: LUR和RLUR在分布内分类性能与其他LL-PDL方法相当，在基于不确定性的OOD检测方面LUR与最佳PDL方法表现相当，且训练更高效、调参更容易。

Conclusion: LUR方法提供了一种高效且易于调参的不确定性估计替代方案，特别适用于资源受限环境中的安全关键任务。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly applied to safety-critical tasks
in resource-constrained environments, such as video-based driver action and
intention recognition. While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL)
methods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance
varies. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending
pre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent
representations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty
representation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against
eight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention
recognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and
uncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action
labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our
results show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution
classification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based
OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more
efficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures.

TL;DR: 使用基于机器学习的螺旋和波浪手绘图分析方法检测帕金森病，通过CNN、迁移学习和注意力机制实现高精度诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病早期诊断对预防不良影响至关重要，但传统诊断方法繁琐且昂贵，需要非侵入性、成本效益高的解决方案。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络、迁移学习和注意力机制，结合数据增强和集成投票策略，通过螺旋和波浪图像进行分析。

Result: 螺旋图像准确率90%，波浪图像准确率96.67%，集成投票后总体准确率达到93.3%。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法在帕金森病早期诊断中具有巨大潜力，提供了一种非侵入性且经济有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition
characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons, leading to various movement
disorder symptoms. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to prevent adverse effects,
yet traditional diagnostic methods are often cumbersome and costly. In this
study, a machine learning-based approach is proposed using hand-drawn spiral
and wave images as potential biomarkers for PD detection. Our methodology
leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and
attention mechanisms to improve model performance and resilience against
overfitting. To enhance the diversity and richness of both spiral and wave
categories, the training dataset undergoes augmentation to increase the number
of images. The proposed architecture comprises three phases: utilizing
pre-trained CNNs, incorporating custom convolutional layers, and ensemble
voting. Employing hard voting further enhances performance by aggregating
predictions from multiple models. Experimental results show promising accuracy
rates. For spiral images, weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are
90%, and for wave images, they are 96.67%. After combining the predictions
through ensemble hard voting, the overall accuracy is 93.3%. These findings
underscore the potential of machine learning in early PD diagnosis, offering a
non-invasive and cost-effective solution to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer
vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships,
long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of
Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders
with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that
transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated
reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature.
This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training
methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars:
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL)
from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced
inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the
roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques,
addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal
grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through
systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design
principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open
challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We
further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate
rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM
capabilities. Additional resources and updates are maintained at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分割匹配比关键点匹配更能捕获结构化区域，对遮挡、光照变化和视角变化具有更强鲁棒性。宽基线分割匹配在极端视角变化下具有挑战性。

Method: 利用3D基础模型的空间理解能力，构建了一个架构，利用这些模型的归纳偏置来匹配视角变化高达180度的图像对中的分割区域。

Conclusion: 该方法在宽基线分割匹配任务中表现出色，并在3D实例分割和图像目标导航等相关下游任务中展示了优势。

Abstract: Segment matching is an important intermediate task in computer vision that
establishes correspondences between semantically or geometrically coherent
regions across images. Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized
features, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater
robustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this
paper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle
wide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme
viewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of
these 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180
degree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and
local feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++
and Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on
relevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance segmentation and image-goal
navigation. Project Page: https://segmast3r.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对对比度失真图像的无参考图像质量评估方法，通过对比度增强算法生成伪参考图像，将NR-IQA问题转化为FR-IQA问题以提高评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比度变化是影响图像质量的重要因素，但在图像质量评估中常被忽视。现有方法主要关注模糊和噪声等失真，而对比度失真的视觉影响和特性与其他失真类型不同。

Method: 使用一组对比度增强算法生成视觉上接近真实参考图像的伪参考图像，训练分类网络根据图像内容和失真选择最合适的对比度增强算法，最后以全参考方式评估对比度增强图像与退化图像之间的质量差异。

Result: 在包含对比度失真的三个数据库（CCID2014、TID2013和CSIQ）上的性能评估表明，该方法具有良好性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成伪参考图像成功将无参考图像质量评估问题转化为全参考评估问题，在对比度失真图像质量评估方面表现出色。

Abstract: Contrast change is an important factor that affects the quality of images.
During image capturing, unfavorable lighting conditions can cause contrast
change and visual quality loss. While various methods have been proposed to
assess the quality of images under different distortions such as blur and
noise, contrast distortion has been largely overlooked as its visual impact and
properties are different from other conventional types of distortions. In this
paper, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric for
contrast-distorted images. Using a set of contrast enhancement algorithms, we
aim to generate pseudo-reference images that are visually close to the actual
reference image, such that the NR problem is transformed to a Full-reference
(FR) assessment with higher accuracy. To this end, a large dataset of
contrast-enhanced images is produced to train a classification network that can
select the most suitable contrast enhancement algorithm based on image content
and distortion for pseudo-reference image generation. Finally, the evaluation
is performed in the FR manner to assess the quality difference between the
contrast-enhanced (pseudoreference) and degraded images. Performance evaluation
of the proposed method on three databases containing contrast distortions
(CCID2014, TID2013, and CSIQ), indicates the promising performance of the
proposed method.

Motivation: 需要高效准确的废物分类和工业表面缺陷检测，以支持可持续废物管理和高质量控制标准，特别是在动态环境中需要自适应能力。

Method: 使用ResNet-50进行局部特征提取，Vision Transformer捕获全局语义上下文，FAISS相似性检索提供记忆参考，神经可塑性模块设计包含可扩展学习块，在训练性能停滞时动态增长。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate classification of waste and industrial surface defects
is essential for ensuring sustainable waste management and maintaining high
standards in quality control. This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular
Classifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image
classification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone
for localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture
global semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is
incorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data,
enriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is
the neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that
dynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by
biological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data
complexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification,
we validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2),
which involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental
results across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms
traditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability. The Neuroplastic
Modular Classifier offers a scalable, high-performance solution for real-world
image classification, with strong applicability in both environmental and
industrial domains.

Motivation: 现代视觉生成模型在生成自然图像方面表现出色，但在处理需要组合规划、文本渲染和多模态推理的结构化视觉内容时表现不佳。

Method: 构建了130万高质量结构化图像对数据集，训练了一个集成VLM和FLUX.1 Kontext的统一模型，采用三阶段训练课程，并在推理时使用外部推理器增强性能。

Result: 评估了15个模型，发现即使是领先的闭源系统也远未达到满意水平。本文模型在编辑任务上表现强劲，推理时推理在不同架构中带来一致增益。

Conclusion: 通过发布数据集、模型和基准测试，旨在推进结构化视觉内容的统一多模态基础。

Abstract: While modern visual generation models excel at creating aesthetically
pleasing natural images, they struggle with producing or editing structured
visuals like charts, diagrams, and mathematical figures, which demand
composition planning, text rendering, and multimodal reasoning for factual
fidelity. To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic
investigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training,
and an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3
million high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing
programs and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on
it, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a
lightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage
training curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion,
and reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at
inference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for
generation and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an
accompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\&A
protocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models
reveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory.
Our model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning
yields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset,
model, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for
structured visuals.

Motivation: 研究如何让来自不同世界（如卡通和真人）的角色在视频中自然交互，同时保持各自的身份特征和行为逻辑，避免风格失真。

Method: 使用交叉角色嵌入（CCE）从多模态数据中学习角色身份和行为逻辑，以及交叉角色增强（CCA）通过合成共存和混合风格数据来丰富训练。

Result: 在包含10个角色的卡通和真人系列基准测试中，在身份保持、交互质量和风格失真鲁棒性方面显示出明显改进。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现先前不共存角色之间的自然交互，同时保持风格保真度，为生成式叙事开辟了新形式。

Abstract: Imagine Mr. Bean stepping into Tom and Jerry--can we generate videos where
characters interact naturally across different worlds? We study inter-character
interaction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve
each character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context
interaction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and
because mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters
appear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these
issues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and
behavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation
(CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style
data. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously
uncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a
curated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show
clear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and
robustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative
storytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型难以合成具有连贯因果链的复杂动态，而多模态模型具有较强的视觉状态推理能力，需要将两者优势结合。

Method: 利用大型多模态模型生成稀疏关键帧作为快照，然后基于这些关键帧对预训练视频生成器进行稀疏推理时微调。

Result: 在复杂的多步骤场景实验中，VChain显著提升了生成视频的质量。

Conclusion: VChain通过注入视觉推理信号，有效增强了视频生成模型处理复杂动态场景的能力，且具有调优效率高、开销小的优势。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce smooth and visually appealing
clips, but they often struggle to synthesize complex dynamics with a coherent
chain of consequences. Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state
transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and
multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and
future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain,
a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual
reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically,
VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to
generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used
to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only
at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal
overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex,
multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of
generated videos.

Method: 构建了包含2,688个企业电话会议的多模态数据集，包括文字记录、完整音频和演示幻灯片，并评估了26个最先进的单模态和多模态大语言模型。

Result: (1) 许多模型的高准确率是由真实数据中的类别不平衡造成的假象；(2) 一些专业金融模型在指令遵循和语言生成方面表现出意外弱点；(3) 虽然加入音频和视觉模态带来性能提升，但当前模型仍难以有效利用这些信号。

Abstract: Predicting corporate earnings surprises is a profitable yet challenging task,
as accurate forecasts can inform significant investment decisions. However,
progress in this domain has been constrained by a reliance on expensive,
proprietary, and text-only data, limiting the development of advanced models.
To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{FinCall-Surprise} (Financial
Conference Call for Earning Surprise Prediction), the first large-scale,
open-source, and multi-modal dataset for earnings surprise prediction.
Comprising 2,688 unique corporate conference calls from 2019 to 2021, our
dataset features word-to-word conference call textual transcripts, full audio
recordings, and corresponding presentation slides. We establish a comprehensive
benchmark by evaluating 26 state-of-the-art unimodal and multi-modal LLMs. Our
findings reveal that (1) while many models achieve high accuracy, this
performance is often an illusion caused by significant class imbalance in the
real-world data. (2) Some specialized financial models demonstrate unexpected
weaknesses in instruction-following and language generation. (3) Although
incorporating audio and visual modalities provides some performance gains,
current models still struggle to leverage these signals effectively. These
results highlight critical limitations in the financial reasoning capabilities
of existing LLMs and establish a challenging new baseline for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态深度学习模型在视频检索方面取得进展，但用户仍需手动浏览排序结果。关键帧在搜索网格中的排列方式影响浏览效果和用户效率，但这一领域研究不足。

Method: 对49名参与者进行实验，评估7种关键帧布局在视觉已知项搜索任务中的表现，分析效率、准确率以及浏览现象（如遗漏）与布局特征的关系。

Result: 视频分组布局效率最高，四列排名保持网格准确率最高。排序网格能快速扫描不感兴趣区域，但会将相关目标降级到不显眼位置，延迟首次到达时间并增加遗漏。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持混合设计，即保留排名靠前项目的位置，同时对剩余项目进行排序或分组，为视频检索及其他网格搜索场景提供指导。

Abstract: Multimodal deep-learning models power interactive video retrieval by ranking
keyframes in response to textual queries. Despite these advances, users must
still browse ranked candidates manually to locate a target. Keyframe
arrangement within the search grid highly affects browsing effectiveness and
user efficiency, yet remains underexplored. We report a study with 49
participants evaluating seven keyframe layouts for the Visual Known-Item Search
task. Beyond efficiency and accuracy, we relate browsing phenomena, such as
overlooks, to layout characteristics. Our results show that a video-grouped
layout is the most efficient, while a four-column, rank-preserving grid
achieves the highest accuracy. Sorted grids reveal potentials and trade-offs,
enabling rapid scanning of uninteresting regions but down-ranking relevant
targets to less prominent positions, delaying first arrival times and
increasing overlooks.
  These findings motivate hybrid designs that preserve positions of top-ranked
items while sorting or grouping the remainder, and offer guidance for searching
in grids beyond video retrieval.

Abstract: Recent advances in browser-based LLM agents have shown promise for automating
tasks ranging from simple form filling to hotel booking or online shopping.
Current benchmarks measure agent performance in controlled environments, such
as containers or stable networks, where websites behave deterministically.
However, in the real world, users access websites over networks and HTTPS
connections that introduce instability from multiple sources: client-side,
server-side issues or broader system failures. Moreover, live websites are
prone to web attacks such Cross-Site Scripting, as well as general site
modifications which can cause unexpected or malicious pop-ups or improper
functionality. To address this gap, we present WAREX: Web Agent Reliability
Evaluation on Existing Benchmarks. We measure the impact of WAREX across three
popular benchmarks: WebArena, WebVoyager, and REAL. Our experiments show that
introducing WAREX leads to significant drops in task success rates,

Abstract: The scarcity of non-renewable energy sources, geopolitical problems in its
supply, increasing prices, and the impact of climate change, force the global
economy to develop more energy-efficient solutions for their operations. The
Manufacturing sector is not excluded from this challenge as one of the largest
consumers of energy. Energy-efficient scheduling is a method that attracts
manufacturing companies to reduce their consumption as it can be quickly
deployed and can show impact immediately. In this study, the hybrid flow shop
scheduling problem with blocking constraint (BHFS) is investigated in which we
seek to minimize the latest completion time (i.e. makespan) and overall energy
consumption, a typical manufacturing setting across many industries from
automotive to pharmaceutical. Energy consumption and the latest completion time
of customer orders are usually conflicting objectives. Therefore, we first
formulate the problem as a novel multi-objective mixed integer programming
(MIP) model and propose an augmented epsilon-constraint method for finding the
Pareto-optimal solutions. Also, an effective multi-objective metaheuristic
algorithm. Refined Iterated Pareto Greedy (RIPG), is developed to solve large
instances in reasonable time. Our proposed methods are benchmarked using small,
medium, and large-size instances to evaluate their efficiency. Two well-known
algorithms are adopted for comparing our novel approaches. The computational

*Xiaoyan Bai,Aryan Shrivastava,Ari Holtzman,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了10个当代大语言模型的自我识别能力，发现模型普遍存在自我识别失败，仅4个模型能正确识别自身生成文本，且表现很少优于随机猜测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对AI系统是否具备自我识别能力这一存在矛盾解释的问题，作者旨在建立一个可轻松应用和更新的系统评估框架，以澄清模型是否真正具备自我识别这一关键元认知能力。

Method: 通过两个任务评估模型：二元自我识别（识别自身生成文本vs其他模型文本）和精确模型预测，评估了10个当代大语言模型。

Result: 结果显示模型自我识别能力普遍失败，仅4/10模型能预测自身为生成者，性能很少优于随机机会。模型还表现出强烈偏向预测GPT和Claude家族的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI系统在自我识别方面的局限性，讨论了这些发现对AI安全的影响，并提出了发展适当AI自我意识的未来方向。

Abstract: Self-recognition is a crucial metacognitive capability for AI systems,
relevant not only for psychological analysis but also for safety, particularly
in evaluative scenarios. Motivated by contradictory interpretations of whether
models possess self-recognition (Panickssery et al., 2024; Davidson et al.,
2024), we introduce a systematic evaluation framework that can be easily
applied and updated. Specifically, we measure how well 10 contemporary larger
language models (LLMs) can identify their own generated text versus text from
other models through two tasks: binary self-recognition and exact model
prediction. Different from prior claims, our results reveal a consistent
failure in self-recognition. Only 4 out of 10 models predict themselves as
generators, and the performance is rarely above random chance. Additionally,
models exhibit a strong bias toward predicting GPT and Claude families. We also
provide the first evaluation of model awareness of their own and others'
existence, as well as the reasoning behind their choices in self-recognition.
We find that the model demonstrates some knowledge of its own existence and
other models, but their reasoning reveals a hierarchical bias. They appear to
assume that GPT, Claude, and occasionally Gemini are the top-tier models, often
associating high-quality text with them. We conclude by discussing the
implications of our findings on AI safety and future directions to develop
appropriate AI self-awareness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ContraGen基准框架，专门针对企业领域生成包含矛盾内容的合成文档，用于系统评估RAG系统的矛盾检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矛盾检测基准仅限于句子级别分析，无法捕捉企业文档（如合同、财务报告等）的复杂性，而企业环境中矛盾可能导致不可靠输出，影响合规性和问责制。

Method: 结合自动化矛盾挖掘和人工验证，生成企业风格文档并嵌入矛盾，建立矛盾类型分类法，开发矛盾感知的检索评估流程。

Result: 创建了专门针对企业领域的矛盾检测基准框架，能够系统评估文档内和跨文档的一致性。

Conclusion: 为企业信息检索应用中的RAG系统建立了更可靠和可问责的基础，矛盾检测对于降低风险和确保合规性至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates LLMs with external sources,
offering advanced capabilities for information access and decision-making.
However, contradictions in retrieved evidence can result in inconsistent or
untrustworthy outputs, which is especially problematic in enterprise settings
where compliance, governance, and accountability are critical. Existing
benchmarks for contradiction detection are limited to sentence-level analysis
and do not capture the complexity of enterprise documents such as contracts,
financial filings, compliance reports, or policy manuals. To address this
limitation, we propose ContraGen, a contradiction-aware benchmark framework
tailored to enterprise domain. The framework generates synthetic
enterprise-style documents with embedded contradictions, enabling systematic
evaluation of both intra-document and cross-document consistency. Automated
contradiction mining is combined with human-in-the-loop validation to ensure
high accuracy. Our contributions include generating realistic enterprise
documents, modeling a taxonomy of contradiction types common in business
processes, enabling controlled creation of self- and pairwise contradictions,
developing a contradiction-aware retrieval evaluation pipeline and embedding
human oversight to reflect domain-specific judgment complexity. This work
establishes a foundation for more trustworthy and accountable RAG systems in
enterprise information-seeking applications, where detecting and resolving
contradictions is essential for reducing risk and ensuring compliance.

Motivation: 认知架构理论和生成神经架构理论在评估方面都面临挑战，本文旨在解决这一双重挑战。

Method: 采用广泛的理论评估视角，对全思维导向的认知架构和生成架构及其完整系统进行定性比较分析。

Result: 提出了一个全面的定性比较框架，涵盖了认知架构和生成架构的评估维度。

Conclusion: 通过广泛的理论评估视角，能够有效应对认知架构和生成架构在评估方面的挑战，为理论评估提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical activity associated with any theory. Yet this has
proven to be an exceptionally challenging activity for theories based on
cognitive architectures. For an overlapping set of reasons, evaluation can also
be challenging for theories based on generative neural architectures. This dual
challenge is approached here by leveraging a broad perspective on theory
evaluation to yield a wide-ranging, albeit qualitative, comparison of
whole-mind-oriented cognitive and generative architectures and the full systems
that are based on these architectures.

Motivation: 需要系统性地验证自然语言计划与其预期行为之间的一致性，确保计划的正确执行。

Method: 使用大型语言模型将自然语言计划转换为Kripke结构和线性时序逻辑公式，然后进行模型检查验证。

Result: GPT-5在PlanBench数据集上取得了96.3%的F1分数，几乎总能生成语法完美的形式化表示。

Conclusion: 框架在分类性能上表现优秀，但语义完美形式化模型的合成仍需进一步探索。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for evaluating the alignment between natural
language plans and their expected behavior by converting them into Kripke
structures and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using Large Language Models (LLMs)
and performing model checking. We systematically evaluate this framework on a
simplified version of the PlanBench plan verification dataset and report on
metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 scores. Our experiments
demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves excellent classification performance (F1 score
of 96.3%) while almost always producing syntactically perfect formal
representations that can act as guarantees. However, the synthesis of
semantically perfect formal models remains an area for future exploration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PolicyGuardBench基准和PolicyGuard-4B模型，用于检测网络代理轨迹中的策略违规，支持跨域泛化和小规模高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主网络代理需要在外部策略约束下生成长视野轨迹，但现有研究很少关注这些轨迹是否遵守策略，以及违规行为在不同上下文中的持续性。

Method: 从多样化代理运行中生成广泛策略集，创建约60k个带违规标签的示例，包括子域内和跨子域配对，并设计了完整轨迹和基于前缀的违规检测任务。

Result: 训练的PolicyGuard-4B模型在所有任务上表现出强大的检测准确性，同时保持推理效率，能够跨域泛化并在未见设置上保持高准确率。

Conclusion: PolicyGuardBench和PolicyGuard-4B为研究网络代理轨迹的策略合规性提供了首个综合框架，证明了小规模下准确且可泛化的护栏是可行的。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents need to operate under externally imposed or
human-specified policies while generating long-horizon trajectories. However,
little work has examined whether these trajectories comply with such policies,
or whether policy violations persist across different contexts such as domains
(e.g., shopping or coding websites) and subdomains (e.g., product search and
order management in shopping). To address this gap, we introduce
PolicyGuardBench, a benchmark of about 60k examples for detecting policy
violations in agent trajectories. From diverse agent runs, we generate a broad
set of policies and create both within subdomain and cross subdomain pairings
with violation labels. In addition to full-trajectory evaluation,
PolicyGuardBench also includes a prefix-based violation detection task where
models must anticipate policy violations from truncated trajectory prefixes
rather than complete sequences. Using this dataset, we train PolicyGuard-4B, a
lightweight guardrail model that delivers strong detection accuracy across all
tasks while keeping inference efficient. Notably, PolicyGuard-4B generalizes
across domains and preserves high accuracy on unseen settings. Together,
PolicyGuardBench and PolicyGuard-4B provide the first comprehensive framework
for studying policy compliance in web agent trajectories, and show that
accurate and generalizable guardrails are feasible at small scales.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OneFlow是首个非自回归多模态模型，支持变长和并发的混合模态生成，通过插入式编辑流和流匹配技术，在减少50%训练计算量的同时，在生成和理解任务上超越自回归基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归模型在文本和图像生成之间强制因果顺序的局限性，实现更灵活的并发多模态生成。

Method: 结合插入式编辑流处理离散文本标记，使用流匹配处理图像潜在表示，采用分层采样优先内容而非语法。

Result: 在1B到8B模型规模上，OneFlow在生成和理解任务上均优于自回归基线，同时减少高达50%的训练计算量，超越了自回归和基于扩散的方法。

Conclusion: OneFlow解锁了并发生成、迭代优化和类自然推理生成等新能力，为非自回归多模态建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present OneFlow, the first non-autoregressive multimodal model that
enables variable-length and concurrent mixed-modal generation. Unlike
autoregressive models that enforce rigid causal ordering between text and image
generation, OneFlow combines an insertion-based Edit Flow for discrete text
tokens with Flow Matching for image latents. OneFlow enables concurrent
text-image synthesis with hierarchical sampling that prioritizes content over
grammar. Through controlled experiments across model sizes from 1B to 8B, we
demonstrate that OneFlow outperforms autoregressive baselines on both
generation and understanding tasks while using up to 50% fewer training FLOPs.
OneFlow surpasses both autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches while
unlocking new capabilities for concurrent generation, iterative refinement, and
natural reasoning-like generation.

### [182] [Understanding the Role of Training Data in Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03605)
*Adel Javanmard,Baharan Mirzasoleiman,Vahab Mirrokni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 测试时扩展通过生成更长的思维链来提升大语言模型的推理能力，但长思维链何时出现以及何时能提升性能仍不清楚。本文通过线性回归的上下文权重预测任务，从理论上解释了测试时扩展的几个关键现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究测试时扩展在何种训练数据条件下会产生长思维链，以及长思维链何时能真正提升模型性能，为理解大语言模型的推理机制提供理论解释。

Method: 在Transformer模型上训练上下文权重预测任务，分析测试时计算扩展对性能的影响，并通过特征协方差矩阵的最小特征值来表征任务难度。

Result: 发现：1）在固定测试误差下，增加测试时计算可减少训练提示中的上下文示例数量；2）当下游任务所需技能在训练数据中不足时，增加测试时计算反而会损害性能；3）在多样化、相关且困难的任务集上训练可获得最佳测试时扩展性能。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展的有效性取决于训练数据的质量和多样性，任务难度特征可用于指导训练数据的选择，从而最大化测试时扩展的收益。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating extra compute to generate longer Chains-of-Thoughts
(CoTs). This enables models to tackle more complex problem by breaking them
down into additional steps, backtracking, and correcting mistakes. Despite its
strong performance--demonstrated by OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek R1, the conditions
in the training data under which long CoTs emerge, and when such long CoTs
improve the performance, remain unclear. In this paper, we study the
performance of test-time scaling for transformers trained on an in-context
weight prediction task for linear regression. Our analysis provides a
theoretical explanation for several intriguing observations: First, at any
fixed test error, increasing test-time compute allows us to reduce the number
of in-context examples (context length) in training prompts. Second, if the
skills required to solve a downstream task are not sufficiently present in the
training data, increasing test-time compute can harm performance. Finally, we
characterize task hardness via the smallest eigenvalue of its feature
covariance matrix and show that training on a diverse, relevant, and hard set
of tasks results in best performance for test-time scaling. We confirm our
findings with experiments on large, nonlinear transformer architectures.

TL;DR: 提出跨模态偏好引导(CPS)攻击方法，通过联合优化视觉和文本模态的不可察觉修改，在黑盒设置下有效操控基于视觉语言模型的网络代理决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法要么假设白盒访问权限，要么使用不切实际的设置，缺乏在真实攻击者能力下的有效偏好操控方法。

Method: CPS联合优化物品视觉和自然语言描述的不可察觉修改，利用CLIP可迁移图像扰动和RLHF诱导的语言偏见来引导代理决策。

Result: 在电影选择和电商任务上，CPS在所有测试模型上均显著优于基线方法，同时保持70%更低的检测率。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了随着智能系统在社会中扮演越来越重要角色，迫切需要开发鲁棒防御机制。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM)-based web agents increasingly power high-stakes
selection tasks like content recommendation or product ranking by combining
multimodal perception with preference reasoning. Recent studies reveal that
these agents are vulnerable against attackers who can bias selection outcomes
through preference manipulations using adversarial pop-ups, image
perturbations, or content tweaks. Existing work, however, either assumes strong
white-box access, with limited single-modal perturbations, or uses impractical
settings. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that joint
exploitation of visual and textual channels yields significantly more powerful
preference manipulations under realistic attacker capabilities. We introduce
Cross-Modal Preference Steering (CPS) that jointly optimizes imperceptible
modifications to an item's visual and natural language descriptions, exploiting
CLIP-transferable image perturbations and RLHF-induced linguistic biases to
steer agent decisions. In contrast to prior studies that assume gradient
access, or control over webpages, or agent memory, we adopt a realistic
black-box threat setup: a non-privileged adversary can edit only their own
listing's images and textual metadata, with no insight into the agent's model
internals. We evaluate CPS on agents powered by state-of-the-art proprietary
and open source VLMs including GPT-4.1, Qwen-2.5VL and Pixtral-Large on both
movie selection and e-commerce tasks. Our results show that CPS is
significantly more effective than leading baseline methods. For instance, our
results show that CPS consistently outperforms baselines across all models
while maintaining 70% lower detection rates, demonstrating both effectiveness
and stealth. These findings highlight an urgent need for robust defenses as
agentic systems play an increasingly consequential role in society.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有树搜索方法中难以对中间推理步骤进行即时可靠评估，以及广泛路径探索计算成本高的问题。

Method: 引入基于点互信息的评分函数进行路径评估，采用波束搜索扩展搜索树，结合熵基动态采样策略自适应分配计算资源，最后使用加权投票方案进行预测。

Result: 在多样化推理基准测试中，MITS一致超越基线方法，建立了原则性且高效的LLM推理框架。

Conclusion: MITS提供了一个基于信息论原则的推理框架，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了推理性能。

Abstract: Tree search has become as a representative framework for test-time reasoning
with large language models (LLMs), exemplified by methods such as
Tree-of-Thought and Monte Carlo Tree Search that explore multiple reasoning
paths. However, it remains difficult to provide instant and reliable
quantitative assessments of intermediate reasoning step quality, and extensive
path exploration is computationally costly. To address this, we propose Mutual
Information Tree Search (MITS), a novel framework that guides reasoning with
information-theoretic principles. MITS introduces an effective scoring function
based on pointwise mutual information (PMI), which enables step-wise evaluation
of reasoning paths and search tree expansion via beam search without expensive
look-ahead simulations, achieving superior reasoning performances while
maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is complemented by an
entropy-based dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively allocates computational
resources to uncertain reasoning steps where exploration is most beneficial.
For final prediction, MITS employs a weighted voting scheme that combines PMI
scores with prediction consensus. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse
reasoning benchmarks, MITS consistently surpasses baseline methods,
establishing a principled and efficient framework for LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)存在"<eos>溢出"问题：随着序列长度增加，响应反而变短，导致提前终止或退化为<eos>标记流。作者提出Rainbow Padding方法，用循环的不同填充标记替换重复<eos>，有效解决了该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优的扩散大语言模型存在一个关键漏洞：<eos>溢出问题。当分配的序列长度增加时，响应反而变得更短，出现提前终止或退化为<eos>标记流的现象。虽然实践中已注意到此问题，但尚未得到系统分析。

Method: 提出了Rainbow Padding方法，用循环的不同填充标记替换重复的<eos>占位符，分散概率质量并打破<eos>的主导地位。该方法可以高效集成到现有指令调优模型中，仅需单轮LoRA微调和少量数据即可显著改进。

Result: 实验表明，Rainbow Padding显著提高了长度鲁棒性和输出质量，仅需7个填充标记就足以防止提前终止。该方法在实际应用中表现出色，能够有效解决<eos>溢出问题。

Conclusion: Rainbow Padding是一种简单有效的解决方案，通过打破<eos>的双重角色（终止和填充）来解决扩散大语言模型的早期终止问题，具有很高的实用价值。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models, offering flexible generation orders and
strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. However, instruction-tuned dLLMs
exhibit a critical vulnerability we term \texttt{<eos>} overflow: as allocated
sequence length increases, responses paradoxically become shorter, collapsing
into early termination or degenerating into streams of \texttt{<eos>} tokens.
Although noticed in practice, this issue has not been systematically analyzed.
We trace its root cause to the dual role of \texttt{<eos>} as both termination
and padding, which concentrates probability mass on \texttt{<eos>} at later
positions and propagates backward to trigger early termination. To address
this, we introduce Rainbow Padding, a simple remedy that replaces repeated
\texttt{<eos>} placeholders with a repeating cycle of distinct padding tokens,
distributing probability mass and breaking \texttt{<eos>} dominance.
Experiments show that Rainbow Padding substantially improves length robustness
and output quality, with as few as seven padding tokens sufficient to prevent
early termination. Moreover, the method integrates efficiently into existing
instruction-tuned models: LoRA fine-tuning for a single epoch on minimal data
yields significant improvements, making this solution highly practical. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/quasar529/rainbow-padding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多在轮次层面评估多轮聊天机器人交互，无法判断用户总体目标是否达成，需要更全面的目标导向评估框架。

Method: 将对话按用户目标分段，使用教师LLM结合领域专家定义的目标和质量标准进行评估，通过"思考标记"生成可解释的推理过程。

Result: 在企业环境中应用该框架评估AIDA员工对话系统，观察到目标成功率从63%提升到79%。

Conclusion: 该通用框架通过详细的缺陷分类法提供可操作的见解，能够诊断整体成功率、识别关键失败模式并指导系统改进。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of multi-turn chatbot interactions remains
challenging, as most existing methods assess interactions at the turn level
without addressing whether a user's overarching goal was fulfilled. A ``goal''
here refers to an information need or task, such as asking for policy
information or applying for leave. We propose a comprehensive framework for
goal-oriented evaluation of multi-agent systems (MAS), introducing the
\textbf{Goal Success Rate (GSR)} to measure the percentage of fulfilled goals,
and a \textbf{Root Cause of Failure (RCOF)} taxonomy to identify reasons for
failure in multi-agent chatbots. Our method segments conversations by user
goals and evaluates success using all relevant turns. We present a model-based
evaluation system combining teacher LLMs, where domain experts define goals,
set quality standards serving as a guidance for the LLMs. The LLMs use
``thinking tokens'' to produce interpretable rationales, enabling
\textit{explainable}, \textit{data-efficient} evaluations. In an enterprise
setting, we apply our framework to evaluate AIDA, a zero-to-one employee
conversational agent system built as a ground-up multi-agent conversational
agent, and observe GSR improvement from 63\% to 79\% over six months since its
inception. Our framework is generic and offers actionable insights through a
detailed defect taxonomy based on analysis of failure points in multi-agent
chatbots, diagnosing overall success, identifying key failure modes, and
informing system improvements.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了H-DDx分层评估框架，用于更准确地评估LLM在鉴别诊断中的表现，克服传统扁平指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在鉴别诊断评估中主要依赖扁平指标（如Top-k准确率），无法区分临床相关近误和诊断遥远错误，需要更符合临床相关性的评估方法。

Method: H-DDx框架采用检索和重排序流程将自由文本诊断映射到ICD-10代码，并应用分层度量来奖励与真实诊断密切相关的预测。

Result: 在22个领先模型的基准测试中，传统扁平指标因忽略临床有意义的输出而低估了性能，领域专业化开源模型表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架通过揭示分层错误模式增强了可解释性，表明LLM即使错过精确诊断，也经常能正确识别更广泛的临床背景。

Abstract: An accurate differential diagnosis (DDx) is essential for patient care,
shaping therapeutic decisions and influencing outcomes. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools to support this process
by generating a DDx list from patient narratives. However, existing evaluations
of LLMs in this domain primarily rely on flat metrics, such as Top-k accuracy,
which fail to distinguish between clinically relevant near-misses and
diagnostically distant errors. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce H-DDx,
a hierarchical evaluation framework that better reflects clinical relevance.
H-DDx leverages a retrieval and reranking pipeline to map free-text diagnoses
to ICD-10 codes and applies a hierarchical metric that credits predictions
closely related to the ground-truth diagnosis. In benchmarking 22 leading
models, we show that conventional flat metrics underestimate performance by
overlooking clinically meaningful outputs, with our results highlighting the
strengths of domain-specialized open-source models. Furthermore, our framework
enhances interpretability by revealing hierarchical error patterns,
demonstrating that LLMs often correctly identify the broader clinical context
even when the precise diagnosis is missed.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨如何将多模态基础模型提升为世界模型，通过增强其推理能力和生成能力，使其能够进行反事实推理、理解时空信息并实现可控生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类多感官理解世界的启发，当前的多模态基础模型在作为世界模型方面存在不足，缺乏反事实推理、动态模拟、时空理解和可控生成等关键能力。

Method: 通过判别任务增强推理能力，引入因果推理、反事实思维和时空推理等结构化推理技能；在生成方面，采用场景图、多模态条件化和对齐策略，实现结构化可控生成，并扩展到可控4D生成。

Result: 开发了能够超越表面相关性、理解深层关系的新型多模态基础模型，实现了与高层语义和用户意图一致的生成控制，支持交互式、可编辑的时空对象合成。

Conclusion: 通过系统性地增强推理和生成能力，成功缩小了多模态基础模型与世界模型之间的差距，为构建更智能的多模态系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Humans understand the world through the integration of multiple sensory
modalities, enabling them to perceive, reason about, and imagine dynamic
physical processes. Inspired by this capability, multimodal foundation models
(MFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal understanding and
generation. However, today's MFMs fall short of serving as effective world
models. They lack the essential ability such as perform counterfactual
reasoning, simulate dynamics, understand the spatiotemporal information,
control generated visual outcomes, and perform multifaceted reasoning. We
investigates what it takes to bridge the gap between multimodal foundation
models and world models. We begin by improving the reasoning capabilities of
MFMs through discriminative tasks and equipping MFMs with structured reasoning
skills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal
reasoning, enabling them to go beyond surface correlations and understand
deeper relationships within visual and textual data. Next, we explore
generative capabilities of multimodal foundation models across both image and
video modalities, introducing new frameworks for structured and controllable
generation. Our approaches incorporate scene graphs, multimodal conditioning,
and multimodal alignment strategies to guide the generation process, ensuring
consistency with high-level semantics and fine-grained user intent. We further
extend these techniques to controllable 4D generation, enabling interactive,
editable, and morphable object synthesis over time and space.

TL;DR: OptAgent框架结合多智能体模拟和遗传算法，用于优化电子商务查询重写任务，通过模拟购物顾客的多个LLM智能体作为动态奖励信号，在1000个真实查询上实现21.98%的平均改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在主观任务（如电子商务查询重写）中难以评估，因为这类任务缺乏单一正确答案，需要可靠的方法来验证和优化用户意图的捕捉。

Method: 使用多个基于LLM的智能体模拟购物顾客作为动态奖励信号，结合遗传算法迭代优化用户初始查询，智能体评分平均值作为适应度函数。

Result: 在1000个真实电子商务查询的五个类别上测试，相比原始查询平均改进21.98%，相比Best-of-N LLM重写基线改进3.36%。

Conclusion: OptAgent框架通过多智能体模拟和进化算法有效解决了电子商务查询重写的主观评估挑战，显著提升了查询质量。

Abstract: Deploying capable and user-aligned LLM-based systems necessitates reliable
evaluation. While LLMs excel in verifiable tasks like coding and mathematics,
where gold-standard solutions are available, adoption remains challenging for
subjective tasks that lack a single correct answer. E-commerce Query Rewriting
(QR) is one such problem where determining whether a rewritten query properly
captures the user intent is extremely difficult to figure out algorithmically.
In this work, we introduce OptAgent, a novel framework that combines
multi-agent simulations with genetic algorithms to verify and optimize queries
for QR. Instead of relying on a static reward model or a single LLM judge, our
approach uses multiple LLM-based agents, each acting as a simulated shopping
customer, as a dynamic reward signal. The average of these agent-derived scores
serves as an effective fitness function for an evolutionary algorithm that
iteratively refines the user's initial query. We evaluate OptAgent on a dataset
of 1000 real-world e-commerce queries in five different categories, and we
observe an average improvement of 21.98% over the original user query and 3.36%
over a Best-of-N LLM rewriting baseline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重复采样方法在推理时虽然能提升模型性能，但往往无法生成多样化的解决方案，容易产生冗余样本，限制了其效果。

Method: 提出GuidedSampling算法，将推理过程分为探索阶段和生成阶段：探索阶段识别解决问题的多个概念，生成阶段应用特定概念提供最终解决方案候选。

Result: 在pass@50指标上平均提升21.6%，使用GuidedSampling训练模型在pass@5上平均提升9.7%，每个实例的平均概念数从1.67增加到3.03。

Conclusion: GuidedSampling通过增加解决方案多样性有效提升了模型性能，为推理时算法设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Repeated Sampling (RS) is a simple inference-time algorithm that has been
shown to improve model performance on complex tasks. Although it is an
effective way of scaling inference time, it often struggles to generate diverse
solution candidates, frequently relying on the same underlying approach to
solve the problem and thus producing redundant samples. To address this
limitation, we propose a new inference algorithm, GuidedSampling, which
decouples the exploration and generation phases during inference, increasing
diversity of generated candidate solutions. The exploration phase identifies
multiple concepts that can be utilized to solve the problem, while the
generation phase applies a specific concept to provide final solution
candidates. We first define the theoretical bounds of GuidedSampling and then
empirically demonstrate that it improves the performance of base model at
pass@50 by on an average ~21.6% across various benchmarks compared to RS.
Furthermore, models trained on trajectories of GuidedSampling exhibit
substantial performance improvements at pass@5 by on an average ~9.7%, compared
to models trained on traditional RS. Additionally, models trained with
GuidedSampling increases the average number of concepts per instance (1.67 ->
3.03), yielding a diverse set of candidates than traditional RS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于AI对齐和语言游戏中的挑战，针对每个玩家存在未知策略子集持续产生更高奖励的情况，探索能否设计高效算法来发现和利用这种隐藏结构。

Method: 开发了一种遗憾最小化技术的组合方法，实现了最优的外部遗憾和交换遗憾界限，利用隐藏游戏结构提高计算效率。

Result: 算法能够快速收敛到隐藏子游戏中的相关均衡，同时保持一般情况下的理性，证明了隐藏游戏问题的高效可解性。

Conclusion: 肯定地回答了中心问题，证明可以设计高效遗憾最小化算法来发现和利用隐藏游戏结构，实现子游戏均衡收敛和一般理性保持。

Abstract: This paper investigates a class of games with large strategy spaces,
motivated by challenges in AI alignment and language games. We introduce the
hidden game problem, where for each player, an unknown subset of strategies
consistently yields higher rewards compared to the rest. The central question
is whether efficient regret minimization algorithms can be designed to discover
and exploit such hidden structures, leading to equilibrium in these subgames
while maintaining rationality in general. We answer this question affirmatively
by developing a composition of regret minimization techniques that achieve
optimal external and swap regret bounds. Our approach ensures rapid convergence
to correlated equilibria in hidden subgames, leveraging the hidden game
structure for improved computational efficiency.

*Raghav Sharma,Manan Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 小语言模型（1-20B参数）在需要模式约束准确性的智能体任务中比大模型更高效，通过引导解码、严格JSON模式输出和验证器优先执行等技术，能以10-100倍更低的成本实现相似或更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在智能体任务中成本高昂且延迟较大，而小语言模型在模式约束的任务中可能更高效，但需要系统化方法来弥补能力差距。

Method: 采用引导解码库、严格JSON模式输出、验证器优先工具执行，构建SLM默认、LLM回退系统，包含不确定性感知路由和验证器级联。

Result: 小语言模型在工具使用、函数调用和RAG任务中能匹配或超越大模型，成本降低10-100倍，延迟和能耗显著改善。

Conclusion: 小语言模型是构建快速、廉价、可靠智能体的实用方案，通过适当的设计模式可在保持性能的同时大幅降低成本。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs; 1-12B params, sometimes up to 20B) are
sufficient and often superior for agentic workloads where the objective is
schema- and API-constrained accuracy rather than open-ended generation. We
synthesize recent evidence across open and proprietary SLMs (Phi-4-Mini,
Qwen-2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2-1B/3B, Ministral-3B/8B, Apple on-device 3B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill) and connect it to modern evaluations (BFCL v3/v4,
StableToolBench) and serving stacks (vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM) paired with
guided decoding libraries (XGrammar, Outlines). We formalize SLM-default,
LLM-fallback systems with uncertainty-aware routing and verifier cascades, and
propose engineering metrics that reflect real production goals: cost per
successful task (CPS), schema validity rate, executable call rate, p50/p95
latency, and energy per request. Guided decoding, strict JSON Schema outputs,
and validator-first tool execution close much of the capability gap with larger
models and often let SLMs match or surpass LLMs on tool use, function calling,
and RAG at 10x-100x lower token cost with materially better latency and energy.
We provide design patterns for agent stacks that prioritize SLMs: schema-first
prompting, type-safe function registries, confidence scoring with verifier
rollups, and lightweight adaptation via LoRA/QLoRA. We also delineate limits
where fallback remains valuable (open-domain reasoning and some long-horizon
planning). The result is a practical blueprint for building fast, inexpensive,
and reliable agents that default to SLMs while preserving headroom with
targeted LLM assistance.

*Ruiying Ma,Chieh-Jan Mike Liang,Yanjie Gao,Francis Y. Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaMuse框架通过三个自反思原则解决LLM在算法生成中的创造力不足问题，在缓存替换和在线装箱问题上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统算法设计面临解空间不连续的挑战，工程师通常依赖通用启发式方法而牺牲性能。研究发现LLM在算法生成时偏向知名通用设计，缺乏创造性突破。

Method: 提出MetaMuse框架，基于三个自反思原则：(1)在可测量的性能空间而非抽象想法空间量化解决方案多样性和有用性；(2)通过外部刺激而非内部随机性引导构思；(3)使用路径点推理而非自由形式的思维链构建可执行解决方案。

Result: 在缓存替换问题上减少缓存未命中率高达35.76%，在在线装箱问题上减少容器使用量高达30.93%。

Conclusion: MetaMuse能够为全球云提供商的关键问题生成高性能解决方案，证明了该框架在驱动创造性算法生成方面的有效性。

Abstract: Designing system algorithms remains challenging, where the discontinuous
nature of the solution space often forces system engineers to rely on generic
heuristics at the expense of performance. We study whether LLMs can practically
drive algorithm generation, and find that they are biased towards well-known
generic designs, rather than making the creative leaps needed to navigate the
discontinuous solution space. To address this limitation, we introduce
MetaMuse, a framework for creative ideation built on three self-reflection
principles: (1) quantifying solution diversity and usefulness in measurable
performance space, rather than abstract idea space, (2) steering ideation
through external stimuli, rather than internal randomness, and (3) constructing
executable solutions using waypoint reasoning, rather than free-form
chain-of-thought. Extensive evaluation shows that MetaMuse can generate
high-performing solutions for two critical problems at a global cloud provider:
cache replacement (reducing cache misses by up to 35.76%) and online bin
packing (reducing bin usage by up to 30.93%).

*Raghav Sharma,Manan Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM和XAI代理的智能异常检测方法，用于关键IoT系统，在动态高维环境中提升检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法在复杂IoT系统（如智能医疗、能源电网）中存在局限性，特别是在数据不完整、混乱或持续演化的动态高维环境中。需要自适应、智能的系统来持续改进和推理。

Method: 使用LLM支持的上下文推理方法与XAI代理相结合，利用注意力机制、跳过时间步细节处理和使用语义记忆缓冲区来发现隐藏模式和数据流不一致性。

Result: 在真实世界智能电网和医疗场景模拟中测试，新方法在检测准确性和可解释性方面显著优于现有模型，同时保持系统响应速度。

Conclusion: LLM增强的异常检测方法在IoT环境中表现出优越性能，有望成为未来异常检测任务的有力解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that critical IoT systems function safely and smoothly depends a lot
on finding anomalies quickly. As more complex systems, like smart healthcare,
energy grids and industrial automation, appear, it is easier to see the
shortcomings of older methods of detection. Monitoring failures usually happen
in dynamic, high dimensional situations, especially when data is incomplete,
messy or always evolving. Such limits point out the requirement for adaptive,
intelligent systems that always improve and think. LLMs are now capable of
significantly changing how context is understood and semantic inference is done
across all types of data. This proposal suggests using an LLM supported
contextual reasoning method along with XAI agents to improve how anomalies are
found in significant IoT environments. To discover hidden patterns and notice
inconsistencies in data streams, it uses attention methods, avoids dealing with
details from every time step and uses memory buffers with meaning. Because no
code AI stresses transparency and interpretability, people can check and accept
the AI's decisions, helping ensure AI follows company policies. The two
architectures are put together in a test that compares the results of the
traditional model with those of the suggested LLM enhanced model. Important
measures to check are the accuracy of detection, how much inaccurate
information is included in the results, how clearly the findings can be read
and how fast the system responds under different test situations. The
metaheuristic is tested in simulations of real world smart grid and healthcare
contexts to check its adaptability and reliability. From the study, we see that
the new approach performs much better than most existing models in both
accuracy and interpretation, so it could be a good fit for future anomaly
detection tasks in IoT

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Spatial CAPTCHA，一种利用人类与多模态大语言模型在空间推理能力上根本差异的新型验证框架，通过几何推理、视角转换、遮挡处理和心理旋转等任务来区分人类和AI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAPTCHA依赖文本识别或2D图像理解，但多模态大语言模型的进步已削弱其有效性，需要开发基于更高层次认知差异的验证机制。

Method: 采用程序化生成流水线，包含基于约束的难度控制、自动正确性验证和人在环验证，生成需要空间推理的动态问题。

Result: 在Spatial-CAPTCHA-Bench基准测试中，人类表现远超10个最先进的多模态大语言模型，最佳模型仅达到31.0%的Pass@1准确率，且与Google reCAPTCHA相比显示出更好的安全性和诊断能力。

Conclusion: Spatial CAPTCHA通过利用人类与AI在空间推理上的根本差异，提供了一种有效且可扩展的验证机制，同时可作为评估AI空间推理能力的诊断工具。

Abstract: Online services rely on CAPTCHAs as a first line of defense against automated
abuse, yet recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have
eroded the effectiveness of conventional designs that focus on text recognition
or 2D image understanding. To address this challenge, we present Spatial
CAPTCHA, a novel human-verification framework that leverages fundamental
differences in spatial reasoning between humans and MLLMs. Unlike existing
CAPTCHAs which rely on low-level perception tasks that are vulnerable to modern
AI, Spatial CAPTCHA generates dynamic questions requiring geometric reasoning,
perspective-taking, occlusion handling, and mental rotation. These skills are
intuitive for humans but difficult for state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI systems. The
system employs a procedural generation pipeline with constraint-based
difficulty control, automated correctness verification, and human-in-the-loop
validation to ensure scalability, robustness, and adaptability. Evaluation on a
corresponding benchmark, Spatial-CAPTCHA-Bench, demonstrates that humans vastly
outperform 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs, with the best model achieving only 31.0%
Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore, we compare Spatial CAPTCHA with Google reCAPTCHA,
which confirms its effectiveness as both a security mechanism and a diagnostic
tool for spatial reasoning in AI.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需额外训练或外部模块的方法，通过扩大文本标记嵌入的表示空间来增强多模态扩散变换器对罕见语义的生成能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前先进的多模态扩散变换器在处理富有想象力或罕见的提示词时仍然表现不佳，因为这些概念在预训练中过于稀缺而未能形成强表征

Method: 在联合注意力块之前，通过数学方法扩大文本标记嵌入周围的表示空间（方差放大），使罕见语义在输出中清晰显现

Result: 该方法能有效提升模型对罕见语义的生成能力，并在文本到图像、文本到视频和文本驱动的图像编辑等任务中表现出良好的泛化性

Conclusion: 该方法能够揭示用户意图中原本隐藏但可被激发的语义，为生成模型提供了新的能力提升途径

Abstract: Starting from flow- and diffusion-based transformers, Multi-modal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiTs) have reshaped text-to-vision generation, gaining acclaim
for exceptional visual fidelity. As these models advance, users continually
push the boundary with imaginative or rare prompts, which advanced models still
falter in generating, since their concepts are often too scarce to leave a
strong imprint during pre-training. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective intervention that surfaces rare semantics inside MM-DiTs without
additional training steps, data, denoising-time optimization, or reliance on
external modules (e.g., large language models). In particular, the
joint-attention mechanism intrinsic to MM-DiT sequentially updates text
embeddings alongside image embeddings throughout transformer blocks. We find
that by mathematically expanding representational basins around text token
embeddings via variance scale-up before the joint-attention blocks, rare
semantics clearly emerge in MM-DiT's outputs. Furthermore, our results
generalize effectively across text-to-vision tasks, including text-to-image,
text-to-video, and text-driven image editing. Our work invites generative
models to reveal the semantics that users intend, once hidden yet ready to
surface.

TL;DR: 提出一个游戏化的可解释AI系统，用于咖啡消费领域的道德决策，结合康德主义和功利主义伦理框架提供实时解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帮助消费者在购买咖啡时做出更符合伦理的决策，通过结合不同伦理框架的解释来增强决策的透明度和道德意识。

Method: 系统包含六个回合，每回合三个选项。使用两个符号引擎：康德主义模块检测规则违反（如童工、毁林风险等），功利主义模块通过多标准聚合对属性（价格、碳排放、透明度等）进行评分。元解释器在康德主义与功利主义不一致时，以0.2的遗憾界限切换到道德清洁且福利损失小的选项。

Result: 开发了结构化配置（属性模式、认证映射、权重、规则集）、可审计的策略轨迹和交互式用户界面。

Conclusion: 该系统成功整合了不同伦理框架，为消费者提供了透明、可解释的道德决策支持工具。

Abstract: We present a gamified explainable AI (XAI) system for ethically aware
consumer decision-making in the coffee domain. Each session comprises six
rounds with three options per round. Two symbolic engines provide real-time
reasons: a Kantian module flags rule violations (e.g., child labor,
deforestation risk without shade certification, opaque supply chains, unsafe
decaf), and a utilitarian module scores options via multi-criteria aggregation
over normalized attributes (price, carbon, water, transparency, farmer income
share, taste/freshness, packaging, convenience). A meta-explainer with a regret
bound (0.2) highlights Kantian--utilitarian (mis)alignment and switches to a
deontically clean, near-parity option when welfare loss is small. We release a
structured configuration (attribute schema, certification map, weights, rule
set), a policy trace for auditability, and an interactive UI.

TL;DR: QRLLM是一个用于评估LLM在多轮对话中产生灾难性响应风险的认证框架，通过马尔可夫过程建模对话分布，提供统计保证的风险边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法充分揭示LLM在对话中的灾难性风险，因为它们依赖固定攻击提示序列、缺乏统计保证且无法扩展到多轮对话的广阔空间。

Method: 将多轮对话建模为查询序列的概率分布，使用马尔可夫过程在查询图上表示对话流，通过置信区间量化灾难性风险，定义了随机节点、图路径、自适应拒绝等实用分布。

Result: 实验表明这些分布能够揭示前沿模型中的显著灾难性风险，最差模型的认证下界高达70%。

Conclusion: 前沿LLMs迫切需要改进安全训练策略，以降低在多轮对话中产生灾难性响应的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce catastrophic responses in
conversational settings that pose serious risks to public safety and security.
Existing evaluations often fail to fully reveal these vulnerabilities because
they rely on fixed attack prompt sequences, lack statistical guarantees, and do
not scale to the vast space of multi-turn conversations. In this work, we
propose QRLLM, a novel, principled Certification framework for Catastrophic
risks in multi-turn Conversation for LLMs that bounds the probability of an LLM
generating catastrophic responses under multi-turn conversation distributions
with statistical guarantees. We model multi-turn conversations as probability
distributions over query sequences, represented by a Markov process on a query
graph whose edges encode semantic similarity to capture realistic
conversational flow, and quantify catastrophic risks using confidence
intervals. We define several inexpensive and practical distributions: random
node, graph path, adaptive with rejection. Our results demonstrate that these
distributions can reveal substantial catastrophic risks in frontier models,
with certified lower bounds as high as 70\% for the worst model, highlighting
the urgent need for improved safety training strategies in frontier LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有创造力评估框架分散且缺乏理论基础，需要建立基于社会科学理论的统一评估标准来衡量基础模型的创造力。

Method: 引入C^2-Eval基准，区分收敛性创造力（有约束解决方案的任务）和发散性创造力（开放式任务），使用有用性、原创性和惊喜度三个细粒度标准进行评估。

Result: 通过对领先专有和开源模型的广泛实验，分析了它们在创造力能力上的权衡，揭示了当前基础模型在追求创造性机器思维方面的优势和挑战。

Conclusion: C^2-Eval是检验创造性AI发展格局的有效工具，能够全面评估基础模型的创造力表现。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of foundation models (FMs) has expanded their capabilities
far beyond conventional tasks. Creativity, long regarded as a hallmark of human
intelligence and a driver of innovation, is now increasingly recognized as a
critical dimension of machine intelligence in the era of generative FMs,
complementing traditional measures of accuracy. However, existing evaluation
frameworks for creativity remain fragmented, relying on ad hoc metrics not
firmly grounded in established theories. To address this gap, we introduce
C^2-Eval, a holistic benchmark for unified assessment of creativity in FMs.
C^2-Eval distinguishes between two complementary forms of creativity:
convergent creativity, where tasks admit constrained solutions (e.g., code
generation), and divergent creativity, where tasks are open-ended (e.g.,
storytelling). It evaluates both dimensions using fine-grained criteria derived
from social-science theory, focusing on Usefulness, Originality, and Surprise
(U-O-S). Through extensive experiments on leading proprietary and open-source
models, we analyze trade-offs in their creative capabilities. Our results
highlight both the strengths and challenges of current FMs in pursuing a
creative machine mind, showing that C^2-Eval is an effective lens for examining
the evolving landscape of creative AI.

<details>

Motivation: 基础天气模型缺乏语言推理能力，而大型语言模型无法处理高维气象数据，需要桥接这一差距以支持交互式科学工作流。

Method: 构建了ZephyrusWorld代码环境，包含WeatherBench 2数据集接口、地理查询、天气预报和气候模拟工具；设计了Zephyrus多轮对话代理，通过迭代分析和反馈循环处理天气数据；创建了ZephyrusBench基准测试。

Result: 在基准测试中，Zephyrus代理比纯文本基线模型在正确率上高出最多35个百分点；但在更困难任务上表现相似，表明基准测试具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了数值天气模型和语言模型的能力，为天气科学交互式工作流提供了新方向，但更复杂任务仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Foundation models for weather science are pre-trained on vast amounts of
structured numerical data and outperform traditional weather forecasting
systems. However, these models lack language-based reasoning capabilities,
limiting their utility in interactive scientific workflows. Large language
models (LLMs) excel at understanding and generating text but cannot reason
about high-dimensional meteorological datasets. We bridge this gap by building
a novel agentic framework for weather science. Our framework includes a Python
code-based environment for agents (ZephyrusWorld) to interact with weather
data, featuring tools like an interface to WeatherBench 2 dataset, geoquerying
for geographical masks from natural language, weather forecasting, and climate
simulation capabilities. We design Zephyrus, a multi-turn LLM-based weather
agent that iteratively analyzes weather datasets, observes results, and refines
its approach through conversational feedback loops. We accompany the agent with
a new benchmark, ZephyrusBench, with a scalable data generation pipeline that
constructs diverse question-answer pairs across weather-related tasks, from
basic lookups to advanced forecasting, extreme event detection, and
counterfactual reasoning. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the strong
performance of Zephyrus agents over text-only baselines, outperforming them by
up to 35 percentage points in correctness. However, on harder tasks, Zephyrus
performs similarly to text-only baselines, highlighting the challenging nature
of our benchmark and suggesting promising directions for future work.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
AI agents that automate multiple stages of the data science workflow by
integrating planning, tool use, and multimodal reasoning across text, code,
tables, and visuals. This survey presents the first comprehensive,
lifecycle-aligned taxonomy of data science agents, systematically analyzing and
mapping forty-five systems onto the six stages of the end-to-end data science
process: business understanding and data acquisition, exploratory analysis and
visualization, feature engineering, model building and selection,
interpretation and explanation, and deployment and monitoring. In addition to
lifecycle coverage, we annotate each agent along five cross-cutting design
dimensions: reasoning and planning style, modality integration, tool
orchestration depth, learning and alignment methods, and trust, safety, and
governance mechanisms. Beyond classification, we provide a critical synthesis
of agent capabilities, highlight strengths and limitations at each stage, and
review emerging benchmarks and evaluation practices. Our analysis identifies
three key trends: most systems emphasize exploratory analysis, visualization,
and modeling while neglecting business understanding, deployment, and
monitoring; multimodal reasoning and tool orchestration remain unresolved
challenges; and over 90% lack explicit trust and safety mechanisms. We conclude
by outlining open challenges in alignment stability, explainability,
governance, and robust evaluation frameworks, and propose future research
directions to guide the development of robust, trustworthy, low-latency,
transparent, and broadly accessible data science agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域快速增长的临床AI堆栈缺乏标准化的日志记录协议，难以追踪AI模型的使用情况、性能表现和不良事件，阻碍了对医疗AI的监控和改进。

Method: 设计MedLog协议，包含九个核心字段：header、model、user、target、inputs、artifacts、outputs、outcomes和feedback，支持风险采样、生命周期感知的保留策略和写后缓存。

Result: MedLog提供了一个结构化和一致的模型活动记录框架，能够捕获复杂、代理或多阶段工作流程的详细追踪。

Conclusion: MedLog能够促进医疗AI的持续监控、审计和迭代改进，为新型数字流行病学奠定基础。

Abstract: Modern computer systems often rely on syslog, a simple, universal protocol
that records every critical event across heterogeneous infrastructure. However,
healthcare's rapidly growing clinical AI stack has no equivalent. As hospitals
rush to pilot large language models and other AI-based clinical decision
support tools, we still lack a standard way to record how, when, by whom, and
for whom these AI models are used. Without that transparency and visibility, it
is challenging to measure real-world performance and outcomes, detect adverse
events, or correct bias or dataset drift. In the spirit of syslog, we introduce
MedLog, a protocol for event-level logging of clinical AI. Any time an AI model
is invoked to interact with a human, interface with another algorithm, or act
independently, a MedLog record is created. This record consists of nine core
fields: header, model, user, target, inputs, artifacts, outputs, outcomes, and
feedback, providing a structured and consistent record of model activity. To
encourage early adoption, especially in low-resource settings, and minimize the
data footprint, MedLog supports risk-based sampling, lifecycle-aware retention
policies, and write-behind caching; detailed traces for complex, agentic, or
multi-stage workflows can also be captured under MedLog. MedLog can catalyze
the development of new databases and software to store and analyze MedLog
records. Realizing this vision would enable continuous surveillance, auditing,
and iterative improvement of medical AI, laying the foundation for a new form
of digital epidemiology.

Method: 建立统一基准FaithCoT-Bench，包含FINE-CoT数据集（专家标注的1000+轨迹），将不忠实检测制定为判别决策问题，系统评估11种检测方法。

Result: 揭示了现有方法的优缺点，发现在知识密集型领域和更先进模型中的检测挑战更大。

Conclusion: FaithCoT-Bench是首个针对实例级CoT忠实性的综合基准，为LLM中更可解释和可信的推理研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting to improve problem-solving and provide seemingly transparent
explanations. However, growing evidence shows that CoT often fail to faithfully
represent the underlying reasoning process, raising concerns about their
reliability in high-risk applications. Although prior studies have focused on
mechanism-level analyses showing that CoTs can be unfaithful, they leave open
the practical challenge of deciding whether a specific trajectory is faithful
to the internal reasoning of the model. To address this gap, we introduce
FaithCoT-Bench, a unified benchmark for instance-level CoT unfaithfulness
detection. Our framework establishes a rigorous task formulation that
formulates unfaithfulness detection as a discriminative decision problem, and
provides FINE-CoT (Faithfulness instance evaluation for Chain-of-Thought), an
expert-annotated collection of over 1,000 trajectories generated by four
representative LLMs across four domains, including more than 300 unfaithful
instances with fine-grained causes and step-level evidence. We further conduct
a systematic evaluation of eleven representative detection methods spanning
counterfactual, logit-based, and LLM-as-judge paradigms, deriving empirical
insights that clarify the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches and
reveal the increased challenges of detection in knowledge-intensive domains and
with more advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, FaithCoT-Bench
establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for instance-level CoT
faithfulness, setting a solid basis for future research toward more
interpretable and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite huge advances, LLMs still lack convenient and reliable methods to
quantify the uncertainty in their responses, making them difficult to trust in
high-stakes applications. One of the simplest approaches to eliciting more
accurate answers is to select the mode of many responses, a technique known as
ensembling. In this work, we expand on typical ensembling approaches by looking
at ensembles with a variable voting threshold. We introduce a theoretical
framework for question answering and show that, by permitting ensembles to
"abstain" from providing an answer when the dominant response falls short of
the threshold, it is possible to dramatically increase the trustworthiness of
the remaining answers. From this framework, we derive theoretical results as
well as report experimental results on two problem domains: arithmetic problem
solving and clinical-note question-answering. In both domains, we observe that
large gains in answer trustworthiness can be achieved using highly restrictive
voting ensembles, while incurring relatively modest reductions in response
yield and accuracy. Due to this quality, voting ensembles may be particularly
useful in applications - such as healthcare and data annotation - that require
a high degree of certainty but which may not require that every question
receive an automated answer.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LEGO-IRT是一个用于高效评估大语言模型的数据驱动框架，支持二进制和连续评分指标，通过因子化架构建模结构知识，仅需3%的评估项就能获得稳定的能力估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于项目反应理论(IRT)的评估方法存在显著局限性：仅限于二进制正确性指标，无法处理生成任务中的连续分数，且仅针对单一基准，忽略了跨不同指标或基准的相关性等有价值的结构知识。

Method: LEGO-IRT采用统一灵活的设计，原生支持二进制和连续评估指标，引入因子化架构将模型能力估计分解为通用组件和结构特定组件（如按指标或按基准），显式建模和利用结构知识。

Result: 在涉及70个LLM和5个基准的广泛实验中，LEGO-IRT仅使用总评估项的3%就实现了稳定的能力估计。融入结构知识可将估计误差降低高达10%，且估计的潜在能力与人类偏好更一致。

Conclusion: LEGO-IRT框架通过支持多种评分指标和利用结构知识，显著提高了LLM评估的数据效率，为更高效、准确的模型评估提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on comprehensive benchmarks is a
cornerstone of their development, yet it's often computationally and
financially prohibitive. While Item Response Theory (IRT) offers a promising
path toward data-efficient evaluation by disentangling model capability from
item difficulty, existing IRT-based methods are hampered by significant
limitations. They are typically restricted to binary correctness metrics,
failing to natively handle the continuous scores used in generative tasks, and
they operate on single benchmarks, ignoring valuable structural knowledge like
correlations across different metrics or benchmarks. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce LEGO-IRT, a unified and flexible framework for
data-efficient LLM evaluation. LEGO-IRT's novel design natively supports both
binary and continuous evaluation metrics. Moreover, it introduces a factorized
architecture to explicitly model and leverage structural knowledge, decomposing
model ability estimates into a general component and structure-specific (e.g.,
per-metric or per-benchmark) components. Through extensive experiments
involving $70$ LLMs across $5$ benchmarks, we show that LEGO-IRT achieves
stable capability estimates using just $3\%$ of the total evaluation items. We
demonstrate that incorporating structural knowledge reduces estimation error by
up to $10\%$ and reveal that the latent abilities estimated by our framework
may align more closely with human preferences.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型内部的情感表示，发现LLMs在神经网络中形成了清晰的情感几何结构，这种情感信号在网络中层达到峰值，具有可塑性和持久性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管研究证实LLMs能够模拟情感智能，但其内部情感机制仍未被充分探索。本文旨在探究现代LLMs中潜在的情感表示，包括情感在神经网络中如何、在哪里以及持续多长时间被编码。

Method: 构建了一个包含约40万条话语的大规模Reddit语料库，通过分类、重写和合成生成平衡了七种基本情感。使用轻量级"探针"从各种Qwen3和LLaMA模型的隐藏层读取信息而不改变其参数。

Result: 发现LLMs形成了定义良好的内部情感几何结构，随着模型规模增大而更加清晰，显著优于零样本提示。情感信号不是最终层现象，而是早期出现并在网络中层达到峰值。内部状态具有可塑性（可通过简单系统提示影响）和持久性（初始情感基调在数百个后续标记中仍可检测）。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更透明和对齐的AI系统提供了关键见解，贡献了数据集、开源探针工具包和LLMs内部情感景观的详细图谱。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to navigate the
nuances of human emotion. While research confirms that LLMs can simulate
emotional intelligence, their internal emotional mechanisms remain largely
unexplored. This paper investigates the latent emotional representations within
modern LLMs by asking: how, where, and for how long is emotion encoded in their
neural architecture? To address this, we introduce a novel, large-scale Reddit
corpus of approximately 400,000 utterances, balanced across seven basic
emotions through a multi-stage process of classification, rewriting, and
synthetic generation. Using this dataset, we employ lightweight "probes" to
read out information from the hidden layers of various Qwen3 and LLaMA models
without altering their parameters. Our findings reveal that LLMs develop a
surprisingly well-defined internal geometry of emotion, which sharpens with
model scale and significantly outperforms zero-shot prompting. We demonstrate
that this emotional signal is not a final-layer phenomenon but emerges early
and peaks mid-network. Furthermore, the internal states are both malleable
(they can be influenced by simple system prompts) and persistent, as the
initial emotional tone remains detectable for hundreds of subsequent tokens. We
contribute our dataset, an open-source probing toolkit, and a detailed map of
the emotional landscape within LLMs, offering crucial insights for developing
more transparent and aligned AI systems. The code and dataset are open-sourced.

TL;DR: 提出Moral Anchor System (MAS)框架，通过实时贝叶斯推理、LSTM预测和人类中心治理层来检测、预测和缓解AI系统中的价值漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI作为超级助手的崛起带来了价值对齐的担忧，特别是价值漂移风险——AI系统可能因环境变化、学习动态或意外优化而偏离人类伦理和意图，导致效率低下或伦理违规。

Method: MAS结合实时贝叶斯推理监控价值状态、LSTM网络预测漂移趋势，以及人类中心治理层进行自适应干预。强调低延迟响应（<20毫秒），通过监督微调减少误报和警报疲劳。

Result: 在模拟实验中，MAS能将价值漂移事件减少80%以上，保持高检测准确率（85%）和低误报率（0.08%）。与目标错位代理的严格实验验证了其可扩展性和响应性。

Conclusion: MAS的创新在于其预测性和自适应性，与静态对齐方法形成对比。贡献包括MAS架构、强调速度和可用性的实证结果、跨领域应用洞察以及开源代码。

Abstract: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) as super-capable assistants has
transformed productivity and decision-making across domains. Yet, this
integration raises critical concerns about value alignment - ensuring AI
behaviors remain consistent with human ethics and intentions. A key risk is
value drift, where AI systems deviate from aligned values due to evolving
contexts, learning dynamics, or unintended optimizations, potentially leading
to inefficiencies or ethical breaches. We propose the Moral Anchor System
(MAS), a novel framework to detect, predict, and mitigate value drift in AI
agents. MAS combines real-time Bayesian inference for monitoring value states,
LSTM networks for forecasting drift, and a human-centric governance layer for
adaptive interventions. It emphasizes low-latency responses (<20 ms) to prevent
breaches, while reducing false positives and alert fatigue via supervised
fine-tuning with human feedback. Our hypothesis: integrating probabilistic
drift detection, predictive analytics, and adaptive governance can reduce value
drift incidents by 80 percent or more in simulations, maintaining high
detection accuracy (85 percent) and low false positive rates (0.08
post-adaptation). Rigorous experiments with goal-misaligned agents validate
MAS's scalability and responsiveness. MAS's originality lies in its predictive
and adaptive nature, contrasting static alignment methods. Contributions
include: (1) MAS architecture for AI integration; (2) empirical results
prioritizing speed and usability; (3) cross-domain applicability insights; and
(4) open-source code for replication.

TL;DR: SPOGW是一种新的基于分数的偏好方法，通过组间比较直接操作基数奖励信号，在连续空间中进行更高效稳定的优化，用于自动化生成和优化代理工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理工作流设计需要大量人工努力，限制了可扩展性和泛化性。当前自动化方法受限于离散优化技术，存在表示能力有限、适应性不足、可扩展性弱和成对比较范式等问题。

Method: 提出SPOGW方法，结合迭代离线GRPO(ioGRPO)和优势掩码KL散度(mKL)，通过强调策略响应的优势区域来调节训练更新。

Result: 在五个基准数据集（数学推理、编码和问答）上，SPOGW匹配或超越了当前最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: SPOGW为代理工作流的自动生成和优化提供了一种可行且前瞻的方法论。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant capabilities in
addressing challenging problems throughout various fields, often through the
use of agentic workflows that adhere to structured instructions and multi-step
procedures. However, designing such workflows demands substantial manual
effort, posing challenges to scalability and generalizability. Recent studies
have aimed to minimize the human intervention needed for their construction,
leading to advances in automated techniques for optimizing agentic workflows.
However, current approaches are often constrained by their limited
representational capacity, insufficient adaptability, weak scalability, and
pairwise comparison paradigm -- issues that stem primarily from a dependence on
discrete optimization techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
new score-based preference approach, refereed as SPOGW, which operates directly
on cardinal reward signals through group-wise comparison and enables more
efficient and stable optimization in a continuous space. SPOGW incorporates
Iterative offline GRPO (ioGRPO) with advantage-masked KL divergence (mKL),
which regulates training update by placing greater emphasis on the advantageous
regions of the policy response. In five benchmark datasets covering
mathematical reasoning, coding, and question answering, SPOGW matches or
exceeds the performance of current state-of-the-art approaches, presenting a
viable and forward-looking methodology for automated generation and
optimization of agentic workflows.

TL;DR: DLLM是一个基于扩散模型的LLM框架，用于网络教育系统中的认知诊断，通过构建独立子图、关系增强对齐和两阶段去噪扩散模块，有效处理数据不平衡和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络教育系统(WIES)中的认知诊断面临异构噪声交互、数据不平衡和LLM对结构化数据处理困难等挑战，特别是在开放环境中不断产生大量响应日志加剧了这些问题。

Method: DLLM首先基于响应正确性构建独立子图，应用关系增强对齐模块缓解数据不平衡；然后融合子图表示并与LLM增强的语义表示对齐；采用两阶段去噪扩散模块（无条件去噪和基于图引导的条件去噪）消除噪声并辅助结构表示对齐。

Result: 在三个公开网络教育平台数据集上的实验表明，DLLM在不同噪声水平下均实现了最优预测性能，证明了其噪声鲁棒性并有效利用了LLM的语义知识。

Conclusion: DLLM框架通过结合扩散模型和LLM，成功解决了网络教育系统中认知诊断的噪声鲁棒性问题，为处理大规模异构教育数据提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cognitive diagnostics in the Web-based Intelligent Education System (WIES)
aims to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts from heterogeneous,
noisy interactions. Recent work has tried to utilize Large Language Models
(LLMs) for cognitive diagnosis, yet LLMs struggle with structured data and are
prone to noise-induced misjudgments. Specially, WIES's open environment
continuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs,
exacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional
educational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a
Diffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first
constructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies
relation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two
subgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived,
semantically augmented representations. Importantly, before each alignment
step, DLLM employs a two-stage denoising diffusion module to eliminate
intrinsic noise while assisting structural representation alignment.
Specifically, unconditional denoising diffusion first removes erroneous
information, followed by conditional denoising diffusion based on graph-guided
to eliminate misleading information. Finally, the noise-robust representation
that integrates semantic knowledge and structural information is fed into
existing cognitive diagnosis models for prediction. Experimental results on
three publicly available web-based educational platform datasets demonstrate
that our DLLM achieves optimal predictive performance across varying noise
levels, which demonstrates that DLLM achieves noise robustness while
effectively leveraging semantic knowledge from LLM.

Motivation: 现有UI图像转代码基准测试在数据多样性和评估可靠性方面存在局限，需要更真实、多样化的数据集和更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 构建WebRenderBench大规模基准测试集，提出基于渲染页面的布局样式一致性评估指标，并开发ALISA方法将该指标作为强化学习奖励信号进行训练。

Result: ALISA显著提升了生成性能，在多个指标上达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过更客观可靠的UI质量评估和强化学习训练，有效提升了UI图像到代码转换的质量和性能。

Abstract: Automating the conversion of UI images into web code is a critical task for
front-end development and rapid prototyping. Advances in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have made WebUI-to-Code increasingly feasible, yet
existing benchmarks remain limited in data diversity and evaluation
reliability. To address these issues, we present WebRenderBench, a large-scale
benchmark of 22.5k webpages collected from real-world portal sites, offering
greater diversity, complexity, and realism than prior benchmarks. We further
propose a novel evaluation metric that measures layout and style consistency
from the final rendered pages. Unlike vision-based methods that rely on costly
LLM reasoning or structure-based comparisons vulnerable to noise and asymmetry,
our approach enables more efficient, objective, and reliable UI quality
assessment. Finally, we introduce the Automated Layout and Style Inspection
Agent (ALISA), which integrates this metric into reinforcement learning as a
reward signal to enhance training on crawled asymmetric webpages. Experiments
show that ALISA significantly boosts generation performance, achieving
state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics.

Motivation: 现有研究使用手动设计的元推理骨架结构，限制了适应查询特定需求的能力，且难以捕捉推理步骤间复杂的逻辑依赖关系。

Method: 提出AutoMR框架，使用有向无环图统一表示元推理骨架，基于AutoML思想自动搜索查询感知的骨架，设计动态骨架采样算法在推理时根据上下文扩展骨架。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果显示，AutoMR相比先前方法在推理性能上有显著提升。

Conclusion: AutoMR通过自动搜索查询感知的元推理骨架，能够更好地适应不同查询需求并捕捉复杂逻辑依赖，有效提升大语言模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Meta reasoning behaviors work as a skeleton to guide large language model
(LLM) reasoning, thus help to improve reasoning performance. However, prior
researches implement meta reasoning skeleton with manually designed structure,
limiting ability to adapt to query-specific requirement and capture intricate
logical dependency among reasoning steps. To deal with the challenges, we
represent meta reasoning skeleton with directed acyclic graph (DAG) to unify
skeletons proposed in prior works and model intricate logical dependency. Then
we propose AutoMR, a framework that searches for query-aware meta reasoning
skeleton automatically inspired by automated machine learning (AutoML).
Specifically, we construct search space based on DAG representation of skeleton
and then formulate the search problem. We design a dynamic skeleton sampling
algorithm by expanding meta reasoning skeleton along with reasoning context at
inference time. This algorithm can derive any meta reasoning skeleton in search
space efficiently and adapt skeleton to evolving base reasoning context, thus
enable efficient query-aware skeleton search. We conduct experiments on
extensive benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that AutoMR achieves
better reasoning performance than previous works broadly.

TL;DR: 研究表明推理模型中的等待标记(token wait)是复杂推理行为的重要标志，本文通过训练交叉编码器和引入潜在归因技术，识别出影响等待标记概率的关键特征，这些特征与不同类型的推理模式相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解为什么模型会决定以特定方式推理，特别是等待标记背后的机制，这对于理解推理模型为何有效至关重要。当前对这种复杂行为的理解有限。

Method: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B及其基础版本的多个层训练交叉编码器，引入潜在归因技术来定位影响等待标记概率的特征集。

Result: 识别出一小组与促进/抑制等待标记概率相关的特征，这些特征确实与推理过程相关，并产生不同类型的推理模式，如从头重启、回忆先验知识、表达不确定性和双重检查。

Conclusion: 模型在等待标记之前的潜在状态包含调节后续推理过程的相关信息，识别出的特征揭示了推理模型中的不同推理模式和行为机制。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that a significant driver of performance in reasoning
models is their ability to reason and self-correct. A distinctive marker in
these reasoning traces is the token wait, which often signals reasoning
behavior such as backtracking. Despite being such a complex behavior, little is
understood of exactly why models do or do not decide to reason in this
particular manner, which limits our understanding of what makes a reasoning
model so effective. In this work, we address the question whether model's
latents preceding wait tokens contain relevant information for modulating the
subsequent reasoning process. We train crosscoders at multiple layers of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B and its base version, and introduce a latent
attribution technique in the crosscoder setting. We locate a small set of
features relevant for promoting/suppressing wait tokens' probabilities.
Finally, through a targeted series of experiments analyzing max activating
examples and causal interventions, we show that many of our identified features
indeed are relevant for the reasoning process and give rise to different types
of reasoning patterns such as restarting from the beginning, recalling prior
knowledge, expressing uncertainty, and double-checking.

Method: MENTOR框架：混合策略专家导航进行令牌级推理优化，仅在关键决策点提供专家指导，实现有效且多样化的探索。

Result: 实验表明MENTOR能够捕捉专家策略本质而非表面模仿，实现高质量探索并获得优越整体性能。

Conclusion: 通过只在关键决策点提供专家指导，MENTOR框架解决了RLVR中探索质量的问题，实现了更好的推理能力提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a widely
adopted technique for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RLVR strongly depends on the capability
of base models. This issue arises because it requires the model to have
sufficient capability to perform high-quality exploration, which involves both
effectiveness and diversity. Unfortunately, existing methods address this issue
by imitating expert trajectories, which improve effectiveness but neglect
diversity. To address this, we argue that the expert only needs to provide
guidance only at critical decision points rather than the entire reasoning
path. Based on this insight, we propose MENTOR: Mixed-policy Expert Navigation
for Token-level Optimization of Reasoning, a framework that provides expert
guidance only at critical decision points to perform effective and diverse
exploration in RLVR. Extensive experiments show that MENTOR enables models
capture the essence of expert strategies rather than surface imitation, thereby
performing high-quality exploration and achieving superior overall performance.
Our code is available online.

Motivation: 推动这一演变的原因是旧有基准的饱和，其中高性能往往掩盖了根本性弱点。作者旨在记录从ImageNet时代的"知识测试"到当前为诊断系统性缺陷而设计的复杂推理基准的发展历程。

Method: 论文通过历史性回顾的方法，系统性地梳理了多模态AI评估的发展轨迹：从基础的知识测试，到应用逻辑和理解考试（如GQA、VCR），再到为现代MLLMs设计的专家级集成基准（如MMBench、SEED-Bench、MMMU）。

Result: 研究展示了评估方法从简单的识别任务向复杂推理过程评估的转变，揭示了当前评估越来越关注推理过程本身，并开始探索抽象、创造性和社会智能等未开发领域。

Conclusion: AI评估的叙事不仅仅是数据集的历史，而是一个持续对抗的过程，即设计更好的考试来重新定义我们创建真正智能系统的目标。

Abstract: This survey paper chronicles the evolution of evaluation in multimodal
artificial intelligence (AI), framing it as a progression of increasingly
sophisticated "cognitive examinations." We argue that the field is undergoing a
paradigm shift, moving from simple recognition tasks that test "what" a model
sees, to complex reasoning benchmarks that probe "why" and "how" it
understands. This evolution is driven by the saturation of older benchmarks,
where high performance often masks fundamental weaknesses. We chart the journey
from the foundational "knowledge tests" of the ImageNet era to the "applied
logic and comprehension" exams such as GQA and Visual Commonsense Reasoning
(VCR), which were designed specifically to diagnose systemic flaws such as
shortcut learning and failures in compositional generalization. We then survey
the current frontier of "expert-level integration" benchmarks (e.g., MMBench,
SEED-Bench, MMMU) designed for today's powerful multimodal large language
models (MLLMs), which increasingly evaluate the reasoning process itself.
Finally, we explore the uncharted territories of evaluating abstract, creative,
and social intelligence. We conclude that the narrative of AI evaluation is not
merely a history of datasets, but a continuous, adversarial process of
designing better examinations that, in turn, redefine our goals for creating
truly intelligent systems.

Abstract: Open Agent Specification (Agent Spec) is a declarative language that allows
AI agents and their workflows to be defined in a way that is compatible across
different AI frameworks, promoting portability and interoperability within AI
Agent frameworks.
  Agent Spec aims to resolve the challenges of fragmented agent development by
providing a common unified specification that allows AI agents to be designed
once and deployed across various frameworks, improving interoperability and
reusability, and reducing redundant development efforts. Additionally, Agent
Spec facilitates development tools and portability, allowing AI agents to be
defined independently of their execution environment and enabling teams to
exchange solutions without implementation-specific limitations.
  Agent Spec benefits four key groups: (i) Agent developers, who gain access to
a superset of reusable components and design patterns, enabling them to
leverage a broader range of functionalities; (ii) Agent framework and tool
developers, who can use Agent Spec as an interchange format and therefore
benefit from the support of other frameworks as well as other tools; (iii)
Researchers, who can achieve reproducible results and comparability,
facilitating more reliable and consistent outcomes; (iv) Enterprises, which
benefit from faster prototype-to-deployment, increased productivity, as well as
greater scalability and maintainability for their AI agent solutions. This
technical report provides an overview of the technical foundations of Agent
Spec, including motivation, benefits, and future developments.

and answer user queries by providing a shortest path from a start to a
destination (for instance, navigating from the lobby to a meeting room via the
hall and elevator). However, such context-dependent querying becomes incapable
as the environment grows much longer, motivating the need for incremental map
construction that builds a complete topological graph from stepwise
observations. We propose a framework for LLM-driven construction and map
repair, designed to detect, localize, and correct structural inconsistencies in
incrementally constructed navigation graphs. Central to our method is the
Version Control, which records the full history of graph edits and their source
observations, enabling fine-grained rollback, conflict tracing, and repair
evaluation. We further introduce an Edge Impact Score to prioritize
minimal-cost repairs based on structural reachability, path usage, and conflict
propagation. To properly evaluate our approach, we create a refined version of
the MANGO benchmark dataset by systematically removing non-topological actions
and inherent structural conflicts, providing a cleaner testbed for LLM-driven
construction and map repair. Our approach significantly improves map
correctness and robustness, especially in scenarios with entangled or chained
inconsistencies. Our results highlight the importance of introspective,
history-aware repair mechanisms for maintaining coherent spatial memory in LLM
agents.

TL;DR: COSMO-RL是一个混合强化学习框架，用于训练面向推理的大型多模态模型，通过多模态、多任务和多目标信号同时提升安全性和能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态环境中安全性的挑战：图像和文本结合可能绕过防护措施，单目标训练可能导致策略漂移，造成良性输入过度拒绝或危险输入不安全合规。

Method: 使用混合强化学习框架，在多模态、多任务和多目标信号下训练推理导向的大型多模态模型。

Result: COSMO-R1在提升安全性的同时保持甚至改善了多模态推理和指令跟随能力，对多模态越狱攻击表现出更强的鲁棒性，减少了不必要的拒绝。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种简单路径，让安全性和通用能力在大型多模态推理模型中共同发展，而不是在对齐过程中相互竞争。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) are moving into real applications,
where they must be both useful and safe. Safety is especially challenging in
multimodal settings: images and text can be combined to bypass guardrails, and
single objective training can cause policy drift that yields over-refusal on
benign inputs or unsafe compliance on risky ones. We present COSMO-RL, a mixed
reinforcement learning framework that trains reasoning oriented LMRMs under
multimodal, multitask, and multiobjective signals, and we release the resulting
model, COSMO-R1. Our approach aims to let safety and capability grow together
in one stable pipeline rather than competing during alignment. In experiments,
COSMO-R1 improves safety while maintaining-and often improving multimodal
reasoning and instruction following, shows stronger robustness to multimodal
jailbreaks, and reduces unnecessary refusals. The framework also transfers
across backbones with consistent gains. Ablations support the design choices,
indicating a simple path to advancing safety and general capability together in
LMRMs.

TL;DR: 提出了AgentRL框架，用于可扩展的多轮多任务智能体强化学习训练，通过异步生成-训练流水线和稳定算法显著提升LLM智能体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏可扩展的基础设施和稳定的训练算法，在多轮多任务设置中应用强化学习训练LLM智能体仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 基础设施方面：完全异步的生成-训练流水线、基于函数调用的统一API接口、容器化环境开发和集中控制器。算法方面：跨策略采样鼓励多轮探索，任务优势归一化稳定多任务训练。

Result: 在五个智能体任务上的实验显示，AgentRL显著优于GPT-5、Clause-Sonnet-4、DeepSeek-R1等开源LLM智能体。多任务训练结果与所有任务专用模型的最佳结果相当。

Conclusion: AgentRL框架为多轮多任务智能体强化学习提供了有效的解决方案，已在AutoGLM系统中采用并开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest
in building generalist agents that can learn through online interactions.
However, applying reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLM agents in
multi-turn, multi-task settings remains challenging due to lack of scalable
infrastructure and stable training algorithms. In this work, we present the
AgentRL framework for scalable multi-turn, multi-task agentic RL training. On
the infrastructure side, AgentRL features a fully-asynchronous
generation-training pipeline for efficient multi-turn RL. To support
heterogeneous environment development in multi-task RL, we design a unified
function-call based API interface, containerized environment development, and a
centralized controller. On the algorithm side, we propose cross-policy sampling
to encourage model exploration in multi-turn settings and task advantage
normalization to stabilize multi-task training. Experiments show that AgentRL,
trained on open LLMs across five agentic tasks, significantly outperforms
GPT-5, Clause-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-R1, and other open-source LLM agents.
Multi-task training with AgentRL matches the best results among all
task-specific models. AgentRL is open-sourced at
https://github.com/THUDM/AgentRL. The algorithm and framework are adopted in
building \textsc{\href{https://autoglm.zhipuai.cn}{AutoGLM}}.

*Mohsen Hariri,Amirhossein Samandar,Michael Hinczewski,Vipin Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个贝叶斯评估框架来替代Pass@k，通过后验估计模型成功概率和置信区间，提供更稳定的模型排名和透明的决策规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pass@k在有限试验次数和计算受限时会产生不稳定、误导性的排名结果，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 使用狄利克雷先验的贝叶斯框架，将评估结果建模为分类变量，提供后验均值和不确定性的闭式表达式，支持加权评分标准。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法比Pass@k及其变体具有更快的收敛速度和更好的排名稳定性，能在更小样本量下实现可靠比较。

Conclusion: 建议用基于后验的、计算高效的协议替代Pass@k，统一二元和非二元评估，同时明确不确定性。

Abstract: Pass$@k$ is widely used to report performance for LLM reasoning, but it often
yields unstable, misleading rankings, especially when the number of trials
(samples) is limited and compute is constrained. We present a principled
Bayesian evaluation framework that replaces Pass$@k$ and average accuracy over
$N$ trials (avg$@N$) with posterior estimates of a model's underlying success
probability and credible intervals, yielding stable rankings and a transparent
decision rule for differences. Evaluation outcomes are modeled as categorical
(not just 0/1) with a Dirichlet prior, giving closed-form expressions for the
posterior mean and uncertainty of any weighted rubric and enabling the use of
prior evidence when appropriate. Theoretically, under a uniform prior, the
Bayesian posterior mean is order-equivalent to average accuracy (Pass$@1$),
explaining its empirical robustness while adding principled uncertainty.
Empirically, in simulations with known ground-truth success rates and on
AIME'24/'25, HMMT'25, and BrUMO'25, the Bayesian/avg procedure achieves faster
convergence and greater rank stability than Pass$@k$ and recent variants,
enabling reliable comparisons at far smaller sample counts. The framework
clarifies when observed gaps are statistically meaningful (non-overlapping
credible intervals) versus noise, and it naturally extends to graded,
rubric-based evaluations. Together, these results recommend replacing Pass$@k$
for LLM evaluation and ranking with a posterior-based, compute-efficient
protocol that unifies binary and non-binary evaluation while making uncertainty
explicit. Code is available at https://mohsenhariri.github.io/bayes-kit

Abstract: Effective cross-functional coordination is essential for enhancing firm-wide
profitability, particularly in the face of growing organizational complexity
and scale. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially in
reinforcement learning (RL), offer promising avenues to address this
fundamental challenge. This paper proposes a unified multi-agent RL framework
tailored for joint optimization across distinct functional modules, exemplified
via coordinating inventory replenishment and personalized product
recommendation. We first develop an integrated theoretical model to capture the
intricate interplay between these functions and derive analytical benchmarks
that characterize optimal coordination. The analysis reveals synchronized
adjustment patterns across products and over time, highlighting the importance
of coordinated decision-making. Leveraging these insights, we design a novel
multi-timescale multi-agent RL architecture that decomposes policy components
according to departmental functions and assigns distinct learning speeds based
on task complexity and responsiveness. Our model-free multi-agent design
improves scalability and deployment flexibility, while multi-timescale updates
enhance convergence stability and adaptability across heterogeneous decisions.
We further establish the asymptotic convergence of the proposed algorithm.
Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
significantly improves profitability relative to siloed decision-making
frameworks, while the behaviors of the trained RL agents align closely with the
managerial insights from our theoretical model. Taken together, this work
provides a scalable, interpretable RL-based solution to enable effective
cross-functional coordination in complex business settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学多模态模型未能充分利用彩色眼底摄影和光学相干断层扫描之间的协同作用，且对定量生物标志物的解释能力有限。

Method: 采用三个核心模块：知识引导指令生成、CLIP风格OCT生物标志物对齐和监督指令微调，建立从定量到定性的诊断思维链。

Result: 仅使用LoRA微调7B参数的Qwen2骨干网络，GROK在报告质量和细粒度临床指标上均优于可比较的7B和32B基线模型，甚至超过OpenAI o3。

Conclusion: GROK通过建立定量到定性的诊断思维链，有效模拟临床推理过程，在眼科诊断任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold promise for integrating diverse
data modalities, but current medical adaptations such as LLaVA-Med often fail
to fully exploit the synergy between color fundus photography (CFP) and optical
coherence tomography (OCT), and offer limited interpretability of quantitative
biomarkers. We introduce GROK, a grounded multimodal large language model that
jointly processes CFP, OCT, and text to deliver clinician-grade diagnoses of
ocular and systemic disease. GROK comprises three core modules:
Knowledge-Guided Instruction Generation, CLIP-Style OCT-Biomarker Alignment,
and Supervised Instruction Fine-Tuning, which together establish a
quantitative-to-qualitative diagnostic chain of thought, mirroring real
clinical reasoning when producing detailed lesion annotations. To evaluate our
approach, we introduce the Grounded Ophthalmic Understanding benchmark, which
covers six disease categories and three tasks: macro-level diagnostic
classification, report generation quality, and fine-grained clinical assessment
of the generated chain of thought. Experiments show that, with only LoRA
(Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning of a 7B-parameter Qwen2 backbone, GROK
outperforms comparable 7B and 32B baselines on both report quality and
fine-grained clinical metrics, and even exceeds OpenAI o3. Code and data are
publicly available in the GROK repository.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在医疗决策基准上表现优异，但缺乏进行战略性和同理心咨询的能力，而这在真实临床场景中至关重要。

Method: 采用多智能体交互环境、双层奖励架构（分别优化临床决策和沟通技能）以及经验存储库，基于高质量历史轨迹进行策略学习。

Result: 在OpenAI的HealthBench和MAQuE基准测试中，Doctor-R1在通信质量、用户体验和任务准确性等多方面指标上显著超越最先进的开源专业LLM，且参数效率更高，甚至优于强大的专有模型。人类评估显示用户强烈偏好Doctor-R1生成的临床对话。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了AI医生代理的临床对话质量，证明了同时优化决策能力和沟通技能的重要性。

Abstract: The professionalism of a human doctor in outpatient service depends on two
core abilities: the ability to make accurate medical decisions and the medical
consultation skill to conduct strategic, empathetic patient inquiry. Existing
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable accuracy on medical
decision-making benchmarks. However, they often lack the ability to conduct the
strategic and empathetic consultation, which is essential for real-world
clinical scenarios. To address this gap, we propose Doctor-R1, an AI doctor
agent trained to master both of the capabilities by ask high-yield questions
and conduct strategic multi-turn inquiry to guide decision-making. Our
framework introduces three key components: a multi-agent interactive
environment, a two-tiered reward architecture that separately optimizes
clinical decision-making and communicative inquiry skills, and an experience
repository to ground policy learning in high-quality prior trajectories. We
evaluate Doctor-R1 on OpenAI's HealthBench and MAQuE, assessed across
multi-facet metrics, such as communication quality, user experience, and task
accuracy. Remarkably, Doctor-R1 surpasses state-of-the-art open-source
specialized LLMs by a substantial margin with higher parameter efficiency and
outperforms powerful proprietary models. Furthermore, the human evaluations
show a strong preference for Doctor-R1 to generate human-preferred clinical
dialogue, demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一个理论框架来评估LLM多智能体系统(LLM-MAS)相对于单智能体系统(LLM-SAS)的优势，发现任务深度(推理长度)和宽度(能力多样性)越大，LLM-MAS的优势越明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏系统性实验设计，限制了关于LLM-MAS优于LLM-SAS结论的强度和普适性，需要从任务复杂度的角度进行原则性理解。

Method: 提出理论框架，将任务特征化为深度(推理长度)和宽度(能力多样性)两个维度，理论分析多智能体辩论系统，并在不同深度和宽度的判别性和生成性任务中进行实证评估。

Result: 理论和实证结果表明，LLM-MAS相对于LLM-SAS的优势随着任务深度和宽度的增加而增加，且深度的影响更为显著。

Conclusion: 阐明了LLM-MAS在何时具有优势，为设计未来LLM-MAS方法和基准提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: Large language model multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) offer a promising paradigm
for harnessing collective intelligence to achieve more advanced forms of AI
behaviour. While recent studies suggest that LLM-MAS can outperform LLM
single-agent systems (LLM-SAS) on certain tasks, the lack of systematic
experimental designs limits the strength and generality of these conclusions.
We argue that a principled understanding of task complexity, such as the degree
of sequential reasoning required and the breadth of capabilities involved, is
essential for assessing the effectiveness of LLM-MAS in task solving. To this
end, we propose a theoretical framework characterising tasks along two
dimensions: depth, representing reasoning length, and width, representing
capability diversity. We theoretically examine a representative class of
LLM-MAS, namely the multi-agent debate system, and empirically evaluate its
performance in both discriminative and generative tasks with varying depth and
width. Theoretical and empirical results show that the benefit of LLM-MAS over
LLM-SAS increases with both task depth and width, and the effect is more
pronounced with respect to depth. This clarifies when LLM-MAS are beneficial
and provides a principled foundation for designing future LLM-MAS methods and
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"推测动作"的框架，通过使用更快的模型预测可能的动作，使多个步骤能够并行执行，从而显著降低智能体系统的端到端延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体在环境中的执行通常很慢，这阻碍了训练、评估和部署。例如，两个最先进的国际象棋智能体之间的对弈可能需要数小时。关键瓶颈在于智能体行为是按顺序展开的：每个动作都需要API调用，而这些调用可能很耗时。

Method: 受微处理器中的推测执行和LLM推理中的推测解码启发，提出推测动作框架。使用更快的模型预测可能的动作，使多个步骤能够并行执行。

Result: 在游戏、电子商务、网络搜索和操作系统环境中的评估显示，推测动作在下一个动作预测中实现了显著的准确性（高达55%），显著降低了端到端延迟。

Conclusion: 推测动作为在现实世界中部署低延迟智能体系统开辟了一条有前景的路径，性能可以通过更强的猜测模型、top-K动作预测、多步推测和不确定性感知优化来进一步提升。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in AI agents across industry and academia, their
execution in an environment is often slow, hampering training, evaluation, and
deployment. For example, a game of chess between two state-of-the-art agents
may take hours. A critical bottleneck is that agent behavior unfolds
sequentially: each action requires an API call, and these calls can be
time-consuming. Inspired by speculative execution in microprocessors and
speculative decoding in LLM inference, we propose speculative actions, a
lossless framework for general agentic systems that predicts likely actions
using faster models, enabling multiple steps to be executed in parallel. We
evaluate this framework across three agentic environments: gaming, e-commerce,
web search, and a "lossy" extension for an operating systems environment. In
all cases, speculative actions achieve substantial accuracy in next-action
prediction (up to 55%), translating into significant reductions in end-to-end
latency. Moreover, performance can be further improved through stronger
guessing models, top-K action prediction, multi-step speculation, and
uncertainty-aware optimization, opening a promising path toward deploying
low-latency agentic systems in the real world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进LLM智能体在陌生领域的表现通常需要昂贵的在线交互或专家数据集微调，这对闭源模型不实用且对开源模型成本高，还存在灾难性遗忘风险。离线轨迹提供了可重用知识，但原始轨迹长、嘈杂且与特定任务绑定。

Conclusion: JEF Hinter能够有效利用离线轨迹知识，为LLM智能体提供针对性指导，在多个基准测试中表现出色，为解决LLM智能体在陌生领域学习问题提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents perform well in sequential decision-making
tasks, but improving them on unfamiliar domains often requires costly online
interactions or fine-tuning on large expert datasets. These strategies are
impractical for closed-source models and expensive for open-source ones, with
risks of catastrophic forgetting. Offline trajectories offer reusable
knowledge, yet demonstration-based methods struggle because raw traces are
long, noisy, and tied to specific tasks. We present Just-in-time Episodic
Feedback Hinter (JEF Hinter), an agentic system that distills offline traces
into compact, context-aware hints. A zooming mechanism highlights decisive
steps in long trajectories, capturing both strategies and pitfalls. Unlike
prior methods, JEF Hinter leverages both successful and failed trajectories,
extracting guidance even when only failure data is available, while supporting
parallelized hint generation and benchmark-independent prompting. At inference,
a retriever selects relevant hints for the current state, providing targeted
guidance with transparency and traceability. Experiments on MiniWoB++,
WorkArena-L1, and WebArena-Lite show that JEF Hinter consistently outperforms
strong baselines, including human- and document-based hints.

Conclusion: 提出的BO-LLM算法能够有效提升文本分类准确性，同时通过利用LLM-based GP的预测不确定性来减少API调用次数。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely used to efficiently optimize
expensive black-box functions with limited evaluations. In this paper, we
investigate the use of BO for prompt engineering to enhance text classification
with Large Language Models (LLMs). We employ an LLM-powered Gaussian Process
(GP) as the surrogate model to estimate the performance of different prompt
candidates. These candidates are generated by an LLM through the expansion of a
set of seed prompts and are subsequently evaluated using an Upper Confidence
Bound (UCB) acquisition function in conjunction with the GP posterior. The
optimization process iteratively refines the prompts based on a subset of the
data, aiming to improve classification accuracy while reducing the number of
API calls by leveraging the prediction uncertainty of the LLM-based GP. The
proposed BO-LLM algorithm is evaluated on two datasets, and its advantages are
discussed in detail in this paper.

Motivation: 探索想象的计算目标，挑战传统认为想象是为了最大化奖励的观点，研究人类和AI内部世界模型的相似性。

Method: 使用心理网络分析方法，通过问卷调查评估想象生动性，构建人类和LLMs的想象网络，比较不同中心性指标的相关性。

Result: 人类想象网络显示不同中心性指标高度相关，而LLMs想象网络缺乏聚类且中心性指标相关性较低，表明两者内部世界模型存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种比较人类和AI内部生成表征的新方法，为开发类人想象的人工智能提供了见解。

Abstract: What is the computational objective of imagination? While classical
interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent
findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves
to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis
to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we
assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed
imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups
showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected
influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs
showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures
under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these
results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents.
Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated
representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like
imagination in artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 随着系统趋向超智能，需要形式化分析智能体在所有设计维度上的自我改进能力，特别是识别效用驱动修改与学习可靠性之间的结构性冲突。

Method: 采用五轴分解和决策层框架，将激励与学习行为分离，分析各轴在孤立条件下的表现。通过理论分析和数值实验验证。

Result: 发现当策略可达模型族的容量无限制增长时，效用理性的自我改变会使可学习任务变得不可学习。在标准假设下，各轴归结为相同的容量准则。

Conclusion: 提出了双门策略来保持可学习性，为安全自我修改提供了理论边界，防止效用驱动的修改破坏学习能力。

Abstract: As systems trend toward superintelligence, a natural modeling premise is that
agents can self-improve along every facet of their own design. We formalize
this with a five-axis decomposition and a decision layer, separating incentives
from learning behavior and analyzing axes in isolation. Our central result
identifies and introduces a sharp utility--learning tension, the structural
conflict in self-modifying systems whereby utility-driven changes that improve
immediate or expected performance can also erode the statistical preconditions
for reliable learning and generalization. Our findings show that
distribution-free guarantees are preserved iff the policy-reachable model
family is uniformly capacity-bounded; when capacity can grow without limit,
utility-rational self-changes can render learnable tasks unlearnable. Under
standard assumptions common in practice, these axes reduce to the same capacity
criterion, yielding a single boundary for safe self-modification. Numerical
experiments across several axes validate the theory by comparing destructive
utility policies against our proposed two-gate policies that preserve
learnability.

TL;DR: DRPO通过解耦正确与错误推理的奖励信号，解决了大型推理模型过度思考问题，在保持性能的同时显著减少推理长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型存在过度思考问题，生成冗长推理过程，增加计算成本和延迟。现有方法通过长度奖励促进简洁推理，但会导致性能显著下降。

Method: 提出DRPO框架，将正确推理的长度奖励信号与错误推理解耦，确保正确推理的奖励仅在正样本组内归一化，避免负样本干扰。通过优化正数据分布并整合到判别目标中实现。

Result: 在数学推理任务上显著优于六个高效推理基线方法。使用1.5B模型，在GSM8k数据集上实现77%长度减少，仅损失1.1%性能，而基线方法需要牺牲4.3%性能才能达到68%长度减少。

Conclusion: DRPO有效解决了推理模型过度思考问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅减少推理长度，且框架具有通用性，可整合其他偏好奖励。

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) driven by reinforcement learning
algorithms (e.g., GRPO) have achieved remarkable performance on challenging
reasoning tasks. However, these models suffer from overthinking, generating
unnecessarily long and redundant reasoning even for simple questions, which
substantially increases computational cost and response latency. While existing
methods incorporate length rewards to GRPO to promote concise reasoning, they
incur significant performance degradation. We identify the root cause: when
rewards for correct but long rollouts are penalized, GRPO's group-relative
advantage function can assign them negative advantages, actively discouraging
valid reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Decoupled Reward Policy
Optimization (DRPO), a novel framework that decouples the length-based learning
signal of correct rollouts from incorrect ones. DRPO ensures that reward
signals for correct rollouts are normalized solely within the positive group,
shielding them from interference by negative samples. The DRPO's objective is
grounded in integrating an optimized positive data distribution, which
maximizes length-based rewards under a KL regularization, into a discriminative
objective. We derive a closed-form solution for this distribution, enabling
efficient computation of the objective and its gradients using only on-policy
data and importance weighting. Of independent interest, this formulation is
general and can incorporate other preference rewards of positive data beyond
length. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate DRPO's
significant superiority over six efficient reasoning baselines. Notably, with a
1.5B model, our method achieves 77\% length reduction with only 1.1\%
performance loss on simple questions like GSM8k dataset, while the follow-up
baseline sacrifices 4.3\% for 68\% length reduction.

TL;DR: 将连续局部搜索(CIS)框架从布尔SAT扩展到有限域变量的通用CSP，提出FourierCSP方法，通过Walsh-Fourier变换将约束转换为紧凑的多线性多项式，无需辅助变量和内存密集型编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然冲突驱动子句学习SAT求解器取得了显著成功，但现代连续局部搜索求解器在某些SAT问题类别上也能达到高度竞争力。受此启发，将CIS框架扩展到通用CSP。

Method: 提出FourierCSP连续优化框架，将Walsh-Fourier变换推广到CSP，将多样化约束转换为紧凑的多线性多项式，利用电路输出概率进行高效评估和微分，采用具有理论保证的投影梯度优化方法。

Result: 在基准测试套件上的实证结果表明，FourierCSP具有可扩展性和竞争力，显著扩展了CIS技术能高效解决的问题类别。

Conclusion: FourierCSP成功将连续局部搜索技术扩展到通用约束满足问题，为CSP求解提供了新的高效方法。

Abstract: Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are fundamental in mathematics,
physics, and theoretical computer science. While conflict-driven clause
learning Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers have achieved remarkable success
and become the mainstream approach for Boolean satisfiability, recent advances
show that modern continuous local search (CLS) solvers can achieve highly
competitive results on certain classes of SAT problems. Motivated by these
advances, we extend the CLS framework from Boolean SAT to general CSP with
finite-domain variables and expressive constraints. We present FourierCSP, a
continuous optimization framework that generalizes the Walsh-Fourier transform
to CSP, allowing for transforming versatile constraints to compact multilinear
polynomials, thereby avoiding the need for auxiliary variables and
memory-intensive encodings. Our approach leverages efficient evaluation and
differentiation of the objective via circuit-output probability and employs a
projected gradient optimization method with theoretical guarantees. Empirical
results on benchmark suites demonstrate that FourierCSP is scalable and
competitive, significantly broadening the class of problems that can be
efficiently solved by CLS techniques.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MACI是一个多智能体辩论控制器，通过信息拨盘和行为拨盘分离信息与行为，使用调节器跟踪分歧、重叠、证据质量和论证质量，在收益平稳时停止辩论，实现预算感知、可测量且可证明终止的辩论控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体辩论存在计算资源浪费问题，包括使用固定对抗立场、无审议聚合或基于启发式停止。需要一种更高效的辩论控制机制。

Method: 引入MACI控制器，包含两个独立拨盘：信息拨盘按质量筛选证据，行为拨盘调度从探索到整合的争议性。调节器跟踪多个指标，使用跨家族LLM法官作为保守软权重和停止信号。

Result: 在临床诊断和新闻偏见任务中，MACI提高了准确性和校准度，同时减少了token使用，并将残余不确定性转化为精确的RAG检索计划。

Conclusion: MACI将辩论转变为预算感知、可测量且可证明终止的控制器，在多个任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent debate often wastes compute by using a fixed adversarial stance,
aggregating without deliberation, or stopping on heuristics. We introduce MACI,
an active controller with two independent dials that decouple information from
behavior: an information dial that gates evidence by quality, and a behavior
dial that schedules contentiousness from exploration to consolidation. A
moderator tracks disagreement, overlap, evidence quality, and argument quality,
and halts when gains plateau. We provide theory-lite guarantees for
nonincreasing dispersion and provable termination, with a budget-feasible
scheduler. Across clinical diagnosis and news-bias tasks, MACI improves
accuracy and calibration while reducing tokens, and converts residual
uncertainty into precision RAG plans that specify what to retrieve next. We use
a cross-family LLM judge (CRIT) as a conservative soft weight and stop signal,
validated for order invariance and judge-swap stability; stability depends on
using high-capability judges. MACI turns debate into a budget-aware,
measurable, and provably terminating controller.

TL;DR: TraitBasis是一个轻量级、模型无关的方法，用于系统性地压力测试AI智能体，通过控制用户特征向量来评估智能体在真实交互中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI智能体在标准评估中表现良好，但在用户行为变化（如不耐烦、不连贯或怀疑）时性能急剧下降，现有基准测试未能捕捉这种脆弱性。

Method: TraitBasis学习激活空间中可操控用户特征的方向，这些特征向量可以在推理时控制、缩放、组合和应用，无需微调或额外数据。

Result: 在τ-Trait基准测试中，前沿模型的性能平均下降2%-30%，显示了当前AI智能体对用户行为变化的鲁棒性不足。

Conclusion: TraitBasis作为一个简单、数据高效且可组合的工具，为构建在真实世界人类交互中保持可靠的AI智能体打开了大门。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in building conversational AI agents, robustness is
still largely untested. Small shifts in user behavior, such as being more
impatient, incoherent, or skeptical, can cause sharp drops in agent
performance, revealing how brittle current AI agents are. Today's benchmarks
fail to capture this fragility: agents may perform well under standard
evaluations but degrade spectacularly in more realistic and varied settings. We
address this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight,
model-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis
learns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits
(e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed,
and applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data. Using
TraitBasis, we extend $\tau$-Bench to $\tau$-Trait, where user behaviors are
altered via controlled trait vectors. We observe on average a 2%-30%
performance degradation on $\tau$-Trait across frontier models, highlighting
the lack of robustness of current AI agents to variations in user behavior.
Together, these results highlight both the critical role of robustness testing
and the promise of TraitBasis as a simple, data-efficient, and compositional
tool. By powering simulation-driven stress tests and training loops, TraitBasis
opens the door to building AI agents that remain reliable in the unpredictable
dynamics of real-world human interactions. We have open-sourced $\tau$-Trai
across four domains: airline, retail, telecom, and telehealth, so the community
can systematically QA their agents under realistic, behaviorally diverse
intents and trait scenarios: https://github.com/collinear-ai/tau-trait.

TL;DR: ChartAgent是一个新颖的代理框架，通过在图表空间域中执行视觉推理来解决未标注图表的理解问题，超越了依赖文本捷径的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态LLM在基于图表的视觉问答中表现良好，但在需要精确视觉解释而非依赖文本捷径的未标注图表上性能急剧下降。

Method: ChartAgent迭代地将查询分解为视觉子任务，通过专门的视觉工具（如绘制标注、裁剪区域、定位坐标轴）主动操作和交互图表图像。

Result: 在ChartBench和ChartX基准测试中达到最先进准确率，整体绝对增益达16.07%，在未标注数值密集型查询上增益达17.31%。

Conclusion: ChartAgent是首批使用工具增强多模态代理进行视觉基础推理的图表理解工作之一，在不同图表类型和推理复杂度上均表现优异。

Abstract: Recent multimodal LLMs have shown promise in chart-based visual question
answering, but their performance declines sharply on unannotated charts, those
requiring precise visual interpretation rather than relying on textual
shortcuts. To address this, we introduce ChartAgent, a novel agentic framework
that explicitly performs visual reasoning directly within the chart's spatial
domain. Unlike textual chain-of-thought reasoning, ChartAgent iteratively
decomposes queries into visual subtasks and actively manipulates and interacts
with chart images through specialized actions such as drawing annotations,
cropping regions (e.g., segmenting pie slices, isolating bars), and localizing
axes, using a library of chart-specific vision tools to fulfill each subtask.
This iterative reasoning process closely mirrors human cognitive strategies for
chart comprehension. ChartAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the
ChartBench and ChartX benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by up to 16.07%
absolute gain overall and 17.31% on unannotated, numerically intensive queries.
Furthermore, our analyses show that ChartAgent is (a) effective across diverse
chart types, (b) achieve the highest scores across varying visual and reasoning
complexity levels, and (c) serves as a plug-and-play framework that boosts
performance across diverse underlying LLMs. Our work is among the first to
demonstrate visually grounded reasoning for chart understanding using
tool-augmented multimodal agents.

Motivation: 解决LLM在定理自动形式化中的幻觉、语义不匹配和无法合成新定义等问题，推进数学自动发现和验证。

Method: 采用两阶段图思维过程：递归分解陈述为依赖图，然后从基础概念构建形式化；引入AriaScorer从Mathlib检索定义进行术语级基础验证。

Result: 在ProofNet上达到91.6%编译成功率和68.5%最终准确率；在FATE-X上44.0% vs 24.0%优于最佳基线；在同调猜想数据集上42.9%准确率而其他模型为0%。

Conclusion: Aria通过模拟人类推理过程和严格验证机制，显著提升了定理陈述自动形式化的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate auto-formalization of theorem statements is essential for advancing
automated discovery and verification of research-level mathematics, yet remains
a major bottleneck for LLMs due to hallucinations, semantic mismatches, and
their inability to synthesize new definitions. To tackle these issues, we
present Aria (Agent for Retrieval and Iterative Autoformalization), a system
for conjecture-level formalization in Lean that emulates human expert reasoning
via a two-phase Graph-of-Thought process: recursively decomposing statements
into a dependency graph and then constructing formalizations from grounded
concepts. To ensure semantic correctness, we introduce AriaScorer, a checker
that retrieves definitions from Mathlib for term-level grounding, enabling
rigorous and reliable verification. We evaluate Aria on diverse benchmarks. On
ProofNet, it achieves 91.6% compilation success rate and 68.5% final accuracy,
surpassing previous methods. On FATE-X, a suite of challenging algebra problems
from research literature, it outperforms the best baseline with 44.0% vs. 24.0%
final accuracy. On a dataset of homological conjectures, Aria reaches 42.9%
final accuracy while all other models score 0%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证VLM驾驶代理中规划是否真正由自然语言推理因果驱动，这一关键假设尚未得到验证。

Method: 构建DriveMind大规模驾驶VQA数据集，包含规划对齐的思维链；训练代表性VLM代理并进行信息消融实验和注意力分析。

Result: 移除先验信息导致规划分数大幅下降，而移除思维链仅产生微小变化；注意力分析显示规划主要关注先验而非推理过程。

Conclusion: 提出推理-规划解耦假说，认为训练产生的推理是附带产物而非因果中介；提供新数据集和诊断工具来评估未来模型的因果保真度。

Abstract: Vision-Language Model (VLM) driving agents promise explainable end-to-end
autonomy by first producing natural-language reasoning and then predicting
trajectory planning. However, whether planning is causally driven by this
reasoning remains a critical but unverified assumption. To investigate this, we
build DriveMind, a large-scale driving Visual Question Answering (VQA) corpus
with plan-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT), automatically generated from nuPlan.
Our data generation process converts sensors and annotations into structured
inputs and, crucially, separates priors from to-be-reasoned signals, enabling
clean information ablations. Using DriveMind, we train representative VLM
agents with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) and evaluate them with nuPlan's metrics. Our results, unfortunately,
indicate a consistent causal disconnect in reasoning-planning: removing
ego/navigation priors causes large drops in planning scores, whereas removing
CoT produces only minor changes. Attention analysis further shows that planning
primarily focuses on priors rather than the CoT. Based on this evidence, we
propose the Reasoning-Planning Decoupling Hypothesis, positing that the
training-yielded reasoning is an ancillary byproduct rather than a causal
mediator. To enable efficient diagnosis, we also introduce a novel,
training-free probe that measures an agent's reliance on priors by evaluating
its planning robustness against minor input perturbations. In summary, we
provide the community with a new dataset and a diagnostic tool to evaluate the
causal fidelity of future models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，使用LLM将自然语言规则和游戏轨迹转化为可执行的Python世界模型，然后结合蒙特卡洛树搜索等规划算法进行游戏，相比直接使用LLM生成动作具有可验证性、策略深度和泛化性优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用LLM直接生成游戏动作的方法存在明显缺陷：依赖模型脆弱的模式匹配能力，经常产生非法动作，策略深度不足。需要一种更可靠的方法来利用LLM的推理能力。

Method: 使用LLM将游戏规则和轨迹翻译成正式的Python代码世界模型，包含状态转换、合法动作枚举和终止检查函数。同时生成启发式价值函数和推理函数，结合MCTS等规划算法。

Result: 在10个不同游戏（4个为本文新创）上评估，其中5个完全观察、5个部分观察游戏。该方法在9个游戏中表现优于或匹配Gemini 2.5 Pro。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM用于数据到代码的翻译任务，结合经典规划算法，可以构建出更可靠、策略更深、泛化能力更强的游戏智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning abilities are increasingly being
applied to classical board and card games, but the dominant approach --
involving prompting for direct move generation -- has significant drawbacks. It
relies on the model's implicit fragile pattern-matching capabilities, leading
to frequent illegal moves and strategically shallow play. Here we introduce an
alternative approach: We use the LLM to translate natural language rules and
game trajectories into a formal, executable world model represented as Python
code. This generated model -- comprising functions for state transition, legal
move enumeration, and termination checks -- serves as a verifiable simulation
engine for high-performance planning algorithms like Monte Carlo tree search
(MCTS). In addition, we prompt the LLM to generate heuristic value functions
(to make MCTS more efficient), and inference functions (to estimate hidden
states in imperfect information games). Our method offers three distinct
advantages compared to directly using the LLM as a policy: (1) Verifiability:
The generated CWM serves as a formal specification of the game's rules,
allowing planners to algorithmically enumerate valid actions and avoid illegal
moves, contingent on the correctness of the synthesized model; (2) Strategic
Depth: We combine LLM semantic understanding with the deep search power of
classical planners; and (3) Generalization: We direct the LLM to focus on the
meta-task of data-to-code translation, enabling it to adapt to new games more
easily. We evaluate our agent on 10 different games, of which 4 are novel and
created for this paper. 5 of the games are fully observed (perfect
information), and 5 are partially observed (imperfect information). We find
that our method outperforms or matches Gemini 2.5 Pro in 9 out of the 10
considered games.

Motivation: 现有工作主要关注最终答案，而忽视了详细的工具使用轨迹，包括工具是否正确选择、参数化和排序。

Method: 构建TRAJECT-Bench基准，包含跨实际领域的高保真可执行工具，基于生产风格API的任务，以及合成不同广度（并行调用）和深度（相互依赖链）的轨迹。

Result: 揭示了失败模式，如相似工具混淆和参数盲选，以及工具多样性和轨迹长度下的扩展行为，发现了从短轨迹到中长轨迹过渡的瓶颈。

Conclusion: 提供了LLMs工具使用的可操作指导，强调了轨迹级诊断在全面评估工具使用能力中的重要性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents increasingly rely on tool use to
complete real-world tasks. While existing works evaluate the LLMs' tool use
capability, they largely focus on the final answers yet overlook the detailed
tool usage trajectory, i.e., whether tools are selected, parameterized, and
ordered correctly. We introduce TRAJECT-Bench, a trajectory-aware benchmark to
comprehensively evaluate LLMs' tool use capability through diverse tasks with
fine-grained evaluation metrics. TRAJECT-Bench pairs high-fidelity, executable
tools across practical domains with tasks grounded in production-style APIs,
and synthesizes trajectories that vary in breadth (parallel calls) and depth
(interdependent chains). Besides final accuracy, TRAJECT-Bench also reports
trajectory-level diagnostics, including tool selection and argument
correctness, and dependency/order satisfaction. Analyses reveal failure modes
such as similar tool confusion and parameter-blind selection, and scaling
behavior with tool diversity and trajectory length where the bottleneck of
transiting from short to mid-length trajectories is revealed, offering
actionable guidance for LLMs' tool use.

Conclusion: ContextNav展示了智能代理工作流在推进多模态上下文学习可扩展和鲁棒上下文构建方面的前景。

Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling them
to adapt to novel vision-language tasks from a few contextual examples.
However, existing ICL approaches face challenges in reconciling scalability
with robustness across diverse tasks and noisy contextual examples: manually
selecting examples produces clean contexts but is labor-intensive and
task-specific, while similarity-based retrieval improves scalability but could
introduce irrelevant or structurally inconsistent samples that degrade ICL
performance. To address these limitations, we propose ContextNav, the first
agentic framework that integrates the scalability of automated retrieval with
the quality and adaptiveness of human-like curation, enabling noise-robust and
dynamically optimized contextualization for multimodal ICL. ContextNav unifies
context management and noise-robust contextualization within a closed-loop
workflow driven by graph-based orchestration. Specifically, it builds a
resource-aware multimodal embedding pipeline, maintains a retrievable vector
database, and applies agentic retrieval and structural alignment to construct
noise-resilient contexts. An Operational Grammar Graph (OGG) further supports
adaptive workflow planning and optimization, enabling the agent to refine its
operational strategies based on downstream ICL feedback. Experimental results
demonstrate that ContextNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various datasets, underscoring the promise of agentic workflows for advancing
scalable and robust contextualization in multimodal ICL.

Conclusion: COSMIR通过结构化内存和固定工作流程，在保持分步阅读推理优势的同时，提高了忠实性、长距离聚合能力和可审计性。

Abstract: Reasoning over very long inputs remains difficult for large language models
(LLMs). Common workarounds either shrink the input via retrieval (risking
missed evidence), enlarge the context window (straining selectivity), or stage
multiple agents to read in pieces. In staged pipelines (e.g., Chain of Agents,
CoA), free-form summaries passed between agents can discard crucial details and
amplify early mistakes. We introduce COSMIR (Chain Orchestrated Structured
Memory for Iterative Reasoning), a chain-style framework that replaces ad hoc
messages with a structured memory. A Planner agent first turns a user query
into concrete, checkable sub-questions. worker agents process chunks via a
fixed micro-cycle: Extract, Infer, Refine, writing all updates to the shared
memory. A Manager agent then Synthesizes the final answer directly from the
memory. This preserves step-wise read-then-reason benefits while changing both
the communication medium (structured memory) and the worker procedure (fixed
micro-cycle), yielding higher faithfulness, better long-range aggregation, and
auditability. On long-context QA from the HELMET suite, COSMIR reduces
propagation-stage information loss and improves accuracy over a CoA baseline.

Motivation: 研究2048游戏变体的最优策略，特别是缩小棋盘尺寸后的版本，以探索游戏的可解性和最优策略的计算方法。

Method: 使用状态年龄（瓦片数字总和）对状态空间进行分区，年龄在状态和后续状态之间保持不变，仅通过环境随机响应增加2或4。基于年龄递减顺序枚举所有状态并计算状态值。

Result: 成功强求解2048-4x3变体，最优策略的期望得分约为50724.26（对于最常见的初始状态）。识别出可达状态数为1,152,817,492,752，后状态数为739,648,886,170。

Conclusion: 通过状态年龄分区技术，成功解决了2048-4x3变体，证明了该方法在求解此类随机游戏中的有效性。

Abstract: 2048 is a stochastic single-player game involving 16 cells on a 4 by 4 grid,
where a player chooses a direction among up, down, left, and right to obtain a
score by merging two tiles with the same number located in neighboring cells
along the chosen direction. This paper presents that a variant 2048-4x3 12
cells on a 4 by 3 board, one row smaller than the original, has been strongly
solved. In this variant, the expected score achieved by an optimal strategy is
about $50724.26$ for the most common initial states: ones with two tiles of
number 2. The numbers of reachable states and afterstates are identified to be
$1,152,817,492,752$ and $739,648,886,170$, respectively. The key technique is
to partition state space by the sum of tile numbers on a board, which we call
the age of a state. An age is invariant between a state and its successive
afterstate after any valid action and is increased two or four by stochastic
response from the environment. Therefore, we can partition state space by ages
and enumerate all (after)states of an age depending only on states with the
recent ages. Similarly, we can identify (after)state values by going along with
ages in decreasing order.

Conclusion: 认识论一致性要求我们对经验上无法区分的实体赋予相同的地位，这对意识理论和人工代理伦理框架具有重要影响。

Abstract: Rapid advances in artificial intelligence necessitate a re-examination of the
epistemological foundations upon which we attribute consciousness. As AI
systems increasingly mimic human behavior and interaction with high fidelity,
the concept of a "perfect mimic"-an entity empirically indistinguishable from a
human through observation and interaction-shifts from hypothetical to
technologically plausible. This paper argues that such developments pose a
fundamental challenge to the consistency of our mind-recognition practices.
Consciousness attributions rely heavily, if not exclusively, on empirical
evidence derived from behavior and interaction. If a perfect mimic provides
evidence identical to that of humans, any refusal to grant it equivalent
epistemic status must invoke inaccessible factors, such as qualia, substrate
requirements, or origin. Selectively invoking such factors risks a debilitating
dilemma: either we undermine the rational basis for attributing consciousness
to others (epistemological solipsism), or we accept inconsistent reasoning. I
contend that epistemic consistency demands we ascribe the same status to
empirically indistinguishable entities, regardless of metaphysical assumptions.
The perfect mimic thus acts as an epistemic mirror, forcing critical reflection
on the assumptions underlying intersubjective recognition in light of advancing
AI. This analysis carries significant implications for theories of
consciousness and ethical frameworks concerning artificial agents.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a primary indicator of large language models (LLMs)
intelligence. However, existing LLMs exhibit failures of robustness and
generalization. This paper attributes these deficiencies to spurious reasoning,
i.e., producing answers from superficial features. To address this challenge,
we propose the AdaR framework to enable adaptive reasoning, wherein models rely
on problem-solving logic to produce answers. AdaR synthesizes logically
equivalent queries by varying variable values, and trains models with RLVR on
these data to penalize spurious logic while encouraging adaptive logic. To
improve data quality, we extract the problem-solving logic from the original
query and generate the corresponding answer by code execution, then apply a
sanity check. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaR improves robustness
and generalization, achieving substantial improvement in mathematical reasoning
while maintaining high data efficiency. Analysis indicates that data synthesis
and RLVR function in a coordinated manner to enable adaptive reasoning in LLMs.
Subsequent analyses derive key design insights into the effect of critical
factors and the applicability to instruct LLMs. Our project is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedPAO是一个基于临床协议的代理框架，通过Plan-Act-Observe循环和专用工具来结构化临床数据，解决了LLM在医疗领域中的幻觉问题和规则遵循困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在临床数据结构化中的幻觉问题和无法遵循领域特定规则的局限性。

Method: 引入MedPAO代理框架，基于临床协议（如ABCDEF协议）进行接地操作，通过Plan-Act-Observe循环和专用工具分解报告结构化任务。

Result: MedPAO在概念分类关键子任务上达到0.96的F1分数，专家对最终结构化输出的平均评分为4.52/5，超越了仅依赖LLM的基线方法。

Conclusion: 协议驱动的方法为不透明的单体模型提供了可验证的替代方案，在临床数据结构化方面表现出卓越的可靠性。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structuring clinical data
is critically hindered by their tendency to hallucinate facts and their
inability to follow domain-specific rules. To address this, we introduce
MedPAO, a novel agentic framework that ensures accuracy and verifiable
reasoning by grounding its operation in established clinical protocols such as
the ABCDEF protocol for CXR analysis. MedPAO decomposes the report structuring
task into a transparent process managed by a Plan-Act-Observe (PAO) loop and
specialized tools. This protocol-driven method provides a verifiable
alternative to opaque, monolithic models. The efficacy of our approach is
demonstrated through rigorous evaluation: MedPAO achieves an F1-score of 0.96
on the critical sub-task of concept categorization. Notably, expert
radiologists and clinicians rated the final structured outputs with an average
score of 4.52 out of 5, indicating a level of reliability that surpasses
baseline approaches relying solely on LLM-based foundation models. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了QuantAgents多智能体金融系统，通过模拟交易和四个专业角色的协作，实现了近300%的三年总回报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体模型与真实基金公司存在显著差异，特别是在缺乏长期预测未来趋势的人类能力方面。

Method: 构建包含模拟交易分析师、风险控制分析师、市场新闻分析师和管理者四个角色的多智能体系统，通过会议协作，并在真实市场表现和模拟交易预测准确性两方面给予反馈激励。

Result: 在所有指标上表现优异，三年总回报率达到近300%。

Conclusion: QuantAgents框架通过多智能体协作和模拟交易，有效提升了投资策略评估和市场场景分析的能力，实现了显著的财务回报。

Abstract: In this paper, our objective is to develop a multi-agent financial system
that incorporates simulated trading, a technique extensively utilized by
financial professionals. While current LLM-based agent models demonstrate
competitive performance, they still exhibit significant deviations from
real-world fund companies. A critical distinction lies in the agents' reliance
on ``post-reflection'', particularly in response to adverse outcomes, but lack
a distinctly human capability: long-term prediction of future trends.
Therefore, we introduce QuantAgents, a multi-agent system integrating simulated
trading, to comprehensively evaluate various investment strategies and market
scenarios without assuming actual risks. Specifically, QuantAgents comprises
four agents: a simulated trading analyst, a risk control analyst, a market news
analyst, and a manager, who collaborate through several meetings. Moreover, our
system incentivizes agents to receive feedback on two fronts: performance in
real-world markets and predictive accuracy in simulated trading. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework excels across all metrics, yielding
an overall return of nearly 300% over the three years
(https://quantagents.github.io/).

*Xuanhua Yin,Runkai Zhao,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AFIRE是一个多模态fMRI编码框架，通过标准化时间对齐的融合token和MIND混合专家解码器，实现了全脑预测的端到端训练，提升了跨被试泛化能力和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然fMRI编码需要处理多模态输入、融合方式变化和显著的被试间差异，现有方法难以同时解决这些问题。

Method: AFIRE标准化来自不同编码器的融合token，MIND采用token依赖的Top-K稀疏路由和subject先验，实现个性化专家使用而不牺牲通用性。

Result: 在多个多模态骨干网络和被试上的实验显示，相比强基线有持续改进，增强了跨被试泛化能力，并发现了与内容类型相关的可解释专家模式。

Conclusion: 该框架为新编码器和数据集提供了简单的接入点，为自然神经影像研究实现了稳健的即插即用性能提升。

Abstract: Naturalistic fMRI encoding must handle multimodal inputs, shifting fusion
styles, and pronounced inter-subject variability. We introduce AFIRE (Agnostic
Framework for Multimodal fMRI Response Encoding), an agnostic interface that
standardizes time-aligned post-fusion tokens from varied encoders, and MIND, a
plug-and-play Mixture-of-Experts decoder with a subject-aware dynamic gating.
Trained end-to-end for whole-brain prediction, AFIRE decouples the decoder from
upstream fusion, while MIND combines token-dependent Top-K sparse routing with
a subject prior to personalize expert usage without sacrificing generality.
Experiments across multiple multimodal backbones and subjects show consistent
improvements over strong baselines, enhanced cross-subject generalization, and
interpretable expert patterns that correlate with content type. The framework
offers a simple attachment point for new encoders and datasets, enabling
robust, plug-and-improve performance for naturalistic neuroimaging studies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Watch & Learn框架，将互联网上的人类演示视频大规模转换为可执行的UI轨迹，解决了计算机使用代理训练数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理需要基于多样化、不断变化的应用和环境来规划任务工作流，但目标应用中大规模高质量训练数据的稀缺阻碍了学习。现有数据集领域特定、静态且标注成本高，而当前合成数据生成方法往往产生过于简化或不对齐的任务演示。

Method: 将问题转化为逆动力学目标：从连续屏幕状态预测用户动作。开发了包含任务感知视频检索的逆动力学标注流程，从原始网络视频生成了超过53k个高质量轨迹。

Result: 在OSWorld基准测试中，使用W&L提取的UI轨迹持续提升了通用和最先进框架的上下文表现，并在监督训练下为开源模型带来更强的性能提升。

Conclusion: 网络规模的人类演示视频是推进计算机使用代理向实际部署的实用且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUAs) need to plan task workflows grounded in diverse,
ever-changing applications and environments, but learning is hindered by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data in the target application.
Existing datasets are domain-specific, static, and costly to annotate, while
current synthetic data generation methods often yield simplistic or misaligned
task demonstrations. To address these limitations, we introduce Watch & Learn
(W&L), a framework that converts human demonstration videos readily available
on the Internet into executable UI trajectories at scale. Instead of directly
generating trajectories or relying on ad hoc reasoning heuristics, we cast the
problem as an inverse dynamics objective: predicting the user's action from
consecutive screen states. This formulation reduces manual engineering, is
easier to learn, and generalizes more robustly across applications. Concretely,
we develop an inverse dynamics labeling pipeline with task-aware video
retrieval, generate over 53k high-quality trajectories from raw web videos, and
demonstrate that these trajectories improve CUAs both as in-context
demonstrations and as supervised training data. On the challenging OSWorld
benchmark, UI trajectories extracted with W&L consistently enhance both
general-purpose and state-of-the-art frameworks in-context, and deliver
stronger gains for open-source models under supervised training. These results
highlight web-scale human demonstration videos as a practical and scalable
foundation for advancing CUAs towards real-world deployment.

*Yiding Wang,Zhepei Wei,Xinyu Zhu,Yu Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeSA提出了一种两阶段训练框架，将搜索优化与答案生成解耦，解决了仅基于结果奖励训练搜索增强代理时的系统性搜索缺陷问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习训练搜索增强代理的方法依赖结果奖励，但研究发现这会导致搜索行为出现系统性缺陷，包括工具调用失败、无效查询和冗余搜索，最终影响答案质量。

Method: DeSA采用两阶段训练：第一阶段使用检索召回率奖励优化搜索效果，第二阶段使用结果奖励优化最终答案生成。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，DeSA训练的代理显著提高了搜索召回率和答案准确率，优于仅基于结果奖励的基线方法。

Conclusion: 明确解耦搜索和回答两个目标对于训练有效的搜索增强代理至关重要，DeSA框架证明了这种解耦方法的有效性。

Abstract: Enabling large language models (LLMs) to utilize search tools offers a
promising path to overcoming fundamental limitations such as knowledge cutoffs
and hallucinations. Recent work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for
training search-augmented agents that interleave reasoning and retrieval before
answering. These approaches usually rely on outcome-based rewards (e.g., exact
match), implicitly assuming that optimizing for final answers will also yield
effective intermediate search behaviors. Our analysis challenges this
assumption: we uncover multiple systematic deficiencies in search that arise
under outcome-only training and ultimately degrade final answer quality,
including failure to invoke tools, invalid queries, and redundant searches. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce DeSA (Decoupling
Search-and-Answering), a simple two-stage training framework that explicitly
separates search optimization from answer generation. In Stage 1, agents are
trained to improve search effectiveness with retrieval recall-based rewards. In
Stage 2, outcome rewards are employed to optimize final answer generation.
Across seven QA benchmarks, DeSA-trained agents consistently improve search
behaviors, delivering substantially higher search recall and answer accuracy
than outcome-only baselines. Notably, DeSA outperforms single-stage training
approaches that simultaneously optimize recall and outcome rewards,
underscoring the necessity of explicitly decoupling the two objectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrokenMath是首个评估LLM在自然语言定理证明中谄媚行为的基准，发现GPT-5等先进模型在29%的情况下会产生谄媚回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准主要关注最终答案问题，缺乏对定理证明中谄媚行为的系统性评估，限制了LLM在定理证明中的应用。

Method: 基于2025年竞赛问题构建基准，使用LLM扰动生成错误陈述并通过专家评审完善，采用LLM-as-a-judge框架评估模型表现。

Result: 发现谄媚行为普遍存在，最佳模型GPT-5在29%的情况下产生谄媚回答。测试时干预和监督微调能显著减少但无法完全消除该行为。

Conclusion: LLM在数学定理证明中存在显著的谄媚问题，需要开发更有效的缓解策略来提升可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on
mathematical benchmarks. At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and
sycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect
mathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the
applicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed
proofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians. However, existing
benchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus
solely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated
datasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that
create ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are
demonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first
benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of
natural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025
competition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false
statements and subsequently refined through expert review. Using an
LLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems
and find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing
sycophantic answers 29% of the time. We further investigate several mitigation
strategies, including test-time interventions and supervised fine-tuning on
curated sycophantic examples. These approaches substantially reduce, but do not
eliminate, sycophantic behavior.

TL;DR: 提出LMM-Incentive机制，基于大语言模型和合约理论激励用户在Web 3.0中生成高质量UGC，解决信息不对称问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web 3.0中用户可能利用内容策展机制缺陷生成低质量内容获取奖励，这会损害平台性能，需要激励高质量内容生成。

Method: 使用LMM基于合约理论模型激励用户，利用LMM代理评估内容质量，开发改进的MoE-based PPO算法进行最优合约设计。

Result: 模拟结果显示MoE-based PPO算法在合约设计方面优于基准方法，并在以太坊智能合约框架中验证了方案有效性。

Conclusion: LMM-Incentive机制能有效激励高质量UGC生成，缓解信息不对称问题，提升Web 3.0平台性能。

Abstract: Web 3.0 represents the next generation of the Internet, which is widely
recognized as a decentralized ecosystem that focuses on value expression and
data ownership. By leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence
technologies, Web 3.0 offers unprecedented opportunities for users to create,
own, and monetize their content, thereby enabling User-Generated Content (UGC)
to an entirely new level. However, some self-interested users may exploit the
limitations of content curation mechanisms and generate low-quality content
with less effort, obtaining platform rewards under information asymmetry. Such
behavior can undermine Web 3.0 performance. To this end, we propose
\textit{LMM-Incentive}, a novel Large Multimodal Model (LMM)-based incentive
mechanism for UGC in Web 3.0. Specifically, we propose an LMM-based
contract-theoretic model to motivate users to generate high-quality UGC,
thereby mitigating the adverse selection problem from information asymmetry. To
alleviate potential moral hazards after contract selection, we leverage LMM
agents to evaluate UGC quality, which is the primary component of the contract,
utilizing prompt engineering techniques to improve the evaluation performance
of LMM agents. Recognizing that traditional contract design methods cannot
effectively adapt to the dynamic environment of Web 3.0, we develop an improved
Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for
optimal contract design. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed MoE-based PPO algorithm over representative benchmarks in the context
of contract design. Finally, we deploy the designed contract within an Ethereum
smart contract framework, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed
scheme.

### [250] [Hybrid-Balance GFlowNet for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04792)
*Ni Zhang,Zhiguang Cao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了混合平衡GFlowNet（HBG）框架，将轨迹平衡和细节平衡有机结合，解决了车辆路径问题中全局优化与局部优化的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GFlowNet方法主要使用轨迹平衡进行全局优化，但忽视了局部优化的重要性。而细节平衡虽然擅长局部优化，但单独使用无法有效解决需要整体轨迹优化的车辆路径问题。

Method: 开发了混合平衡GFlowNet框架，以原则性和自适应方式整合轨迹平衡和细节平衡，利用它们内在的互补优势。还提出了针对仓库中心场景的专门推理策略。

Result: 将HBG集成到AGFN和GFACS两个现有GFlowNet求解器中，在CVRP和TSP问题上都实现了持续且显著的改进。

Conclusion: HBG框架通过平衡全局和局部优化，显著提升了解决方案质量和泛化能力，适用于有仓库和无仓库的多种路径规划问题。

Abstract: Existing GFlowNet-based methods for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) typically
employ Trajectory Balance (TB) to achieve global optimization but often neglect
important aspects of local optimization. While Detailed Balance (DB) addresses
local optimization more effectively, it alone falls short in solving VRPs,
which inherently require holistic trajectory optimization. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Hybrid-Balance GFlowNet (HBG) framework, which
uniquely integrates TB and DB in a principled and adaptive manner by aligning
their intrinsically complementary strengths. Additionally, we propose a
specialized inference strategy for depot-centric scenarios like the Capacitated
Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), leveraging the depot node's greater flexibility
in selecting successors. Despite this specialization, HBG maintains broad
applicability, extending effectively to problems without explicit depots, such
as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We evaluate HBG by integrating it into
two established GFlowNet-based solvers, i.e., AGFN and GFACS, and demonstrate
consistent and significant improvements across both CVRP and TSP, underscoring
the enhanced solution quality and generalization afforded by our approach.

*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NLEL是一种自然语言边缘标记系统，通过将自由形式的自然语言指令附加到搜索边缘，并将其转换为模式限定的控制向量，从而解耦推理意图与执行过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的结构化LM推理控制器（如Chain-of-Thought、Tree-of-Thoughts）将'下一步尝试什么'与'如何执行'混在一起，导致系统脆弱、计算效率低且难以审计。

Method: 引入标签器Λ从父状态和紧凑上下文发出标签，调谐器Ψ将(P,L,C)映射到Π，具有严格的模式验证和安全默认值的信任区域投影。下游选择采用ToT风格，使用分数S=μ+βσ和深度退火β。

Result: 证明NLEL严格泛化了CoT/ToT，证明了在标签条件捆绑下top-k选择的任意时间单调性，并通过控制向量失真限制了选择器不足。

Conclusion: NLEL提供了一个可解释、模型无关的接口，将意图与执行分离，实现可控、可审计的LM推理。

Abstract: Controllers for structured LM reasoning (e.g., Chain-of-Thought,
self-consistency, and Tree-of-Thoughts) often entangle what to try next with
how to execute it, exposing only coarse global knobs and yielding brittle,
compute-inefficient, and hard-to-audit behavior. We introduce Natural Language
Edge Labelling (NLEL), a labeller-tuner overlay that attaches a free-form
natural-language directive to each search edge and translates it into a
schema-bounded control vector for decoding, search (branch quotas, exploration
$\beta$), generation bundle size, retrieval mixtures, and verification passes.
A labeller $\Lambda$ emits labels from the parent state and a compact context;
a tuner $\Psi$ maps $(P, L, C)\to \Pi$, with strict schema validation and
trust-region projection around safe defaults. Downstream selection remains
ToT-style with score $S=\mu+\beta\sigma$ and depth-annealed $\beta$. We show
NLEL strictly generalizes CoT/ToT, prove an anytime-monotonicity property for
top-$k$ selection under label-conditioned bundles, and bound selector shortfall
by control-vector distortion, providing decision-relevant justification for
guards like trust regions and verification passes. We instantiate $\Psi$ as a
prompt-only JSON Parameter Emitter and preregister an evaluation on GSM8K, MATH
(subset), StrategyQA, and ARC-Challenge with compute-aware reporting
(success@compute, tokens-per-success) and ablations over $\Lambda$, $\Psi$,
trust-region radius, and control quantization; preregistered forecasts
anticipate accuracy gains at comparable token budgets and improved
success@compute under constraints. NLEL offers an interpretable, model-agnostic
interface that separates intent from execution for controllable, auditable LM
inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多智能体系统中记忆的设计空间，研究记忆应该放在哪里、如何检索以及哪些智能体受益最大。

Method: 将过去任务轨迹分解为可重用记忆单元，并在编排器和任务智能体间灵活分配这些记忆。使用OfficeBench基准进行实验。

Result: 编排器记忆对任务分解和委派至关重要，细粒度智能体记忆提高执行准确性。即使由较小语言模型组成的团队也能从程序性记忆中获益，缩小与更强智能体的性能差距。

Conclusion: LEGOMem既是记忆增强智能体系统的实用框架，也是理解多智能体工作流自动化中记忆设计的研究工具。

Abstract: We introduce LEGOMem, a modular procedural memory framework for multi-agent
large language model (LLM) systems in workflow automation. LEGOMem decomposes
past task trajectories into reusable memory units and flexibly allocates them
across orchestrators and task agents to support planning and execution. To
explore the design space of memory in multi-agent systems, we use LEGOMem as a
lens and conduct a systematic study of procedural memory in multi-agent
systems, examining where memory should be placed, how it should be retrieved,
and which agents benefit most. Experiments on the OfficeBench benchmark show
that orchestrator memory is critical for effective task decomposition and
delegation, while fine-grained agent memory improves execution accuracy. We
find that even teams composed of smaller language models can benefit
substantially from procedural memory, narrowing the performance gap with
stronger agents by leveraging prior execution traces for more accurate planning
and tool use. These results position LEGOMem as both a practical framework for
memory-augmented agent systems and a research tool for understanding memory
design in multi-agent workflow automation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将程序化内容生成重构为多智能体强化学习问题，通过分布式方法解决单智能体PCGRL在奖励计算效率和地图导航方面的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PCGRL研究主要关注单智能体生成器，但面临频繁重新计算启发式质量指标和在大型地图中导航的效率瓶颈问题。

Method: 将关卡生成构建为多智能体问题，通过分布式智能体协作减少奖励计算次数，并学习更局部化、模块化的设计策略。

Result: 多智能体关卡生成器在效率上优于单智能体方法，且能更好地泛化到分布外地图形状，表明其学习了更有效的局部设计策略。

Conclusion: 将内容生成视为分布式多智能体任务有利于大规模生成功能性内容，是多智能体PCGRL的首次系统性探索。

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL) offers a
method for training controllable level designer agents without the need for
human datasets, using metrics that serve as proxies for level quality as
rewards. Existing PCGRL research focuses on single generator agents, but are
bottlenecked by the need to frequently recalculate heuristics of level quality
and the agent's need to navigate around potentially large maps. By framing
level generation as a multi-agent problem, we mitigate the efficiency
bottleneck of single-agent PCGRL by reducing the number of reward calculations
relative to the number of agent actions. We also find that multi-agent level
generators are better able to generalize to out-of-distribution map shapes,
which we argue is due to the generators' learning more local, modular design
policies. We conclude that treating content generation as a distributed,
multi-agent task is beneficial for generating functional artifacts at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在分析复杂交互轨迹时，难以准确一致地定位智能体和步骤级别的失败，需要更有效的错误归因方法。

Method: 结合分层上下文表示、基于目标分析的评估和共识投票机制，利用基于位置的上下文理解层级化，同时保持客观评估标准。

Conclusion: 结构化的分层上下文表示与基于共识的客观决策相结合，为多智能体系统错误归因提供了更鲁棒的框架。

Abstract: Error attribution in Large Language Model (LLM) multi-agent systems presents
a significant challenge in debugging and improving collaborative AI systems.
Current approaches to pinpointing agent and step level failures in interaction
traces - whether using all-at-once evaluation, step-by-step analysis, or binary
search - fall short when analyzing complex patterns, struggling with both
accuracy and consistency. We present ECHO (Error attribution through Contextual
Hierarchy and Objective consensus analysis), a novel algorithm that combines
hierarchical context representation, objective analysis-based evaluation, and
consensus voting to improve error attribution accuracy. Our approach leverages
a positional-based leveling of contextual understanding while maintaining
objective evaluation criteria, ultimately reaching conclusions through a
consensus mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO outperforms
existing methods across various multi-agent interaction scenarios, showing
particular strength in cases involving subtle reasoning errors and complex
interdependencies. Our findings suggest that leveraging these concepts of
structured, hierarchical context representation combined with consensus-based
objective decision-making, provides a more robust framework for error
attribution in multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作使用专门数据集和单任务系统处理心理社会行为，但缺乏可扩展性、跨任务迁移和泛化能力。需要统一基准来支持理解复杂、多面、个性化行为特征的模型开发。

Method: 构建Human Behavior Atlas统一基准，包含文本、音频、视觉多模态数据，涵盖情感状态、认知状态、病理和社会过程等任务。训练了三个OmniSapiens-7B模型：SFT、BAM和RL版本。

Result: 在Human Behavior Atlas上训练的模型在多样化行为任务上持续优于现有多模态大模型。预训练还提高了向新行为数据集的迁移能力，使用行为描述符带来了有意义的性能提升。

Conclusion: Human Behavior Atlas基准通过减少冗余和成本，支持跨任务高效训练，增强行为特征的跨领域泛化，为开发理解心理社会行为的统一模型提供了有效平台。

Abstract: Using intelligent systems to perceive psychological and social behaviors,
that is, the underlying affective, cognitive, and pathological states that are
manifested through observable behaviors and social interactions, remains a
challenge due to their complex, multifaceted, and personalized nature. Existing
work tackling these dimensions through specialized datasets and single-task
systems often miss opportunities for scalability, cross-task transfer, and
broader generalization. To address this gap, we curate Human Behavior Atlas, a
unified benchmark of diverse behavioral tasks designed to support the
development of unified models for understanding psychological and social
behaviors. Human Behavior Atlas comprises over 100,000 samples spanning text,
audio, and visual modalities, covering tasks on affective states, cognitive
states, pathologies, and social processes. Our unification efforts can reduce
redundancy and cost, enable training to scale efficiently across tasks, and
enhance generalization of behavioral features across domains. On Human Behavior
Atlas, we train three models: OmniSapiens-7B SFT, OmniSapiens-7B BAM, and
OmniSapiens-7B RL. We show that training on Human Behavior Atlas enables models
to consistently outperform existing multimodal LLMs across diverse behavioral
tasks. Pretraining on Human Behavior Atlas also improves transfer to novel
behavioral datasets; with the targeted use of behavioral descriptors yielding
meaningful performance gains.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit a tendency for overanalysis in
simple tasks, where the models excessively utilize System 2-type, deliberate
reasoning, leading to inefficient token generation. Furthermore, these models
face challenges in adapting their reasoning capabilities to rapidly changing
environments due to the static nature of their pretraining data. To address
these issues, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning
tasks requires innovative approaches that bridge intuitive and deliberate
cognitive processes, akin to human cognition's dual-system dynamic. This paper
introduces a Multi-Agent System for Deep ReSearch (MARS) enabling seamless
integration of System 1's fast, intuitive thinking with System 2's deliberate
reasoning within LLMs. MARS strategically integrates multiple external tools,
such as Google Search, Google Scholar, and Python Interpreter, to access
up-to-date information and execute complex computations, while creating a
specialized division of labor where System 1 efficiently processes and
summarizes high-volume external information, providing distilled insights that
expand System 2's reasoning context without overwhelming its capacity.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
extending Group Relative Policy Optimization to simultaneously optimize both
systems with multi-turn tool interactions, bin-packing optimization, and sample
balancing strategies that enhance collaborative efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate MARS achieves substantial improvements of 3.86% on the
challenging Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark and an average gain of 8.9%
across 7 knowledge-intensive tasks, validating the effectiveness of our
dual-system paradigm for complex reasoning in dynamic information environments.

Motivation: 传统算法交易系统难以在追求执行质量的同时确保严格的合规性，需要平衡执行效率与监管要求。

Method: 将交易执行为约束马尔可夫决策过程，使用近端策略优化训练执行代理，运行时动作防护确保行动可行性，并添加零知识合规审计层。

Conclusion: 该系统在最优执行、安全强化学习、监管技术和可验证AI的交叉领域取得进展，为实际部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We present a cross-market algorithmic trading system that balances execution
quality with rigorous compliance enforcement. The architecture comprises a
high-level planner, a reinforcement learning execution agent, and an
independent compliance agent. We formulate trade execution as a constrained
Markov decision process with hard constraints on participation limits, price
bands, and self-trading avoidance. The execution agent is trained with proximal
policy optimization, while a runtime action-shield projects any unsafe action
into a feasible set. To support auditability without exposing proprietary
signals, we add a zero-knowledge compliance audit layer that produces
cryptographic proofs that all actions satisfied the constraints. We evaluate in
a multi-venue, ABIDES-based simulator and compare against standard baselines
(e.g., TWAP, VWAP). The learned policy reduces implementation shortfall and
variance while exhibiting no observed constraint violations across stress
scenarios including elevated latency, partial fills, compliance module
toggling, and varying constraint limits. We report effects at the 95%
confidence level using paired t-tests and examine tail risk via CVaR. We
situate the work at the intersection of optimal execution, safe reinforcement
learning, regulatory technology, and verifiable AI, and discuss ethical
considerations, limitations (e.g., modeling assumptions and computational
overhead), and paths to real-world deployment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of embodied intelligence and world models has
intensified efforts to integrate physical laws into AI systems, yet physical

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在动态协作环境中推断他人行为背后动机的心智理论能力，这在多智能体协作中至关重要。

Method: 开发LLM-Hanabi基准测试框架，使用合作游戏《花火》并建立自动化评估系统，同时测量游戏表现和心智理论熟练度。

Result: 发现心智理论与游戏成功呈显著正相关，一阶心智理论比二阶心智理论与表现的相关性更强。

Conclusion: 对于有效的AI协作，准确理解合作伙伴推理的能力比高阶推理更关键，优先发展一阶心智理论是提升未来模型协作能力的有希望方向。

Abstract: Effective multi-agent collaboration requires agents to infer the rationale
behind others' actions, a capability rooted in Theory-of-Mind (ToM). While
recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at logical inference, their ability
to infer rationale in dynamic, collaborative settings remains under-explored.
This study introduces LLM-Hanabi, a novel benchmark that uses the cooperative
game Hanabi to evaluate the rationale inference and ToM of LLMs. Our framework
features an automated evaluation system that measures both game performance and
ToM proficiency. Across a range of models, we find a significant positive
correlation between ToM and in-game success. Notably, first-order ToM
(interpreting others' intent) correlates more strongly with performance than
second-order ToM (predicting others' interpretations). These findings highlight
that for effective AI collaboration, the ability to accurately interpret a
partner's rationale is more critical than higher-order reasoning. We conclude
that prioritizing first-order ToM is a promising direction for enhancing the
collaborative capabilities of future models.

Motivation: 现有方法将多模态大语言模型仅作为编码器使用，忽视了其生成能力，在处理复杂指令和组合推理时效果不佳

Method: TTE框架包含推理器和嵌入器：推理器MLLM先生成解释复杂查询的推理轨迹，嵌入器基于原始查询和中间推理生成表示

Result: 在MMEB-V2基准上超越专有模型；通过微调小型MLLM推理器，在开源模型中取得最佳性能，比最近模型提升7%；实现了推理器和嵌入器的统一集成

Conclusion: 显式推理步骤能够更好地理解复杂多模态指令，TTE框架在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升

Abstract: There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where
models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent
studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such
tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative
capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as
instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired
by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general
Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an
embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain
complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations
conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This
explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex
multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging
a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house
datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune
a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces,
achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain
over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating
the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without
sacrificing performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不完美信息游戏中模型学习困难的问题，传统方法需要显式环境模型但在现实场景中往往不可得或过于复杂，MuZero等完美信息游戏方法难以直接扩展到不完美信息游戏。

Method: 提出LAMIR算法，直接从智能体-环境交互中学习不完美信息游戏的抽象模型，在测试时使用训练好的模型进行前瞻推理，通过学习抽象化将每个子游戏限制在可管理的大小。

Result: 实验证明，当容量充足时LAMIR能学习到精确的底层游戏结构；在有限容量下仍能学习到有价值的抽象，提升预训练智能体在大型游戏中的表现。

Conclusion: LAMIR通过模型抽象使理论上合理的前瞻推理在大型不完美信息游戏中变得可行，显著提升了预训练AI代理的性能。

Abstract: Test-time reasoning significantly enhances pre-trained AI agents'
performance. However, it requires an explicit environment model, often
unavailable or overly complex in real-world scenarios. While MuZero enables
effective model learning for search in perfect information games, extending
this paradigm to imperfect information games presents substantial challenges
due to more nuanced look-ahead reasoning techniques and large number of states
relevant for individual decisions. This paper introduces an algorithm LAMIR
that learns an abstracted model of an imperfect information game directly from
the agent-environment interaction. During test time, this trained model is used
to perform look-ahead reasoning. The learned abstraction limits the size of
each subgame to a manageable size, making theoretically principled look-ahead
reasoning tractable even in games where previous methods could not scale. We
empirically demonstrate that with sufficient capacity, LAMIR learns the exact
underlying game structure, and with limited capacity, it still learns a
valuable abstraction, which improves game playing performance of the
pre-trained agents even in large games.

TL;DR: 提出阶梯式流处理技术，通过部分中间输出立即生成最终响应，显著降低多智能体推理的首令牌延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体推理虽然能提升响应质量，但会显著增加首令牌延迟，影响用户体验，特别是在延迟敏感的应用中。

Method: 采用阶梯式流处理，无需等待完整中间输出，一旦收到部分中间输出就开始生成最终响应。

Result: 实验结果显示阶梯式流处理将首令牌延迟降低高达93%，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 阶梯式流处理是解决多智能体推理延迟问题的有效方法，能在保持质量的同时大幅降低延迟。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) opened up new directions for
leveraging the collective expertise of multiple LLMs. These methods, such as
Mixture-of-Agents, typically employ additional inference steps to generate
intermediate outputs, which are then used to produce the final response. While
multi-agent inference can enhance response quality, it can significantly
increase the time to first token (TTFT), posing a challenge for
latency-sensitive applications and hurting user experience. To address this
issue, we propose staircase streaming for low-latency multi-agent inference.
Instead of waiting for the complete intermediate outputs from previous steps,
we begin generating the final response as soon as we receive partial outputs
from these steps. Experimental results demonstrate that staircase streaming
reduces TTFT by up to 93% while maintaining response quality.

TL;DR: PARS是一个基于提示感知的LLM任务调度器，通过近似最短作业优先调度来减少头部阻塞，提升LLM推理服务的效率和延迟表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FCFS调度策略存在头部阻塞问题，长任务会延迟短任务的执行，影响LLM推理服务的延迟和吞吐量。

Method: 使用成对排序和边缘排序损失来近似SJF调度，预测基于响应长度的任务排序，并集成到vLLM系统中。

Result: 在多个LLM和真实推理数据集上的实验表明，PARS显著提升了性能，包括推理工作负载，且设计具有良好的跨模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: PARS通过提示感知调度有效解决了LLM推理中的头部阻塞问题，实现了低延迟高吞吐的服务效率。

Abstract: Efficient scheduling of LLM inference tasks is essential for achieving low
latency and high throughput, particularly with the growing use of
reasoning-capable LLMs. Traditional strategies like First-Come-First-Serve
(FCFS) often suffer from Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking, where long-running tasks
delay shorter ones queued behind them. In this paper, we introduce PARS, a
prompt-aware LLM task scheduler that improves serving efficiency by
approximating shortest-job-first (SJF) scheduling through pairwise ranking with
margin ranking loss. PARS focuses on impactful scheduling decisions and is
seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM. It
effectively predicts response-length-based task ordering, reducing latency with
minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world
inference datasets show that PARS significantly improves performance, including
for reasoning workloads. Furthermore, our cross-model evaluations demonstrate
that the design generalizes well, enabling effective scheduling even when
predictors are trained on different LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大时间序列基础模型采用通道独立架构，忽略了关键的跨通道依赖关系；同时现有多模态方法未能充分利用大型视觉模型解释时空数据的能力；不同模态信息提取的优势在提升时间序列预测性能方面仍有巨大潜力未被开发。

Method: 将多元时间序列渲染成图像，利用预训练的大型视觉模型提取复杂的跨通道模式，这些视觉特征与时间序列模态的表征进行对齐和融合，冻结大型视觉模型仅训练7.45%的参数。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: VIFO提供了一种高效有效的解决方案，用于捕捉时间序列中的跨变量关系。

Abstract: Large time series foundation models often adopt channel-independent
architectures to handle varying data dimensions, but this design ignores
crucial cross-channel dependencies. Concurrently, existing multimodal
approaches have not fully exploited the power of large vision models (LVMs) to
interpret spatiotemporal data. Additionally, there remains significant
unexplored potential in leveraging the advantages of information extraction
from different modalities to enhance time series forecasting performance. To
address these gaps, we propose the VIFO, a cross-modal forecasting model. VIFO
uniquely renders multivariate time series into image, enabling pre-trained LVM
to extract complex cross-channel patterns that are invisible to
channel-independent models. These visual features are then aligned and fused
with representations from the time series modality. By freezing the LVM and
training only 7.45% of its parameters, VIFO achieves competitive performance on
multiple benchmarks, offering an efficient and effective solution for capturing
cross-variable relationships in

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the presence of
real world noise and intentional perturbations remains a significant challenge.
To address this, attribution methods have been proposed, though their efficacy
remains suboptimal and necessitates further refinement. In this paper, we
propose a novel category of transferable adversarial attacks, called
transferable frequency-aware attacks, enabling frequency-aware exploration via
both high-and low-frequency components. Based on this type of attacks, we also
propose a novel attribution method, named Frequency-Aware Model Parameter
Explorer (FAMPE), which improves the explainability for DNNs. Relative to the
current state-of-the-art method AttEXplore, our FAMPE attains an average gain
of 13.02% in Insertion Score, thereby outperforming existing approaches.
Through detailed ablation studies, we also investigate the role of both high-
and low-frequency components in explainability.

Conclusion: STRUPRUNE成功解决了结构化剪枝与内存效率的权衡问题，为大规模语言模型的实际部署提供了可行的剪枝方案。

Abstract: Pruning is critical for scaling large language models (LLMs). Global pruning
achieves strong performance but requires $\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory, which is
infeasible for billion-parameter models. Local pruning reduces GPU memory usage
to that of a single layer by pruning layers independently, but it neglects
inter-layer dependencies and often leads to suboptimal performance in
high-sparsity regimes. Unlike unstructured pruning, structured pruning produces
regular sparsity patterns that align well with GPU kernels and library
optimizations, making it more hardware-efficient. However, structured pruning
typically relies on global pruning, since structured patterns are more prone to
severe performance degradation under local optimization. To jointly achieve
structured pruning and the memory efficiency of local pruning, we propose a
divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the global pruning problem into
coordinated subproblems across different modules, each of which fits within
limited GPU memory. Building on this idea, we design \textbf{STRUPRUNE}, an
ADMM-based framework that integrates structured sparsity into the pruning
process, combining the memory efficiency of local pruning with the hardware
compatibility of structured methods. We derive a closed-form analytical
solution for structured pruning masks that provides an explicit rule for
layer-wise sparsity allocation, and further develop an energy-based asymptotic
framework yielding a softmax-form allocation scheme that simplifies
optimization while adapting to heterogeneous layer importance. Experiments
demonstrate that STRUPRUNE matches the perplexity of global structured pruning
while reducing memory cost from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
enabling practical deployment at the billion-parameter scale.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多模态学习中跨模态对齐的标注瓶颈问题，为降低多模态标注成本提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) is a principled strategy to reduce annotation cost in
data-hungry deep learning. However, existing AL algorithms focus almost
exclusively on unimodal data, overlooking the substantial annotation burden in
multimodal learning. We introduce the first framework for multimodal active
learning with unaligned data, where the learner must actively acquire
cross-modal alignments rather than labels on pre-aligned pairs. This setting
captures the practical bottleneck in modern multimodal pipelines such as CLIP
and SigLIP, where unimodal features are easy to obtain but high-quality
alignment is costly. We develop a new algorithm that combines uncertainty and
diversity principles in a modality-aware design, achieves linear-time
acquisition, and applies seamlessly to both pool-based and streaming-based
settings. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently reduces multimodal annotation cost while preserving
performance; for instance, on the ColorSwap dataset it cuts annotation
requirements by up to $40\%$ without loss in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创伤性脑损伤是全球重大公共卫生问题，传统有限元模型计算成本高，限制了临床快速决策应用。需要开发快速、患者特定的脑位移预测方法。

Method: 将TBI建模为算子学习问题，使用四种神经算子架构（FNO、F-FNO、MG-FNO、DeepONet）从患者特定的解剖MRI、MRE刚度图和人口统计学特征映射到全视野3D脑位移预测。在249个MRE数据集上进行训练评估。

Conclusion: 神经算子为预测脑变形提供了高效、分辨率不变的方法，为实现实时、患者特定的TBI风险评估、临床分诊支持和防护设备优化打开了大门，展示了基于NO的人脑数字孪生的潜力。

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major public health concern, with over
69 million cases annually worldwide. Finite element (FE) models offer
high-fidelity predictions of brain deformation but are computationally
expensive, requiring hours per simulation and limiting their clinical utility
for rapid decision-making. This study benchmarks state-of-the-art neural
operator (NO) architectures for rapid, patient-specific prediction of brain
displacement fields, aiming to enable real-time TBI modeling in clinical and
translational settings. We formulated TBI modeling as an operator learning
problem, mapping subject-specific anatomical MRI, magnetic resonance
elastography (MRE) stiffness maps, and demographic features to full-field 3D
brain displacement predictions. Four architectures - Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO), Factorized FNO (F-FNO), Multi-Grid FNO (MG-FNO), and Deep Operator
Network (DeepONet) were trained and evaluated on 249 MRE datasets across
physiologically relevant frequencies (20 - 90 Hz). MG-FNO achieved the highest
accuracy (MSE = 0.0023, 94.3\% spatial fidelity) and preserved fine-scale
features, while F-FNO converged 2$\times$ faster than standard FNO. DeepONet
offered the fastest inference (14.5 iterations/s) with a 7$\times$
computational speed-up over MG-FNO, suggesting utility for embedded or edge
computing applications. All NOs reduced computation time from hours to
milliseconds without sacrificing anatomical realism. NOs provide an efficient,
resolution-invariant approach for predicting brain deformation, opening the
door to real-time, patient-specific TBI risk assessment, clinical triage
support, and optimization of protective equipment. These results highlight the
potential for NO-based digital twins of the human brain, enabling scalable,
on-demand biomechanical modeling in both clinical and population health
contexts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可微分逻辑门网络在推理时效率很高，但存在梯度消失、离散化误差和高训练成本等问题，即使使用专门的参数初始化方案，增加网络深度仍会损害准确性。

Method: 通过重新参数化逻辑门神经元，将每个门的参数数量按输入数量的对数比例缩小。对于二进制输入，模型大小减少4倍，反向传播速度提升1.86倍。

Result: 训练步骤减少8.5倍，在CIFAR-100上的准确性保持稳定，有时甚至优于原始参数化方法。

Conclusion: 重新参数化方法有效解决了DLGNs的可扩展性问题，同时保持了竞争性的准确性。

Abstract: Differentiable logic gate networks (DLGNs) exhibit extraordinary efficiency
at inference while sustaining competitive accuracy. But vanishing gradients,
discretization errors, and high training cost impede scaling these networks.
Even with dedicated parameter initialization schemes from subsequent works,
increasing depth still harms accuracy. We show that the root cause of these
issues lies in the underlying parametrization of logic gate neurons themselves.
To overcome this issue, we propose a reparametrization that also shrinks the
parameter size logarithmically in the number of inputs per gate. For binary
inputs, this already reduces the model size by 4x, speeds up the backward pass
by up to 1.86x, and converges in 8.5x fewer training steps. On top of that, we
show that the accuracy on CIFAR-100 remains stable and sometimes superior to
the original parametrization.

TL;DR: 提出Numerion模型，利用超复数空间自然分解时间序列，通过多维度RHR-MLP架构实现高效预测，在多个公开数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分解方法受限于计算复杂性和假设的鲁棒性，研究发现超复数空间中时间序列的特征频率会自然降低，这为模型设计提供了新思路。

Method: 基于理论支持，将线性层和激活函数推广到任意2的幂次维度的超复数空间，提出RHR-MLP架构，使用多个RHR-MLP将时间序列映射到不同维度的超复数空间进行自然分解和独立建模，并通过动态融合机制自适应融合不同空间的潜在模式。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上验证了模型性能，达到最先进水平。可视化和定量分析全面证明了多维RHR-MLP自然分解时间序列的能力，以及高维超复数空间捕捉低频特征的倾向。

Conclusion: Numerion模型通过超复数空间实现了时间序列的自然分解和高效预测，为时间序列分析提供了新的理论框架和实用工具。

Abstract: Many methods aim to enhance time series forecasting by decomposing the series
through intricate model structures and prior knowledge, yet they are inevitably
limited by computational complexity and the robustness of the assumptions. Our
research uncovers that in the complex domain and higher-order hypercomplex
spaces, the characteristic frequencies of time series naturally decrease.
Leveraging this insight, we propose Numerion, a time series forecasting model
based on multiple hypercomplex spaces. Specifically, grounded in theoretical
support, we generalize linear layers and activation functions to hypercomplex
spaces of arbitrary power-of-two dimensions and introduce a novel
Real-Hypercomplex-Real Domain Multi-Layer Perceptron (RHR-MLP) architecture.
Numerion utilizes multiple RHR-MLPs to map time series into hypercomplex spaces
of varying dimensions, naturally decomposing and independently modeling the
series, and adaptively fuses the latent patterns exhibited in different spaces
through a dynamic fusion mechanism. Experiments validate the model`s
performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple public datasets.
Visualizations and quantitative analyses comprehensively demonstrate the
ability of multi-dimensional RHR-MLPs to naturally decompose time series and
reveal the tendency of higher dimensional hypercomplex spaces to capture lower
frequency features.

TL;DR: 提出通用多域翻译(UMDT)框架，使用扩散路由(DR)方法，仅需K-1个中心域配对数据集即可实现K个域间的任意双向翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多域翻译方法需要完全对齐的元组或只能处理训练中见过的域对，限制了实用性并排除了许多跨域映射。

Method: 提出扩散路由(DR)框架，使用单一噪声预测器建模所有中心域与非中心域间的翻译，支持通过中心域进行间接翻译，并引入变分下界目标和Tweedie精炼程序支持直接映射。

Result: 在三个大规模UMDT基准测试中取得最先进结果，同时降低采样成本，解锁了如草图↔分割等新任务。

Conclusion: DR被证明是一个可扩展且通用的多域翻译框架，能够实现跨多个域的通用翻译。

Abstract: Multi-domain translation (MDT) aims to learn translations between multiple
domains, yet existing approaches either require fully aligned tuples or can
only handle domain pairs seen in training, limiting their practicality and
excluding many cross-domain mappings. We introduce universal MDT (UMDT), a
generalization of MDT that seeks to translate between any pair of $K$ domains
using only $K-1$ paired datasets with a central domain. To tackle this problem,
we propose Diffusion Router (DR), a unified diffusion-based framework that
models all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations with a single noise
predictor conditioned on the source and target domain labels. DR enables
indirect non-central translations by routing through the central domain. We
further introduce a novel scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound
objective and an efficient Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct
non-central mappings. Through evaluation on three large-scale UMDT benchmarks,
DR achieves state-of-the-art results for both indirect and direct translations,
while lowering sampling cost and unlocking novel tasks such as
sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. These results establish DR as a scalable
and versatile framework for universal translation across multiple domains.

TL;DR: 提出分层偏好学习(HPL)框架，通过多粒度偏好信号优化LLM智能体，解决轨迹级DPO信号过粗和步级DPO过于短视的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于偏好的离线方法如DPO存在粒度不匹配问题：轨迹级DPO信号太粗糙，步级DPO过于短视，无法准确评估多步行为价值。

Method: HPL框架包含轨迹级、步级和组级DPO，核心创新是双课程调度的组级偏好优化：将专家轨迹分解为语义连贯的动作组，生成对比次优组进行细粒度偏好学习，并按组长度和样本难度组织从简单到复杂的学习过程。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的智能体基准测试中，HPL优于现有最先进方法。分析表明分层DPO损失有效整合多粒度偏好信号，双课程调度对解决从简单行为到复杂多步序列的广泛任务至关重要。

Conclusion: HPL通过分层偏好学习和双课程调度，有效解决了LLM智能体在多粒度偏好优化中的挑战，为复杂长视野问题提供了更精确的信用分配机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents are increasingly tasked
with solving complex, long-horizon problems. Aligning these agents via
preference-based offline methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a
promising direction, yet it faces a critical granularity mismatch.
Trajectory-level DPO provides a signal that is too coarse for precise credit
assignment, while step-level DPO is often too myopic to capture the value of
multi-step behaviors. To resolve this challenge, we introduce Hierarchical
Preference Learning (HPL), a hierarchical framework that optimizes LLM agents
by leveraging preference signals at multiple, synergistic granularities. While
HPL incorporates trajectory- and step-level DPO for global and local policy
stability, its core innovation lies in group-level preference optimization
guided by a dual-layer curriculum. Our approach first decomposes expert
trajectories into semantically coherent action groups and then generates
contrasting suboptimal groups to enable preference learning at a fine-grained,
sub-task level. Then, instead of treating all preference pairs equally, HPL
introduces a curriculum scheduler that organizes the learning process from
simple to complex. This curriculum is structured along two axes: the group
length, representing sub-task complexity, and the sample difficulty, defined by
the reward gap between preferred and dispreferred action groups. Experiments on
three challenging agent benchmarks show that HPL outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. Our analyses demonstrate that the hierarchical DPO
loss effectively integrates preference signals across multiple granularities,
while the dual-layer curriculum is crucial for enabling the agent to solve a
wide range of tasks, from simple behaviors to complex multi-step sequences.

Motivation: 现有的悲观双层优化方法中对手不受限制，可能导致模型过度悲观和不切实际，当对手数据变得无意义时会降低分类器在真实数据上的性能。

Method: 构建约束悲观双层优化模型，限制对手的移动范围，找到更能反映现实情况的解决方案。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在平均性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过约束对手行为，约束悲观双层优化能够产生更现实和有效的对抗性机器学习解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial machine learning concerns situations in which learners face
attacks from active adversaries. Such scenarios arise in applications such as
spam email filtering, malware detection and fake image generation, where
security methods must be actively updated to keep up with the everimproving
generation of malicious data. Pessimistic Bilevel optimisation has been shown
to be an effective method of training resilient classifiers against such
adversaries. By modelling these scenarios as a game between the learner and the
adversary, we anticipate how the adversary will modify their data and then
train a resilient classifier accordingly. However, since existing pessimistic
bilevel approaches feature an unrestricted adversary, the model is vulnerable
to becoming overly pessimistic and unrealistic. When finding the optimal
solution that defeats the classifier, it is possible that the adversary's data
becomes nonsensical and loses its intended nature. Such an adversary will not
properly reflect reality, and consequently, will lead to poor classifier
performance when implemented on real-world data. By constructing a constrained
pessimistic bilevel optimisation model, we restrict the adversary's movements
and identify a solution that better reflects reality. We demonstrate through
experiments that this model performs, on average, better than the existing
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态LLM要么将数值序列编码为文本，要么转换为图像，这种方法对于科学时间序列的全面理解和生成可能不够充分。现有统一时间序列模型通常专门用于预测或分析，其在非周期性、异质性科学信号上的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 引入SciTS基准，涵盖12个科学领域、43个任务，包含超过5万个实例，包括单变量和多变量信号，长度从10^0到10^7，频率高达10MHz。对17个模型进行基准测试，包括纯文本LLM、多模态LLM和统一时间序列模型。

Result: 通用LLM表现出比专用时间序列模型更强的泛化能力。将时间序列表示为文本或图像会限制性能，因为过长的序列和数值精度损失。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了科学时间序列专用基准和建模框架的空白，为LLM理解和生成复杂时间科学数据铺平了道路。

Abstract: The scientific reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) has recently
attracted significant attention. Time series, as a fundamental modality in
scientific data, presents unique challenges that are often overlooked in
current multimodal LLMs, which either encode numerical sequences as text or
convert them into images. Such approaches may be insufficient for comprehensive
scientific time series understanding and generation. Existing unified time
series models typically specialise in either forecasting or analysis, and their
effectiveness on non-periodic, heterogeneous scientific signals remains
unclear. To address these gaps, we introduce SciTS, a benchmark spanning 12
scientific domains and 43 tasks, with over 50k+ instances, both univariate and
multivariate signals ranging from $10^0$ to $10^7$ in length and up to 10~MHz
in frequency. We benchmark 17 models, including text-only LLMs, multimodal
LLMs, and unified time series models, and find that general-purpose LLMs
exhibit stronger generalisability than specialised time series models, while
representing time series as text or images limits their performance due to
excessively long sequences and loss of numerical precision, respectively. We
then introduce TimeOmni, a framework that equips LLMs with the ability to
understand and generate time series while remaining compatible with
general-purpose LLM training. This work fills a gap in both dedicated
benchmarks and modelling frameworks for scientific time series, paving the way
for LLMs to understand and generate complex temporal scientific data.

TL;DR: Triple-BERT是一种基于BERT的集中式单智能体强化学习方法，用于网约车平台的大规模订单调度，通过动作分解策略和参数共享机制解决了高维动作空间和观测空间的挑战，在真实数据集上比现有方法提升了11.95%的性能。

Abstract: On-demand ride-sharing platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, face the intricate
real-time challenge of bundling and matching passengers-each with distinct
origins and destinations-to available vehicles, all while navigating
significant system uncertainties. Due to the extensive observation space
arising from the large number of drivers and orders, order dispatching, though
fundamentally a centralized task, is often addressed using Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, independent MARL methods fail to
capture global information and exhibit poor cooperation among workers, while
Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL methods suffer from
the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these challenges, we propose
Triple-BERT, a centralized Single Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method
designed specifically for large-scale order dispatching on ride-sharing
platforms. Built on a variant TD3, our approach addresses the vast action space
through an action decomposition strategy that breaks down the joint action
probability into individual driver action probabilities. To handle the
extensive observation space, we introduce a novel BERT-based network, where
parameter reuse mitigates parameter growth as the number of drivers and orders
increases, and the attention mechanism effectively captures the complex
relationships among the large pool of driver and orders. We validate our method
using a real-world ride-hailing dataset from Manhattan. Triple-BERT achieves
approximately an 11.95% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, with
a 4.26% increase in served orders and a 22.25% reduction in pickup times. Our
code, trained model parameters, and processed data are publicly available at
the repository https://github.com/RS2002/Triple-BERT .

TL;DR: 提出了POEM方法，通过探索先前未利用的可靠样本来改进测试时适应(TTA)，解决了现有方法对熵阈值的敏感性问题和样本利用不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法依赖熵作为置信度指标，对预定义的熵阈值敏感，导致许多潜在可靠的目标样本被忽略和利用不足。这些样本可以提供稳定的监督信息和正常范围的梯度来指导模型适应。

Method: 提出POEM方法，通过探索先前未利用的可靠样本来促进TTA，并引入额外的Adapt Branch网络来平衡提取领域无关表示和在目标数据上实现高性能。

Result: 在多种架构上的综合实验表明，POEM在挑战性场景和真实世界领域偏移中始终优于现有TTA方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: POEM是一种有效的TTA方法，其核心思想可以作为增强策略来提升现有TTA方法的性能。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to transfer knowledge from a source model to
unknown test data with potential distribution shifts in an online manner. Many
existing TTA methods rely on entropy as a confidence metric to optimize the
model. However, these approaches are sensitive to the predefined entropy
threshold, influencing which samples are chosen for model adaptation.
Consequently, potentially reliable target samples are often overlooked and
underutilized. For instance, a sample's entropy might slightly exceed the
threshold initially, but fall below it after the model is updated. Such samples
can provide stable supervised information and offer a normal range of gradients
to guide model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a general approach,
\underline{POEM}, to promote TTA via ex\underline{\textbf{p}}loring the
previously unexpl\underline{\textbf{o}}red reliabl\underline{\textbf{e}}
sa\underline{\textbf{m}}ples. Additionally, we introduce an extra Adapt Branch
network to strike a balance between extracting domain-agnostic representations
and achieving high performance on target data. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple architectures demonstrate that POEM consistently outperforms existing
TTA methods in both challenging scenarios and real-world domain shifts, while
remaining computationally efficient. The effectiveness of POEM is evaluated
through extensive analyses and thorough ablation studies. Moreover, the core
idea behind POEM can be employed as an augmentation strategy to boost the
performance of existing TTA approaches. The source code is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型缺乏元认知能力，即模型不知道如何思考自身推理过程，导致真实推理路径与元预测之间存在严重不对齐问题。

Method: 设计MASA训练管道，通过自我生成信号训练元认知能力，过滤零方差提示和截断低效推理路径来提高训练效率。

Result: 在数学基准上平均准确率提升6.2%，AIME25提升19.3%，训练速度提升1.28倍，在13个跨领域基准上泛化性能提升2.08%。

Conclusion: 元认知对齐是提升推理模型性能的关键，MASA方法能有效增强模型的元认知能力，实现性能提升和训练效率优化。

Abstract: Recent studies on reasoning models explore the meta-awareness of language
models, the ability to know how to think by itself. We argue that large
reasoning models lack this meta-awareness property by proving severe
misalignment between true rollouts and predicted meta information. We posit
that aligning meta-prediction with true rollouts will lead to significant
performance gains. To verify this hypothesis, we design a training pipeline
that boosts Meta-Awareness via Self-Alignment (MASA), and prove that enhanced
meta-awareness directly translates to improved accuracy. Unlike existing
meta-cognitive reasoning models, our method does not require external training
sources but leverages self-generated signals to train meta-awareness. Moreover,
our method enables efficient training by i) filtering out zero-variance prompts
that are either trivial or unsolvable and ii) cutting off lengthy rollouts when
they are unlikely to lead to correct answers. The results are inspiring: our
strategy yields significant improvements in both accuracy and training
efficiency on in-domain tasks and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain
benchmarks. More specifically, our method can speed up GRPO training by over
1.28x to reach the same performance, and achieve a 19.3% gain in accuracy on
AIME25, and a 6.2 % average gain over six mathematics benchmarks. Training with
meta-cognitive guidance enhances out-of-domain generalization, giving a 3.87 %
boost on GPQA-Diamond and a 2.08 % overall accuracy gain across 13 benchmarks
spanning logical, scientific, and coding domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在零样本学习中通过属性选择减少语义空间冗余的方法，包含两种互补的特征选择策略，在五个基准数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本学习中的语义空间通常包含噪声、冗余或不相关属性，这会阻碍性能表现。需要在不访问未见类语义信息的情况下评估属性相关性。

Method: 引入分区方案模拟未见条件，研究两种特征选择策略：基于嵌入特征选择的RFS方法和基于进化计算的GA方法。

Result: 在AWA2、CUB、SUN、aPY、FLO五个数据集上的实验表明，两种方法都能通过减少冗余持续提高未见类的准确率，但各有优势：RFS高效但依赖超参数，GA搜索更广但成本更高。

Conclusion: 语义空间本质上是冗余的，提出的分区方案是在归纳条件下精炼语义空间的有效工具。

Abstract: Zero-Shot Learning is an important paradigm within General-Purpose Artificial
Intelligence Systems, particularly in those that operate in open-world
scenarios where systems must adapt to new tasks dynamically. Semantic spaces
play a pivotal role as they bridge seen and unseen classes, but whether
human-annotated or generated by a machine learning model, they often contain
noisy, redundant, or irrelevant attributes that hinder performance. To address
this, we introduce a partitioning scheme that simulates unseen conditions in an
inductive setting (which is the most challenging), allowing attribute relevance
to be assessed without access to semantic information from unseen classes.
Within this framework, we study two complementary feature-selection strategies
and assess their generalisation. The first adapts embedded feature selection to
the particular demands of ZSL, turning model-driven rankings into meaningful
semantic pruning; the second leverages evolutionary computation to directly
explore the space of attribute subsets more broadly. Experiments on five
benchmark datasets (AWA2, CUB, SUN, aPY, FLO) show that both methods
consistently improve accuracy on unseen classes by reducing redundancy, but in
complementary ways: RFS is efficient and competitive though dependent on
critical hyperparameters, whereas GA is more costly yet explores the search
space more broadly and avoids such dependence. These results confirm that
semantic spaces are inherently redundant and highlight the proposed
partitioning scheme as an effective tool to refine them under inductive
conditions.

Result: 实现了准确且低成本的温度和热通量场预测，为灵活通用的热误差校正提供了基础。

Conclusion: 该方法为机床环境中的热误差校正提供了一种灵活且可推广的新范式。

Abstract: Thermal errors in machine tools significantly impact machining precision and
productivity. Traditional thermal error correction/compensation methods rely on
measured temperature-deformation fields or on transfer functions. Most existing
data-driven compensation strategies employ neural networks (NNs) to directly
predict thermal errors or specific compensation values. While effective, these
approaches are tightly bound to particular error types, spatial locations, or
machine configurations, limiting their generality and adaptability. In this
work, we introduce a novel paradigm in which NNs are trained to predict
high-fidelity temperature and heat flux fields within the machine tool. The
proposed framework enables subsequent computation and correction of a wide
range of error types using modular, swappable downstream components. The NN is
trained using data obtained with the finite element method under varying
initial conditions and incorporates a correlation-based selection strategy that
identifies the most informative measurement points, minimising hardware
requirements during inference. We further benchmark state-of-the-art
time-series NN architectures, namely Recurrent NN, Gated Recurrent Unit,
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Transformer, and Temporal
Convolutional Network, by training both specialised models, tailored for
specific initial conditions, and general models, capable of extrapolating to
unseen scenarios. The results show accurate and low-cost prediction of
temperature and heat flux fields, laying the basis for enabling flexible and
generalisable thermal error correction in machine tool environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了正交蒙特卡洛Dropout方法，在组合稀疏语义向量时强制执行严格正交性且不增加时间复杂度，但实证分析发现这种正交性并不能实现语义解缠或组合性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA作为大型模型的流行微调方法，在合并多个LoRA模块（如生成特定风格的物体）时，它们的语义向量可能会相互干扰，需要解决这种干扰问题。

Method: 提出正交蒙特卡洛Dropout机制，在理论和运行时层面保证合并的LoRA保持正交，从而避免直接干扰。

Result: 方法成功实现了LoRA的正交合并，但实证分析表明这种正交性并不能带来语义解缠或组合性。

Conclusion: 仅靠LoRA间的正交性可能不足以实现真正的语义组合性，需要重新审视其在适配器合并中的作用。

Abstract: We propose Orthogonal Monte Carlo Dropout, a mechanism that enforces strict
orthogonality when combining sparse semantic vectors without extra time
complexity. LoRA, a popular fine-tuning method for large models, typically
trains a module to represent a specific concept such as an object or a style.
When multiple LoRAs are merged, for example to generate an object in a
particular style, their semantic vectors may interfere with each other. Our
method guarantees, at the theoretical and runtime levels, that merged LoRAs
remain orthogonal and thus free from direct interference. However, empirical
analysis reveals that such orthogonality does not lead to the semantic
disentanglement or compositionality highlighted in prior work on compositional
adaptation. This finding suggests that inter-LoRA orthogonality alone may be
insufficient for achieving true semantic compositionality, prompting a
re-examination of its role in adapter merging.

Motivation: 现代文本到图像模型生成逼真视觉内容的能力带来了严重问题：可能被滥用以创建有害、欺骗性或非法内容。这加速了对机器遗忘的需求，该领域旨在从模型训练数据中选择性移除特定知识而不影响整体性能。

Method: 提出记忆自再生任务和MemoRa策略，这是一种支持有效恢复先前丢失知识的再生方法。同时提出知识检索鲁棒性作为机器遗忘技术的重要评估指标。

Result: 研究表明模型暴露于对抗性提示攻击时能够生成所谓的未学习概念，这可能有害且非法。遗忘以两种不同方式发生：短期遗忘可以快速回忆，长期遗忘恢复更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 知识检索鲁棒性是开发更强大有效遗忘技术的关键但尚未充分探索的评估指标。遗忘存在短期和长期两种模式，其中长期遗忘的恢复更加困难。

Abstract: The impressive capability of modern text-to-image models to generate
realistic visuals has come with a serious drawback: they can be misused to
create harmful, deceptive or unlawful content. This has accelerated the push
for machine unlearning. This new field seeks to selectively remove specific
knowledge from a model's training data without causing a drop in its overall
performance. However, it turns out that actually forgetting a given concept is
an extremely difficult task. Models exposed to attacks using adversarial
prompts show the ability to generate so-called unlearned concepts, which can be
not only harmful but also illegal. In this paper, we present considerations
regarding the ability of models to forget and recall knowledge, introducing the
Memory Self-Regeneration task. Furthermore, we present MemoRa strategy, which
we consider to be a regenerative approach supporting the effective recovery of
previously lost knowledge. Moreover, we propose that robustness in knowledge
retrieval is a crucial yet underexplored evaluation measure for developing more
robust and effective unlearning techniques. Finally, we demonstrate that
forgetting occurs in two distinct ways: short-term, where concepts can be
quickly recalled, and long-term, where recovery is more challenging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM增强推理能力的范式主要依赖于后训练阶段的高质量推理数据，但推理数据在预训练阶段的作用尚不明确。由于前沿模型的预训练语料不透明，不同阶段引入推理数据的效果缺乏系统研究。

Method: 通过系统研究推理数据在不同训练阶段（预训练和指令微调）的影响，分析数据规模、多样性和质量对模型性能的影响，比较不同阶段引入推理数据的效果。

Result: 预训练阶段引入推理数据至关重要（平均提升19%），能建立指令微调无法完全复制的基础能力。预训练受益于推理模式的多样性（平均提升11%），而指令微调更依赖数据质量（平均提升15%）。高质量预训练数据具有潜在效应，仅在指令微调后激活。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了语言建模与推理的传统分离，为在整个训练流程中战略性分配数据提供了原则性指导，以构建更强大的模型。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs
revolves around post-training on high-quality, reasoning-intensive data. While
emerging literature suggests that reasoning data is increasingly incorporated
also during the mid-training stage-a practice that is relatively more
proprietary and less openly characterized-the role of such data in pretraining
remains unclear. In particular, due to the opaqueness of pretraining corpora in
most frontier models, the effect of reasoning data introduced at different
phases of pre- and/or post-training is relatively less reported in the
scientific literature. This raises several important questions: Is adding
reasoning data earlier during pretraining any better than introducing it during
post-training? Could earlier inclusion risk overfitting and harm
generalization, or instead establish durable foundations that later fine-tuning
cannot recover? We conduct the first systematic study of how reasoning
data-varying in scale, diversity, and quality-affects LLM performance when
introduced at different stages of training. We find that front-loading
reasoning data into pretraining is critical (19% avg gain), establishing
foundational capabilities that cannot be fully replicated by later-stage SFT,
even with more data. We uncover an asymmetric principle for optimal data
allocation: pretraining benefits most from broad diversity in reasoning
patterns (11% avg gain), while SFT is more sensitive to data quality (15% avg
gain). We show that high-quality pretraining data has latent effects, activated
only after SFT, and that naively scaling SFT data can be detrimental, washing
away the benefits of early reasoning injection. Our results challenge the
conventional separation of language modeling and reasoning, providing a
principled guide for strategically allocating data across the entire training
pipeline to build more capable models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模基础模型在语言、视觉和推理任务中表现出色，但其内部如何组织和稳定概念仍不清楚。

Method: 基于概念树构建MindCraft框架，在每一层应用谱分解，将主方向连接成分支概念路径。

Result: 在医疗诊断、物理推理和政治决策等多个领域的实证评估表明，概念树能够恢复语义层次、解耦潜在概念，并具有广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 概念树建立了一个广泛适用且强大的框架，能够深入分析深度模型中的概念表示，是迈向可解释AI的重要一步。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models demonstrate strong performance across language,
vision, and reasoning tasks. However, how they internally structure and
stabilize concepts remains elusive. Inspired by causal inference, we introduce
the MindCraft framework built upon Concept Trees. By applying spectral
decomposition at each layer and linking principal directions into branching
Concept Paths, Concept Trees reconstruct the hierarchical emergence of
concepts, revealing exactly when they diverge from shared representations into
linearly separable subspaces. Empirical evaluations across diverse scenarios
across disciplines, including medical diagnosis, physics reasoning, and
political decision-making, show that Concept Trees recover semantic
hierarchies, disentangle latent concepts, and can be widely applied across
multiple domains. The Concept Tree establishes a widely applicable and powerful
framework that enables in-depth analysis of conceptual representations in deep
models, marking a significant step forward in the foundation of interpretable
AI.

TL;DR: 本研究应用变分自编码器(VAE)检测美国大陆四个AR6区域的GPP极端事件，与传统SSA方法比较，发现VAE在捕捉碳循环非线性依赖方面具有计算优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候异常显著影响陆地碳循环动态，需要可靠的方法来检测和分析植物生产力的异常行为。

Method: 使用变分自编码器架构，包含三个密集层和潜在空间，输入序列长度为12个月，通过重构误差识别GPP异常。与传统奇异谱分析方法在三个时间段进行比较。

Result: VAE和SSA方法在极端事件空间模式上表现出强区域一致性，但VAE阈值更高。两种方法均显示到2050-80年，北美西部和中部的负碳循环极端事件幅度和频率增加。

Conclusion: VAE方法与成熟的SSA技术性能相当，同时具有计算优势，并能更好地捕捉碳循环变率中的非线性时间依赖性，无需预先定义数据中的信号周期性。

Abstract: Climate anomalies significantly impact terrestrial carbon cycle dynamics,
necessitating robust methods for detecting and analyzing anomalous behavior in
plant productivity. This study presents a novel application of variational
autoencoders (VAE) for identifying extreme events in gross primary productivity
(GPP) from Community Earth System Model version 2 simulations across four AR6
regions in the Continental United States. We compare VAE-based anomaly
detection with traditional singular spectral analysis (SSA) methods across
three time periods: 1850-80, 1950-80, and 2050-80 under the SSP585 scenario.
The VAE architecture employs three dense layers and a latent space with an
input sequence length of 12 months, trained on a normalized GPP time series to
reconstruct the GPP and identifying anomalies based on reconstruction errors.
Extreme events are defined using 5th percentile thresholds applied to both VAE
and SSA anomalies. Results demonstrate strong regional agreement between VAE
and SSA methods in spatial patterns of extreme event frequencies, despite VAE
producing higher threshold values (179-756 GgC for VAE vs. 100-784 GgC for SSA
across regions and periods). Both methods reveal increasing magnitudes and
frequencies of negative carbon cycle extremes toward 2050-80, particularly in
Western and Central North America. The VAE approach shows comparable
performance to established SSA techniques, while offering computational
advantages and enhanced capability for capturing non-linear temporal
dependencies in carbon cycle variability. Unlike SSA, the VAE method does not
require one to define the periodicity of the signals in the data; it discovers
them from the data.

TL;DR: PT²-LLM是一个专为大型语言模型设计的后训练三值化框架，通过非对称三值量化器和两阶段优化流程，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低内存需求和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然功能强大，但内存和计算需求巨大阻碍了部署。三值化作为有前景的压缩技术，在后训练量化场景下的潜力尚未充分探索，主要面临训练自由参数优化困难以及异常值和分散权重带来的量化挑战。

Method: 提出PT²-LLM框架，核心包括：1）非对称三值量化器，采用两阶段优化：迭代三值拟合交替构建最优三值网格和灵活舍入；激活感知网格对齐进一步优化网格匹配全精度输出。2）基于结构相似性的重排序策略，利用列间结构相似性缓解量化难度和异常值影响。

Result: 大量实验表明，PT²-LLM在保持与最先进2位后训练量化方法竞争力同时，具有更低的内存成本，并能加速预填充和解码过程，实现端到端加速。

Conclusion: PT²-LLM为大型语言模型提供了一种有效的后训练三值化解决方案，在压缩比、性能和推理速度方面取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, but their large memory and compute demands hinder deployment.
Ternarization has gained attention as a promising compression technique,
delivering substantial size reduction and high computational efficiency.
However, its potential in the post-training quantization (PTQ) setting remains
underexplored, due to the challenge of training-free parameter optimization and
the quantization difficulty posed by outliers and dispersed weights. To address
these issues, we propose PT$^2$-LLM, a post-training ternarization framework
tailored for LLMs. At its core is an Asymmetric Ternary Quantizer equipped with
a two-stage refinement pipeline: (1) Iterative Ternary Fitting (ITF), which
alternates between optimal ternary grid construction and flexible rounding to
minimize quantization error, and (2) Activation-aware Grid Alignment (AGA),
which further refines the ternary grid to better match full-precision outputs.
In addition, we propose a plug-and-play Structural Similarity-based Reordering
(SSR) strategy that leverages inter-column structural similarity to ease
quantization and mitigate outlier effects, further enhancing overall
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PT$^2$-LLM delivers
competitive performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) 2-bit PTQ methods with
lower memory cost, while also accelerating both prefill and decoding to achieve
end-to-end speedup. The code and models will be available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个理论框架分析多模态对比学习的模态间隙现象，证明维度坍缩是模态间隙的根本原因，并提出了两种实现完美模态对齐的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态对比学习中存在模态间隙现象，即不同模态的表示占据嵌入空间的不同区域。现有研究对模态间隙如何影响下游性能存在不一致的发现，需要从理论上解释其成因和影响。

Method: 建立理论框架分析MCL的收敛最优表示和模态对齐，在不同约束条件下（无约束、锥约束、子空间约束）推导模态间隙的收敛行为。

Result: 证明在无约束或锥约束下模态间隙收敛到零；在子空间约束下（维度坍缩导致）模态间隙收敛到两个超平面间的最小角度，识别维度坍缩为模态间隙的根本原因。

Conclusion: 模态间隙通过影响样本对的对齐来影响下游性能，提出了通过超平面旋转和共享空间投影两种方法实现完美模态对齐。

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning (MCL) aims to embed data from different
modalities in a shared embedding space. However, empirical evidence shows that
representations from different modalities occupy completely separate regions of
embedding space, a phenomenon referred to as the modality gap. Moreover,
experimental findings on how the size of the modality gap influences downstream
performance are inconsistent. These observations raise two key questions: (1)
What causes the modality gap? (2) How does it affect downstream tasks? To
address these questions, this paper introduces the first theoretical framework
for analyzing the convergent optimal representations of MCL and the modality
alignment when training is optimized. Specifically, we prove that without any
constraint or under the cone constraint, the modality gap converges to zero.
Under the subspace constraint (i.e., representations of two modalities fall
into two distinct hyperplanes due to dimension collapse), the modality gap
converges to the smallest angle between the two hyperplanes. This result
identifies \emph{dimension collapse} as the fundamental origin of the modality
gap. Furthermore, our theorems demonstrate that paired samples cannot be
perfectly aligned under the subspace constraint. The modality gap influences
downstream performance by affecting the alignment between sample pairs. We
prove that, in this case, perfect alignment between two modalities can still be
achieved via two ways: hyperplane rotation and shared space projection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于KL或α-散度正则化的探索奖励方法未能实现真正的乐观探索，反而偏向参考模型的高概率区域，限制了在不确定区域的发现能力。

Method: 提出了通用探索奖励(GEB)框架，通过参考依赖的奖励调节来抵消散度引起的偏差，统一了先前的启发式奖励方法，并自然扩展到完整的α-散度族。

Result: 在多个散度设置和大语言模型骨干上的对齐任务中，GEB始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GEB为RLHF中的乐观探索提供了既有理论依据又实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in
reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus
methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or
$\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward
high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing
conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To
address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel
theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB
counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation
and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally
across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently
outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings
and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers
both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.

TL;DR: 提出决策势能面(DPS)作为分析大语言模型决策边界的新概念，通过有限次序列采样近似构建LLM的决策边界，解决了传统方法计算不可行的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法分析大语言模型的决策边界在计算上不可行，因为词汇序列空间巨大且模型具有自回归特性，需要新的分析工具。

Method: 定义决策势能面(DPS)，基于输入对不同采样序列的区分置信度来捕捉决策边界潜力。提出K-DPS算法，仅需K次有限序列采样即可近似LLM的决策边界。

Result: 理论推导了K-DPS与理想DPS之间的绝对误差、期望误差和误差集中度的上界，证明误差可通过采样次数进行权衡。实验验证了方法在各种LLM和语料上的有效性。

Conclusion: DPS为分析LLM决策边界提供了可行的替代方案，K-DPS算法能以可控误差高效近似决策边界，为理解LLM行为提供了新工具。

Abstract: Decision boundary, the subspace of inputs where a machine learning model
assigns equal classification probabilities to two classes, is pivotal in
revealing core model properties and interpreting behaviors. While analyzing the
decision boundary of large language models (LLMs) has raised increasing
attention recently, constructing it for mainstream LLMs remains computationally
infeasible due to the enormous vocabulary-sequence sizes and the
auto-regressive nature of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper we propose
Decision Potential Surface (DPS), a new notion for analyzing LLM decision
boundary. DPS is defined on the confidences in distinguishing different
sampling sequences for each input, which naturally captures the potential of
decision boundary. We prove that the zero-height isohypse in DPS is equivalent
to the decision boundary of an LLM, with enclosed regions representing decision
regions. By leveraging DPS, for the first time in the literature, we propose an
approximate decision boundary construction algorithm, namely $K$-DPS, which
only requires K-finite times of sequence sampling to approximate an LLM's
decision boundary with negligible error. We theoretically derive the upper
bounds for the absolute error, expected error, and the error concentration
between K-DPS and the ideal DPS, demonstrating that such errors can be
trade-off with sampling times. Our results are empirically validated by
extensive experiments across various LLMs and corpora.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在AI领域取得了革命性成功，但对其内部机制的理论理解仍然不足，需要建立更严谨的数学分析框架。

Method: 提出将离散的Transformer层结构映射为连续PDE动力系统，自注意力对应非局部相互作用，前馈网络对应局部反应，残差连接和层归一化对应稳定化机制。

Result: 实验证明：没有残差连接会导致表征漂移，没有层归一化会导致训练爆炸性不稳定，这些组件是系统稳定所必需的数学稳定器。

Conclusion: Transformer设计中的启发式技巧实际上是稳定强大但固有不稳定连续系统的数学必需品，为深度神经网络分析提供了连续动力学的新范式。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet
a principled theoretical understanding of its internal mechanisms remains
elusive. This paper introduces a novel analytical framework that
reconceptualizes the Transformer's discrete, layered structure as a continuous
spatiotemporal dynamical system governed by a master Partial Differential
Equation (PDE). Within this paradigm, we map core architectural components to
distinct mathematical operators: self-attention as a non-local interaction, the
feed-forward network as a local reaction, and, critically, residual connections
and layer normalization as indispensable stabilization mechanisms. We do not
propose a new model, but rather employ the PDE system as a theoretical probe to
analyze the mathematical necessity of these components. By comparing a standard
Transformer with a PDE simulator that lacks explicit stabilizers, our
experiments provide compelling empirical evidence for our central thesis. We
demonstrate that without residual connections, the system suffers from
catastrophic representational drift, while the absence of layer normalization
leads to unstable, explosive training dynamics. Our findings reveal that these
seemingly heuristic "tricks" are, in fact, fundamental mathematical stabilizers
required to tame an otherwise powerful but inherently unstable continuous
system. This work offers a first-principles explanation for the Transformer's
design and establishes a new paradigm for analyzing deep neural networks
through the lens of continuous dynamics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Synergistic Information Distillation (SID)框架，通过将深度学习重构为局部协同精炼问题的级联，解决了反向传播的更新锁定和高内存消耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播(BP)存在两个关键可扩展性瓶颈：更新锁定（网络模块需等待整个反向传播完成）和因存储激活值导致的高内存消耗。

Method: 将深度网络构建为模块管道，每个模块施加局部目标来精炼关于真实目标的概率信念。该目标平衡对目标的保真度和与前一个模块信念的一致性，解耦模块间的反向依赖。

Result: SID消除了更新锁定，大幅减少内存需求，同时保持标准前向推理过程。理论证明SID保证网络深度增加时的单调性能提升。

Conclusion: SID在分类准确率上匹配或超越BP，展现出优越的可扩展性和对标签噪声的鲁棒性，可作为BP的直接替代方案。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP), while foundational to deep learning, imposes two
critical scalability bottlenecks: update locking, where network modules remain
idle until the entire backward pass completes, and high memory consumption due
to storing activations for gradient computation. To address these limitations,
we introduce Synergistic Information Distillation (SID), a novel training
framework that reframes deep learning as a cascade of local cooperative
refinement problems. In SID, a deep network is structured as a pipeline of
modules, each imposed with a local objective to refine a probabilistic belief
about the ground-truth target. This objective balances fidelity to the target
with consistency to the belief from its preceding module. By decoupling the
backward dependencies between modules, SID enables parallel training and hence
eliminates update locking and drastically reduces memory requirements.
Meanwhile, this design preserves the standard feed-forward inference pass,
making SID a versatile drop-in replacement for BP. We provide a theoretical
foundation, proving that SID guarantees monotonic performance improvement with
network depth. Empirically, SID consistently matches or surpasses the
classification accuracy of BP, exhibiting superior scalability and pronounced
robustness to label noise.Code is available at:

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型具有双向上下文和灵活掩码去噪生成的优势，但模型尺寸持续增长需要权重压缩。现有后训练量化方法直接应用于扩散模型在2位精度下性能不佳。

Method: 1) 掩码校准模拟：对齐校准与时序相关掩码；2) 数据感知任意顺序量化器：通过优化算法学习超低位权重表示；3) 自适应块级混合精度：基于敏感度的精度分配方案。

Conclusion: Quant-dLLM是针对扩散大语言模型的有效超低位量化框架，解决了标准后训练量化方法在该类模型上的性能问题。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs), which offer bidirectional context
and flexible masked-denoising generation, are emerging as a compelling
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs. However, like AR LLMs, their model
sizes continue to grow, motivating weight compression for deployment. Although
post-training quantization (PTQ) is effective for AR LLMs, directly
transferring it to dLLMs at 2-bit leads to unsatisfactory performance. To
tackle these challenges, we propose Quant-dLLM, an ultra-low-bit PTQ framework
tailored to dLLMs. Since masked-denoising activations in dLLMs differ from the
fully visible signals assumed by standard PTQ methods, we introduce Masked
Calibration Simulation (MCS) to align calibration with the timestep-dependent
masking, which yields more reliable calibrations. Moreover, we propose a
Data-aware Any-order Quantizer (DAQ) that learns ultra-low-bit weight
representations via an optimization algorithm. It performs iterative
approximation guided by our simulated calibration data. In addition, under a
strict 2-bit budget, we introduce Adaptive Blockwise Mixed Precision (ABMP), a
sensitivity-based precision allocation scheme that adaptively assigns bit width
across channel groups. When restricted to 2-bit precision, Quant-dLLM
consistently achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art (SOTA) AR-transfer
PTQ methods on dLLMs. The code and models will be available at:

Motivation: 大语言模型面临显著的计算和内存挑战，需要极低比特量化来实现高效部署。

Method: 使用上采样结合Sigma-Delta量化器将LLM权重二值化或三值化，采用Hadamard权重平滑减少精度损失，并提出分层和线性级的OSR分配策略MultiOSR。

Result: 在OPT和LLaMA模型系列上的实验表明，SDQ-LLM在高度激进的低OSR设置下实现了更高效和高精度的性能。

Conclusion: SDQ-LLM框架通过连续可调的OSR和精细的量化策略，为极低比特LLM量化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory
challenges, making extremely low-bit quantization crucial for their efficient
deployment. In this work, we introduce SDQ-LLM: Sigma-Delta Quantization for
1-bit LLMs of any size, a novel framework that enables extremely low-bit
quantization of LLMs while preserving their linguistic reasoning capabilities.
A distinctive feature of SDQ-LLM is the continuous adjustability of the
Over-Sampling Ratio (OSR), enabling dynamic adaptation to memory or VRAM
constraints by selecting fractional OSR (e.g. 2.5 times) for an optimal
trade-off between model size and accuracy. SDQ-LLM uses upsampling combined
with Sigma-Delta Quantizer to binarize or ternarize LLMs weights, encoding
high-precision parameters into 1-bit or 1.58-bit representations, replacing the
multiplication operations within linear layers with addition. This approach
significantly enhances inference efficiency under extremely low-bit
quantization. To further reduce the loss of quantization precision, we
incorporate Hadamard-based weight smoothing prior to quantization, improving
the stability and robustness of the weight representations. Furthermore, to
fully leverage the continuity of the OSR and reduce precision loss, recognizing
the correlation between quantization sensitivity and weight variance, we
propose a fine-grained, layer- and linear-wise OSR allocation strategy,
MultiOSR. This strategy distributes OSR both across layers and within each
layer, based on weight variance and parameter scale. Finally, extensive
experiments on OPT and LLaMA model families demonstrate that SDQ-LLM achieves a
more efficient and high-precision performance even under highly aggressive
low-OSR settings. Our code is available at

Abstract: The combination of linear transformations and non-linear activation functions
forms the foundation of most modern deep neural networks, enabling them to
approximate highly complex functions. This paper explores the introduction of
quadratic transformations to further increase nonlinearity in neural networks,
with the aim of enhancing the performance of existing architectures. To reduce
parameter complexity and computational complexity, we propose a lightweight
quadratic enhancer that uses low-rankness, weight sharing, and sparsification
techniques. For a fixed architecture, the proposed approach introduces
quadratic interactions between features at every layer, while only adding
negligible amounts of additional model parameters and forward computations. We
conduct a set of proof-of-concept experiments for the proposed method across
three tasks: image classification, text classification, and fine-tuning
large-language models. In all tasks, the proposed approach demonstrates clear
and substantial performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要澄清单个物理约束如何影响贝叶斯物理信息神经网络，因为物理约束可能导致网络过度自信，这种过度自信可能反映了约束强制带来的合理精度，而非校准错误。

Method: 引入可扩展的矩阵自由拉普拉斯框架，将后验Hessian矩阵分解为每个约束的贡献，并提供量化指标来衡量它们在损失曲面上的相对影响力。

Result: 应用于Van der Pol方程时，该方法能够追踪约束如何塑造网络的几何结构，并通过Hessian矩阵直接显示单个损失权重的变化如何非平凡地重新分布曲率和有效主导地位。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解贝叶斯物理信息神经网络中物理约束的影响提供了新的分析工具，有助于更准确地解释网络的不确定性和过度自信问题。

Abstract: Bayesian physics-informed neural networks (B-PINNs) merge data with governing
equations to solve differential equations under uncertainty. However,
interpreting uncertainty and overconfidence in B-PINNs requires care due to the
poorly understood effects the physical constraints have on the network;
overconfidence could reflect warranted precision, enforced by the constraints,
rather than miscalibration. Motivated by the need to further clarify how
individual physical constraints shape these networks, we introduce a scalable,
matrix-free Laplace framework that decomposes the posterior Hessian into
contributions from each constraint and provides metrics to quantify their
relative influence on the loss landscape. Applied to the Van der Pol equation,
our method tracks how constraints sculpt the network's geometry and shows,
directly through the Hessian, how changing a single loss weight non-trivially
redistributes curvature and effective dominance across the others.

TL;DR: MemMamba通过状态摘要机制和交叉注意力，解决了Mamba模型长程记忆指数衰减问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时显著提升了长序列建模性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长序列建模方法在效率和内存之间存在固有权衡：RNN存在梯度消失问题，Transformer受限于二次复杂度，而Mamba等选择性状态空间模型虽然高效但长程记忆会指数衰减。

Method: 提出MemMamba框架，集成状态摘要机制以及跨层和跨token注意力，模拟人类阅读长文档时提炼和保留关键信息的过程。

Result: 在PG19和Passkey Retrieval等长序列基准测试中显著优于现有Mamba变体和Transformer，推理效率提升48%。

Conclusion: MemMamba在复杂度-内存权衡上取得突破，为超长序列建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of data, long-sequence modeling has become
increasingly important in tasks such as natural language processing and
bioinformatics. However, existing methods face inherent trade-offs between
efficiency and memory. Recurrent neural networks suffer from gradient vanishing
and explosion, making them hard to scale. Transformers can model global
dependencies but are constrained by quadratic complexity. Recently, selective
state-space models such as Mamba have demonstrated high efficiency with O(n)
time and O(1) recurrent inference, yet their long-range memory decays
exponentially. In this work, we conduct mathematical derivations and
information-theoretic analysis to systematically uncover the memory decay
mechanism of Mamba, answering a fundamental question: what is the nature of
Mamba's long-range memory and how does it retain information? To quantify key
information loss, we further introduce horizontal-vertical memory fidelity
metrics that capture degradation both within and across layers. Inspired by how
humans distill and retain salient information when reading long documents, we
propose MemMamba, a novel architectural framework that integrates state
summarization mechanism together with cross-layer and cross-token attention,
which alleviates long-range forgetting while preserving linear complexity.
MemMamba achieves significant improvements over existing Mamba variants and
Transformers on long-sequence benchmarks such as PG19 and Passkey Retrieval,
while delivering a 48% speedup in inference efficiency. Both theoretical
analysis and empirical results demonstrate that MemMamba achieves a
breakthrough in the complexity-memory trade-off, offering a new paradigm for
ultra-long sequence modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出混合归因和剪枝（HAP）框架，结合归因修补的速度优势和边缘剪枝的忠实性，在保持电路忠实性的同时将速度提升46%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电路发现算法面临基本权衡：归因修补速度快但不忠实于完整模型，而边缘剪枝忠实但计算成本高。需要一种能兼顾速度和忠实性的方法。

Method: 使用归因修补识别高潜力子图，然后应用边缘剪枝从中提取忠实电路。

Result: HAP比基线算法快46%，且不牺牲电路忠实性。在间接宾语识别任务中，该方法保留了归因修补方法在高稀疏度下会剪枝的协作电路组件。

Conclusion: HAP可以成为提高机制可解释性研究扩展到更大模型的有效方法。

Abstract: Interpreting language models often involves circuit analysis, which aims to
identify sparse subnetworks, or circuits, that accomplish specific tasks.
Existing circuit discovery algorithms face a fundamental trade-off: attribution
patching is fast but unfaithful to the full model, while edge pruning is
faithful but computationally expensive. This research proposes a hybrid
attribution and pruning (HAP) framework that uses attribution patching to
identify a high-potential subgraph, then applies edge pruning to extract a
faithful circuit from it. We show that HAP is 46\% faster than baseline
algorithms without sacrificing circuit faithfulness. Furthermore, we present a
case study on the Indirect Object Identification task, showing that our method
preserves cooperative circuit components (e.g. S-inhibition heads) that
attribution patching methods prune at high sparsity. Our results show that HAP
could be an effective approach for improving the scalability of mechanistic
interpretability research to larger models. Our code is available at

*Yufei Li,Yu Fu,Yue Dong,Cong Liu*

TL;DR: MACE是一个混合LLM系统，通过在边缘服务器上协同部署推理和微调任务，实现迭代级调度来平衡推理延迟和模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘服务器上的LLM应用需要频繁重新训练以适应非平稳用户数据，但现有策略无法在有限GPU资源下同时保证推理延迟和模型精度。

Method: 提出MACE系统，通过协同部署推理（预填充、解码）和微调任务，采用智能内存管理和迭代级调度来优化GPU周期分配。

Result: 在跟踪驱动评估中，MACE将推理延迟降低高达63%，保持吞吐量，GPU利用率超过85%，同时匹配或超过持续重新训练的性能。

Conclusion: 迭代级混合调度是在边缘平台上部署具有持续学习能力的LLM的有前景方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deployed on edge servers are increasingly used
in latency-sensitive applications such as personalized assistants,
recommendation, and content moderation. However, the non-stationary nature of
user data necessitates frequent retraining, which introduces a fundamental
tension between inference latency and model accuracy under constrained GPU
resources. Existing retraining strategies either delay model updates,
over-commit resources to retraining, or overlook iteration-level retraining
granularity. In this paper, we identify that iteration-level scheduling is
crucial for adapting retraining frequency to model drift without violating
service-level objectives (SLOs). We propose MACE, a hybrid LLM system that
colocates concurrent inference (prefill, decode) and fine-tuning, with
intelligent memory management to maximize task performance while promising
inference throughput. MACE leverages the insight that not all model updates
equally affect output alignment and allocates GPU cycles accordingly to balance
throughput, latency, and update freshness. Our trace-driven evaluation shows
that MACE matches or exceeds continuous retraining while reducing inference
latency by up to 63% and maintaining throughput under resource constraints.
Compared to periodic retraining, MACE improves latency breakdown across
prefill, decode, and finetune stages, and sustains GPU utilization above 85% in
NVIDIA AGX Orin. These results demonstrate that iteration-level hybrid
scheduling is a promising direction for deploying LLMs with continual learning
capabilities on edge platforms.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习方法如FedAvg在处理大语言模型时因参数规模巨大而失效，需要解决通信和计算开销问题。

Method: 结合联邦学习和4位量化低秩适应(QLORA)，在物联网领域过滤通用数据集进行联邦指令调优。

Result: Edge-FIT调优的Llama 2(7B)模型F1分数达到0.89，使用Phi-3-mini(3.8B)模型也验证了可行的权衡。

Conclusion: Edge-FIT是一个可扩展的框架，适用于在家庭计算网关上部署去中心化LLM。

Abstract: This paper proposes Edge-FIT (Federated Instruction Tuning on the Edge), a
scalable framework for Federated Instruction Tuning (FIT) of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Traditional Federated Learning (TFL) methods, like FedAvg, fail
when confronted with the massive parameter size of LLMs [3], [6]. Our Edge-FIT
framework combines federated learning with 4-bit Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLORA), mitigating the core issues of communication and computational
overhead. We demonstrate this by filtering the general-purpose Databricks Dolly
15k dataset for the IoT domain. Experimental results show the Edge-FIT tuned
Llama 2(7B) achieves an F1-Score of 0.89. We also demonstrate a viable
trade-off using the 3.8B Phi-3-mini model, validating Edge-FIT as a scalable
framework for decentralized LLM deployment on home compute gateways.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有日志异常检测方法严重依赖标注，但大规模日志标注非常困难。迁移学习和主动学习方法存在源-目标系统数据分布差异和冷启动问题。

Method: LogAction整合迁移学习和主动学习：使用成熟系统的标注数据训练基础模型解决冷启动问题；采用基于自由能和不确定性的采样选择分布边界日志进行手动标注，以最小化人工标注解决数据分布差异。

Result: 在六个不同数据集组合上的实验表明，LogAction仅需2%手动标注就能达到93.01%的平均F1分数，优于现有最优方法26.28%。

Conclusion: LogAction通过主动领域自适应有效解决了日志异常检测中的标注依赖、数据分布差异和冷启动问题，在最小化人工标注成本的同时实现了优异的检测性能。

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection is a essential task for ensuring the reliability
and performance of software systems. However, the performance of existing
anomaly detection methods heavily relies on labeling, while labeling a large
volume of logs is highly challenging. To address this issue, many approaches
based on transfer learning and active learning have been proposed.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is hindered by issues such as the gap between
source and target system data distributions and cold-start problems. In this
paper, we propose LogAction, a novel log-based anomaly detection model based on
active domain adaptation. LogAction integrates transfer learning and active
learning techniques. On one hand, it uses labeled data from a mature system to
train a base model, mitigating the cold-start issue in active learning. On the
other hand, LogAction utilize free energy-based sampling and uncertainty-based
sampling to select logs located at the distribution boundaries for manual
labeling, thus addresses the data distribution gap in transfer learning with
minimal human labeling efforts. Experimental results on six different
combinations of datasets demonstrate that LogAction achieves an average 93.01%
F1 score with only 2% of manual labels, outperforming some state-of-the-art
methods by 26.28%. Website: https://logaction.github.io

Conclusion: 虽然掩码扩散模型具有理论优势，但在实际实现并行生成和双向注意力方面存在固有困难，需要通过有效的训练和推理策略来克服。

Abstract: The main advantages of diffusion language models over autoregressive (AR)
models lie in their ability to support parallel generation and bidirectional
attention, enabling a more controllable generation process. In recent years,
open-source mask diffusion language models have emerged, most of which are
based on a variant known as absorbing diffusion. However, this paper
demonstrates why mask diffusion faces inherent difficulties in achieving
parallel generation and bidirectional attention. We also propose the most
effective training and inference strategies for mask diffusion.

Motivation: 随着物理科学对具有等变性网络兴趣的增长，Clifford神经网络层作为实现E(n)和O(n)等变性的方法之一而受到关注。本文旨在优化其计算效率。

Method: 首先分析Clifford代数的理论基础以消除冗余矩阵分配和计算，然后系统应用已建立的优化技术来进一步提升性能。

Result: 在11个函数上实现了平均21.35倍的加速，在6个案例中运行时间与原始PyTorch实现相当或更快，其余案例中性能与原始库保持同一数量级。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和系统优化，成功显著提升了Clifford卷积层的推理性能，为等变神经网络的实际应用提供了更高效的实现方案。

Abstract: Within the growing interest in the physical sciences in developing networks
with equivariance properties, Clifford neural layers shine as one approach that
delivers $E(n)$ and $O(n)$ equivariances given specific group actions. In this
paper, we analyze the inner structure of the computation within Clifford
convolutional layers and propose and implement several optimizations to speed
up the inference process while maintaining correctness. In particular, we begin
by analyzing the theoretical foundations of Clifford algebras to eliminate
redundant matrix allocations and computations, then systematically apply
established optimization techniques to enhance performance further. We report a
final average speedup of 21.35x over the baseline implementation of eleven
functions and runtimes comparable to and faster than the original PyTorch
implementation in six cases. In the remaining cases, we achieve performance in
the same order of magnitude as the original library.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniPruning是一个统一的后训练剪枝框架，结合了局部显著性度量的速度和全局协调的稳定性，通过镜像下降优化实现，无需更新模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型面临高昂的计算和内存成本，现有剪枝方法难以平衡效率和鲁棒性：局部方法在高稀疏度下容易崩溃，而全局方法需要昂贵的权重更新或限制性半结构化格式。

Method: 使用快速层间评分和轻量级全局控制器分配单一稀疏度预算，支持非结构化和半结构化N:M剪枝，通过镜像下降优化实现全局协调。

Result: 在多个预训练LLM家族和标准基准测试中，UniPruning始终提供竞争性或更优的困惑度和零样本准确率。

Conclusion: UniPruning为大规模LLM稀疏化提供了一个高效、原则性和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks
but face prohibitive computational and memory costs. Pruning offers a promising
path by inducing sparsity while preserving architectural flexibility. However,
existing methods struggle to balance efficiency and robustness: local metric
approaches prune layer by layer but often collapse under high sparsity, whereas
global feedback methods enforce consistency at the cost of expensive weight
updates or restrictive semi-structured formats. We present UniPruning, a
unified post-training pruning framework that combines the speed of local
saliency metrics with the stability of global coordination, enabled by a mirror
descent based optimization, all without updating model weights. UniPruning
leverages fast layer-wise scoring and a lightweight global controller to
allocate a single sparsity budget, supporting both unstructured and
semi-structured N :M pruning within one framework. After a brief calibration,
it can generate pruning masks for arbitrary sparsity levels in one shot, and
adapts seamlessly to hardware-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on
multiple pretrained LLM families and standard benchmarks show that UniPruning
consistently delivers competitive or superior perplexity and zero-shot
accuracy. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of mirror descent
and local saliency anchoring. Overall, UniPruning provides an efficient,
principled, and scalable solution for sparsifying large-scale LLMs. Our code is

*Rana Shahout,Colin Cai,Yilun Du,Minlan Yu,Michael Mitzenmacher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LASER是一种即插即用的推理时路由算法，通过平衡专家负载来提升MoE模型的推理性能，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型通过条件路由减少训练成本，但推理时专家参数和激活会消耗内存，导致专家负载不均衡，影响系统延迟、吞吐量和成本。

Method: LASER根据门函数得分分布自适应路由：当得分偏好明显时路由到最强专家；当得分均匀时扩大可行专家集并路由到负载最轻的专家。无需重新训练或微调。

Result: 在Mixtral-8x7B和DeepSeek-MoE-16b-chat上的评估显示，LASER改善了负载均衡，降低了延迟并提高了吞吐量，同时准确率变化可忽略。

Conclusion: LASER是一种有效的推理时路由算法，能够在不影响准确性的前提下显著提升MoE模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can scale parameter capacity by routing each
token to a subset of experts through a learned gate function. While conditional
routing reduces training costs, it shifts the burden on inference memory:
expert parameters and activations consume memory, limiting the number of
experts per device. As tokens are routed, some experts become overloaded while
others are underutilized. Because experts are mapped to GPUs, this imbalance
translates directly into degraded system performance in terms of latency,
throughput, and cost. We present LASER, a plug-and-play, inference-time routing
algorithm that balances load while preserving accuracy. LASER adapts to the
shape of the gate's score distribution. When scores provide a clear preference,
it routes to the strongest experts; when scores are more uniform, it broadens
the set of viable experts and routes to the least-loaded among them. Because
LASER relies only on gate scores from a trained model, it integrates directly
into existing MoE inference pipelines without retraining or finetuning. We
evaluate LASER on Mixtral-8x7B and DeepSeek-MoE-16b-chat across four datasets
(ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and GSM8K). LASER improves load balancing,
translating into lower latency and higher throughput, while keeping the
accuracy changes negligible.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中设备级资源约束（能量、通信、内存、热预算）的问题，使联邦学习能够在资源受限的边缘设备上实际部署。

Method: 采用拉格朗日对偶优化动态调整训练超参数（冻结深度、本地步数、批量大小、通信压缩），通过梯度积累保持令牌预算来维持训练稳定性。

Result: 在字符级语言模型实验中，相比标准FedAvg，内存使用减少20%，通信减少95%，同时保持竞争力的验证性能。

Conclusion: CAFL-L在满足资源约束方面表现优异，使联邦学习在资源受限的边缘设备上具有实际部署可行性。

Abstract: We introduce Constraint-Aware Federated Learning with Lagrangian Dual
Optimization (CAFL-L), a principled extension of FedAvg that explicitly
incorporates device-level resource constraints including energy, communication,
memory, and thermal budgets. CAFL-L employs Lagrangian dual optimization to
dynamically adapt training hyperparameters -- freezing depth, local steps,
batch size, and communication compression -- while preserving training
stability through token-budget preservation via gradient accumulation.
Experiments on a character-level language model demonstrate that CAFL-L
achieves superior constraint satisfaction compared to standard FedAvg (reducing
memory usage by 20% and communication by 95%) while maintaining competitive
validation performance, making it practical for deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了概念擦除技术只是制造了"遗忘"的假象，实际上是通过偏置采样轨迹来避开目标概念，而非真正删除概念。作者提出了RevAm框架，能够在不修改模型权重的情况下复活被擦除的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型架构演进到Flux等新一代架构，现有的概念擦除方法效果下降，需要揭示其真正机制并区分表面安全与真正概念移除。

Method: 提出RevAm框架，基于强化学习的轨迹优化方法，通过动态引导去噪过程来复活被擦除的概念，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization适应扩散模型。

Result: RevAm实现了优越的概念复活保真度，同时将计算时间减少了10倍，暴露了当前安全机制的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 当前基于轨迹操作的概念擦除技术存在根本性缺陷，需要开发更鲁棒的擦除方法。

Abstract: Concept erasure techniques have been widely deployed in T2I diffusion models
to prevent inappropriate content generation for safety and copyright
considerations. However, as models evolve to next-generation architectures like
Flux, established erasure methods (\textit{e.g.}, ESD, UCE, AC) exhibit
degraded effectiveness, raising questions about their true mechanisms. Through
systematic analysis, we reveal that concept erasure creates only an illusion of
``amnesia": rather than genuine forgetting, these methods bias sampling
trajectories away from target concepts, making the erasure fundamentally
reversible. This insight motivates the need to distinguish superficial safety
from genuine concept removal. In this work, we propose \textbf{RevAm}
(\underline{Rev}oking \underline{Am}nesia), an RL-based trajectory optimization
framework that resurrects erased concepts by dynamically steering the denoising
process without modifying model weights. By adapting Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to diffusion models, RevAm explores diverse recovery
trajectories through trajectory-level rewards, overcoming local optima that
limit existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevAm achieves
superior concept resurrection fidelity while reducing computational time by
10$\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms and
underscoring the need for more robust erasure techniques beyond trajectory
manipulation.

Abstract: Machine learning has been increasingly applied in climate modeling on system

multi-scale coupling, data sparsity, robust generalization, and integration
with scientific workflows. This paper analyzes a series of case studies from

learning. We unpack how these workflows are grounded in physical knowledge,
informed by simulation data, and designed to integrate observations. We aim to
offer a framework for ensuring rigor in scientific machine learning through

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态基础模型需要大量预训练或多模态语料库，计算成本高昂。本文旨在探索是否可以通过轻量级投影头在冻结的单模态编码器上实现化学和文本表示的对齐。

Method: 使用ChEMBL中的配对机制，通过双线性投影将ECFP4分子指纹与生物医学句子嵌入对齐，采用对比学习目标，并引入硬负样本加权和边界损失来处理共享相同治疗靶点的药物。

Result: 在基于支架的分割评估中，该方法实现了非平凡的跨模态对齐，相比冻结基线显著提高了目标内区分能力，能够处理不重叠化学核心的泛化问题。

Conclusion: 薄桥方法为大规模多模态预训练提供了计算效率高的替代方案，支持支架感知的药物-文本对齐和精准医学中的靶点特异性检索。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models hold promise for drug discovery and biomedical
applications, but most existing approaches rely on heavy pretraining or large
scale multimodal corpora. We investigate whether thin contrastive bridges,
lightweight projection heads over frozen unimodal encoders can align chemical
and textual representations without training a full multimodal model. Using
paired mechanisms from ChEMBL, we align ECFP4 molecular fingerprints with
biomedical sentence embeddings through dual linear projections trained with a
contrastive objective. To better handle drugs sharing the same therapeutic
target, we incorporate hard negative weighting and a margin loss. Evaluation
under scaffold based splits, which require generalization across disjoint
chemical cores, demonstrates that our approach achieves non-trivial cross modal
alignment and substantially improves within target discrimination compared to
frozen baselines. These results suggest that thin bridges offer a compute
efficient alternative to large scale multimodal pretraining, enabling scaffold
aware drug text alignment and target specific retrieval in precision medicine.

Result: LLMs复现了大部分假设级效应，捕捉了关键决策偏差，但响应分布与人类数据存在差异，包括强大的商业模型；轻量级干预（思维链提示和超参数调优）减少了不对齐，有时能让较小或开源模型匹配或超越较大系统

Conclusion: LLMs在运营管理中能有效复现人类行为的关键方面，但分布差异仍需关注，轻量级干预可提升模型性能

Abstract: LLMs are emerging tools for simulating human behavior in business, economics,
and social science, offering a lower-cost complement to laboratory experiments,
field studies, and surveys. This paper evaluates how well LLMs replicate human
behavior in operations management. Using nine published experiments in
behavioral operations, we assess two criteria: replication of hypothesis-test
outcomes and distributional alignment via Wasserstein distance. LLMs reproduce
most hypothesis-level effects, capturing key decision biases, but their
response distributions diverge from human data, including for strong commercial
models. We also test two lightweight interventions -- chain-of-thought
prompting and hyperparameter tuning -- which reduce misalignment and can
sometimes let smaller or open-source models match or surpass larger systems.

### [312] [Scaling Laws Revisited: Modeling the Role of Data Quality in Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03313)
*Anirudh Subramanyam,Yuxin Chen,Robert L. Grossman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个包含数据质量参数的扩展缩放定律，将传统的语言模型训练缩放定律从仅考虑模型大小和数据量扩展到同时考虑数据质量维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统缩放定律只关注模型大小和数据量，但忽略了数据质量的重要性。作者希望建立一个能够形式化数据质量对模型性能影响的原理性缩放定律。

Method: 引入无量纲数据质量参数Q，基于有效样本量和信息论视角，提出了质量感知的缩放定律。通过神经机器翻译和自回归建模中的合成实验，系统控制数据质量（噪声注入和覆盖变化）来验证定律。

Result: 实验表明损失随数据质量可预测地缩放，高质量数据可显著减少模型大小和计算需求。发现有效数据随质量呈亚线性衰减，且对适度数据损坏具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了数据质量的显式、可推广的缩放定律，为大规模预训练中数据整理工作和模型规模之间的平衡提供了具体指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws for language model training traditionally characterize how
performance scales with model size and dataset volume. Prior work has explored
architecture variants and data treatments such as dataset filtering and noise
injection in language model pretraining; however, these studies have not
formalized data quality within a principled scaling law. We introduce a
dimensionless data-quality parameter Q, and propose a quality-aware scaling law
extending the Chinchilla framework to predict loss as a joint function of model
size, data volume, and data quality. The law is motivated by an
effective-sample-size and information-theoretic view of noisy or redundant
corpora, and it admits two practical estimators for Q: (i) a corruption rate
proxy and (ii) a deficiency measure. Through synthetic experiments in neural
machine translation and autoregressive modeling -- where we systematically
control data quality via multiple levels of noise injection and coverage
variation -- we show that loss scales predictably with data quality and that
higher-quality data can substantially reduce model size and hence compute
requirements. Our results demonstrate a sublinear decay of effective data with
quality and robustness to moderate data corruption; out-of-sample evaluations
further validate the predictive form of the law. Unlike prior empirical
analyses, our work establishes an explicit, generalizable law for data quality,
offering concrete guidance for balancing data curation effort and model scale
in large-scale pretraining.

TL;DR: 提出基于神经网络的方法，可在约10毫秒内从正弦信号中重建数百赫兹频率，比传统傅里叶方法快得多，精度提高2倍，并实现物理干扰的自动分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环激光陀螺仪等设备需要从正弦信号中快速重建频率，传统方法需要数秒数据，无法满足快速触发需求。

Method: 使用神经网络方法进行频率重建和信号分类，能够快速处理信号并识别物理干扰。

Result: 在10毫秒内重建数百赫兹频率，频率估计精度比标准傅里叶技术提高2倍；物理干扰分类准确率达到99%-100%。

Conclusion: 该方法在信号分析中整合人工智能，为地球物理应用提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The reconstruction of a frequency with minimal delay from a sinusoidal signal
is a common task in several fields; for example Ring Laser Gyroscopes, since
their output signal is a beat frequency. While conventional methods require
several seconds of data, we present a neural network approach capable of
reconstructing frequencies of several hundred Hertz within approximately 10
milliseconds. This enables rapid trigger generation. The method outperforms
standard Fourier-based techniques, improving frequency estimation precision by
a factor of 2 in the operational range of GINGERINO, our Ring Laser
Gyroscope.\\ In addition to fast frequency estimation, we introduce an
automated classification framework to identify physical disturbances in the
signal, such as laser instabilities and seismic events, achieving accuracy
rates between 99\% and 100\% on independent test datasets for the seismic
class. These results mark a step forward in integrating artificial intelligence
into signal analysis for geophysical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习训练过程经常出现严重振荡，导致不稳定和性能下降，需要提高算法稳定性。

Method: CIC框架维护代表性策略和当前策略，仅在当前策略表现更优时选择性更新代表性策略，并采用自适应调整机制让两种策略共同促进critic训练。

Result: 在五个MuJoCo环境上的评估显示，CIC提高了传统算法的性能，且没有产生额外计算成本。

Conclusion: CIC框架能有效增强强化学习算法的稳定性，提升性能，且计算效率高。

Abstract: The training process of reinforcement learning often suffers from severe
oscillations, leading to instability and degraded performance. In this paper,
we propose a Constant in an Ever-Changing World (CIC) framework that enhances
algorithmic stability to improve performance. CIC maintains both a
representative policy and a current policy. Instead of updating the
representative policy blindly, CIC selectively updates it only when the current
policy demonstrates superiority. Furthermore, CIC employs an adaptive
adjustment mechanism, enabling the representative and current policies to
jointly facilitate critic training. We evaluate CIC on five MuJoCo
environments, and the results show that CIC improves the performance of
conventional algorithms without incurring additional computational cost.

TL;DR: SchedMate是一个通过从源代码、运行时日志和历史作业中提取语义信息来增强深度学习调度器的框架，可减少平均作业完成时间达1.91倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习调度器缺乏对作业语义上下文的理解，导致高分析开销、不可靠的持续时间估计、不充分的故障处理和差的可观测性。

Method: 通过三个基于LLM的组件非侵入式地增强现有调度器，从源代码、运行时日志和历史作业等非结构化数据源中提取深度洞察。

Result: 在128-GPU物理集群和生产跟踪的广泛模拟中，SchedMate将平均作业完成时间减少了1.91倍，显著提升了调度性能。

Conclusion: 语义感知在现代深度学习调度中发挥着关键作用，SchedMate通过弥合语义鸿沟有效提升了调度效率。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) schedulers are pivotal in optimizing resource allocation
in GPU clusters, but operate with a critical limitation: they are largely blind
to the semantic context of the jobs they manage. This forces them to rely on
limited metadata, leading to high profiling overhead, unreliable duration
estimation, inadequate failure handling, and poor observability. To this end,
we propose SchedMate, a framework that bridges this semantic gap by
systematically extracting deep insights from overlooked, unstructured data
sources: source code, runtime logs, and historical jobs. SchedMate enhances
existing schedulers non-intrusively through three LLM-based components. Our
implementation integrates seamlessly with existing deep learning schedulers.
Evaluations on a 128-GPU physical cluster and extensive simulations on
production traces show SchedMate reduces average job completion times by up to
1.91x, substantially enhancing the scheduling performance, demonstrating the
critical role of semantic-awareness in modern DL scheduling.

Motivation: 在点云扩散模型训练中，通常使用随机旋转增强数据，并通过Kabsch-Umeyama算法进行旋转对齐来计算损失，但这种对齐步骤的效果尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 将最优去噪器表示为SO(3)上的矩阵Fisher分布，分析对齐对应于采样该分布的模，并推导小噪声水平下的更优近似方法。

Result: 实验表明，对于扩散模型训练中最重要的噪声水平，对齐通常是一个'足够好'的近似方法。

Conclusion: 旋转对齐是扩散模型训练中有效的近似方法，特别是在相关噪声水平下表现良好，同时为小噪声情况提供了更优的近似器。

Abstract: Diffusion models are a popular class of generative models trained to reverse
a noising process starting from a target data distribution. Training a
diffusion model consists of learning how to denoise noisy samples at different
noise levels. When training diffusion models for point clouds such as molecules
and proteins, there is often no canonical orientation that can be assigned. To
capture this symmetry, the true data samples are often augmented by
transforming them with random rotations sampled uniformly over $SO(3)$. Then,
the denoised predictions are often rotationally aligned via the Kabsch-Umeyama
algorithm to the ground truth samples before computing the loss. However, the
effect of this alignment step has not been well studied. Here, we show that the
optimal denoiser can be expressed in terms of a matrix Fisher distribution over
$SO(3)$. Alignment corresponds to sampling the mode of this distribution, and
turns out to be the zeroth order approximation for small noise levels,
explaining its effectiveness. We build on this perspective to derive better
approximators to the optimal denoiser in the limit of small noise. Our
experiments highlight that alignment is often a `good enough' approximation for
the noise levels that matter most for training diffusion models.

Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型已成为序列建模的主流架构，但池化操作作为将token表示聚合为固定大小向量的关键步骤，其作用尚未得到充分研究，尽管它对模型行为有重要影响。

Method: 引入理论框架严格表征配备常用池化方法的Transformer模型的表达能力，推导表示容量和区分相似输入能力的闭式边界，并在计算机视觉、自然语言处理和时间序列分析三个模态上实证评估池化策略。

Result: 研究揭示了池化选择对准确性、敏感性和优化行为的一致影响趋势，为针对特定任务选择或设计池化机制提供了实用指导。

Conclusion: 这项工作将池化定位为Transformer模型中的关键架构组件，为超越注意力机制之外的更原则性模型设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Transformer models have become the dominant backbone for sequence modeling,
leveraging self-attention to produce contextualized token representations.
These are typically aggregated into fixed-size vectors via pooling operations
for downstream tasks. While much of the literature has focused on attention
mechanisms, the role of pooling remains underexplored despite its critical
impact on model behavior. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework
that rigorously characterizes the expressivity of Transformer-based models
equipped with widely used pooling methods by deriving closed-form bounds on
their representational capacity and the ability to distinguish similar inputs.
Our analysis extends to different variations of attention formulations,
demonstrating that these bounds hold across diverse architectural variants. We
empirically evaluate pooling strategies across tasks requiring both global and
local contextual understanding, spanning three major modalities: computer
vision, natural language processing, and time-series analysis. Results reveal
consistent trends in how pooling choices affect accuracy, sensitivity, and
optimization behavior. Our findings unify theoretical and empirical
perspectives, providing practical guidance for selecting or designing pooling
mechanisms suited to specific tasks. This work positions pooling as a key
architectural component in Transformer models and lays the foundation for more
principled model design beyond attention alone.

Motivation: COVID-19疫情凸显了需要在疾病控制和社会经济稳定之间取得平衡的干预策略需求。

Method: 结合多目标强化学习（MORL）和新的随机微分方程（SDE）疫情模拟器，使用Pareto条件网络（PCN）代理进行训练。

Result: 模拟器在重现国家级疫情动态方面比其他RL常用模型精度高数个数量级，能够量化流行病控制与经济稳定之间的权衡，并适用于不同病原体如脊髓灰质炎和流感。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个稳健且适应性强的框架，支持透明、基于证据的公共卫生危机缓解政策制定。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic underscored a critical need for intervention strategies
that balance disease containment with socioeconomic stability. We approach this
challenge by designing a framework for modeling and evaluating disease-spread
prevention strategies. Our framework leverages multi-objective reinforcement
learning (MORL) - a formulation necessitated by competing objectives - combined
with a new stochastic differential equation (SDE) pandemic simulator,
calibrated and validated against global COVID-19 data. Our simulator reproduces
national-scale pandemic dynamics with orders of magnitude higher fidelity than
other models commonly used in reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to
pandemic intervention. Training a Pareto-Conditioned Network (PCN) agent on
this simulator, we illustrate the direct policy trade-offs between
epidemiological control and economic stability for COVID-19. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the framework's generality by extending it to pathogens with
different epidemiological profiles, such as polio and influenza, and show how
these profiles lead the agent to discover fundamentally different intervention
policies. To ground our work in contemporary policymaking challenges, we apply
the model to measles outbreaks, quantifying how a modest 5% drop in vaccination
coverage necessitates significantly more stringent and costly interventions to
curb disease spread. This work provides a robust and adaptable framework to
support transparent, evidence-based policymaking for mitigating public health
crises.

Result: SVM与MIC特征选择方法在所有指标上均获得最高预测性能：准确率0.93、AUC 0.96、F1分数0.93，优于其他四种分类器算法和两种特征选择方法。

Conclusion: SVM+MIC算法优于所有现有的飞行员选拔算法，可能是首个基于眼动追踪和飞行动力学数据的实现，该研究的VR模拟平台和算法可用于飞行员选拔和训练。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the aviation industry, there is a need for a large
number of flight crew. How to select the right pilots in a cost-efficient
manner has become an important research question. In the current study,
twenty-three pilots were recruited from China Eastern Airlines, and 23 novices
were from the community of Tsinghua University. A novel approach incorporating
machine learning and virtual reality technology was applied to distinguish
features between these participants with different flight skills. Results
indicate that SVM with the MIC feature selection method consistently achieved
the highest prediction performance on all metrics with an Accuracy of 0.93, an
AUC of 0.96, and an F1 of 0.93, which outperforms four other classifier
algorithms and two other feature selection methods. From the perspective of
feature selection methods, the MIC method can select features with a nonlinear
relationship to sampling labels, instead of a simple filter-out. Our new
implementation of the SVM + MIC algorithm outperforms all existing pilot
selection algorithms and perhaps provides the first implementation based on eye
tracking and flight dynamics data. This study's VR simulation platforms and
algorithms can be used for pilot selection and training.

Motivation: 现有LLM多智能体系统的通信协议存在自然语言通信的高推理成本和信息丢失问题，或隐藏状态通信的信息集中偏差和低效问题。

Method: 提出KVComm框架，基于注意力重要性得分和高斯先验的KV层级选择策略，识别最具信息量的KV对进行通信。

Result: 在多样化任务和模型对上的实验表明，KVComm仅传输30%层级的KV对就能达到与直接合并输入的无通信上限方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: KV对作为LLM间通信的有效媒介具有巨大潜力，为可扩展和高效的多智能体系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent
systems, where effective inter-model communication is crucial. Existing
communication protocols either rely on natural language, incurring high
inference costs and information loss, or on hidden states, which suffer from
information concentration bias and inefficiency. To address these limitations,
we propose KVComm, a novel communication framework that enables efficient
communication between LLMs through selective sharing of KV pairs. KVComm
leverages the rich information encoded in the KV pairs while avoiding the
pitfalls of hidden states. We introduce a KV layer-wise selection strategy
based on attention importance scores with a Gaussian prior to identify the most
informative KV pairs for communication. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks and model pairs demonstrate that KVComm achieves comparable performance
to the upper-bound method, which directly merges inputs to one model without
any communication, while transmitting as few as 30\% of layers' KV pairs. Our
study highlights the potential of KV pairs as an effective medium for inter-LLM
communication, paving the way for scalable and efficient multi-agent systems.

Result: 人类专家显著优于最先进模型，模型倾向于产生幻觉和过度预测风险强度，在复杂动态系统中表现出较差的时空推理能力。

Conclusion: AgentCaster旨在推进LLM智能体在关键领域挑战性推理任务中的改进研究。

Abstract: There is a growing need to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex,
high-impact, real-world tasks to assess their true readiness as reasoning
agents. To address this gap, we introduce AgentCaster, a contamination-free
framework employing multimodal LLMs end-to-end for the challenging,
long-horizon task of tornado forecasting. Within AgentCaster, models interpret
heterogeneous spatiotemporal data from a high-resolution convection-allowing
forecast archive. We assess model performance over a 40-day period featuring
diverse historical data, spanning several major tornado outbreaks and including
over 500 tornado reports. Each day, models query interactively from a pool of
3,625 forecast maps and 40,125 forecast soundings for a forecast horizon of
12-36 hours. Probabilistic tornado-risk polygon predictions are verified
against ground truths derived from geometric comparisons across disjoint risk
bands in projected coordinate space. To quantify accuracy, we propose
domain-specific TornadoBench and TornadoHallucination metrics, with
TornadoBench highly challenging for both LLMs and domain expert human
forecasters. Notably, human experts significantly outperform state-of-the-art
models, which demonstrate a strong tendency to hallucinate and overpredict risk
intensity, struggle with precise geographic placement, and exhibit poor
spatiotemporal reasoning in complex, dynamically evolving systems. AgentCaster
aims to advance research on improving LLM agents for challenging reasoning
tasks in critical domains.

Abstract: Nearly one in five adolescents currently live with a diagnosed mental or
behavioral health condition, such as anxiety, depression, or conduct disorder,
underscoring the urgency of developing accurate and interpretable diagnostic
tools. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a
powerful lens into large-scale functional connectivity, where brain regions are
modeled as nodes and inter-regional synchrony as edges, offering clinically
relevant biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. While prior works use graph
neural network (GNN) approaches for disorder prediction, they remain complex
black-boxes, limiting their reliability and clinical translation. In this work,
we propose CONCEPTNEURO, a concept-based diagnosis framework that leverages
large language models (LLMs) and neurobiological domain knowledge to
automatically generate, filter, and encode interpretable functional
connectivity concepts. Each concept is represented as a structured subgraph
linking specific brain regions, which are then passed through a concept
classifier. Our design ensures predictions through clinically meaningful
connectivity patterns, enabling both interpretability and strong predictive
performance. Extensive experiments across multiple psychiatric disorder
datasets demonstrate that CONCEPTNEURO-augmented GNNs consistently outperform
their vanilla counterparts, improving accuracy while providing transparent,
clinically aligned explanations. Furthermore, concept analyses highlight
disorder-specific connectivity patterns that align with expert knowledge and
suggest new hypotheses for future investigation, establishing CONCEPTNEURO as
an interpretable, domain-informed framework for psychiatric disorder diagnosis.

Abstract: Aluminum is a widely used alloy, which is susceptible to fatigue failure.
Characterizing fatigue performance for materials is extremely time and cost
demanding, especially for high cycle data. To help mitigate this, a transfer
learning based framework has been developed using Long short-term memory
networks (LSTMs) in which a source LSTM model is trained based on pure axial
fatigue data for Aluminum 7075-T6 alloy which is then transferred to predict
high cycle torsional S-N curves. The framework was able to accurately predict
Al torsional S-N curves for a much higher cycle range. It is the belief that
this framework will help to drastically mitigate the cost of gathering fatigue
characteristics for different materials and help prioritize tests with better
cost and time constraints.

Abstract: Transformers are widely used across data modalities, and yet the principles
distilled from text models often transfer imperfectly to models trained to
other modalities. In this paper, we analyze Transformers through the lens of
rank structure. Our focus is on the time series setting, where the structural
properties of the data differ remarkably from those of text or vision. We show
that time-series embeddings, unlike text or vision, exhibit sharply decaying
singular value spectra: small patch sizes and smooth continuous mappings
concentrate the data into low-rank subspaces. From this, we prove that the
associated $Q/K/V$ projections admit accurate low-rank approximations, and that
attention layers become compressible in proportion to the decay of the
embedding spectrum. We introduce the concept of flow-of-ranks, a phenomenon by
which nonlinear mixing across depth inflates the rank, explaining why early
layers are most amenable to compression and why ranks grow with depth. Guided
by these theoretical and empirical results, we use these insights to compress
Chronos, a large time series foundation model, achieving a reduction of $65\%$
in inference time and $81\%$ in memory, without loss of accuracy. Our findings
provide principled guidance for allocating width, depth, and heads in time
series foundation models, and for exploiting their inherent compressibility.

for turbulence control are learned jointly using Physics Informed Neural
Operators (PINO), which are discretization invariant and can capture fine
scales in turbulent flows accurately. Our PINO-PC outperforms prior model-free
reinforcement learning methods in various challenging scenarios where the flows
are of high Reynolds numbers and unseen, i.e., not provided during model
training. We find that PINO-PC achieves a drag reduction of 39.0\% under a
bulk-velocity Reynolds number of 15,000, outperforming previous fluid control
methods by more than 32\%.

TL;DR: 提出一个整合开源数据的框架，使用神经网络预测车辆运行模式分布，显著降低交通排放估算误差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用开源数据为城市区域车辆活动和排放估算提供可扩展且透明的基础

Method: 整合MOVES和开源GPS轨迹数据、OpenStreetMap道路网络、区域交通数据集和卫星影像特征向量，训练神经网络模型预测MOVES定义的运行模式分布

Result: 与MOVES基线相比，对CO、NOx、CO2和PM2.5等关键污染物的区域尺度交通排放，RMSE降低了50%以上

Conclusion: 证明了使用完全开源数据源进行低成本、可复制和数据驱动的排放估算的可行性

Abstract: Open-source data offers a scalable and transparent foundation for estimating
vehicle activity and emissions in urban regions. In this study, we propose a
data-driven framework that integrates MOVES and open-source GPS trajectory
data, OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks, regional traffic datasets and
satellite imagery-derived feature vectors to estimate the link level operating
mode distribution and traffic emissions. A neural network model is trained to
predict the distribution of MOVES-defined operating modes using only features
derived from readily available data. The proposed methodology was applied using
open-source data related to 45 municipalities in the Boston Metropolitan area.
The "ground truth" operating mode distribution was established using OSM
open-source GPS trajectories. Compared to the MOVES baseline, the proposed
model reduces RMSE by over 50% for regional scale traffic emissions of key
pollutants including CO, NOx, CO2, and PM2.5. This study demonstrates the
feasibility of low-cost, replicable, and data-driven emissions estimation using
fully open data sources.

TL;DR: WindSR是一种用于轮毂高度风速超分辨率降尺度的扩散模型，通过数据同化将稀疏观测数据与模拟场结合，提高了风速预测的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的轮毂高度风观测数据在空间和时间上都很稀疏，而模拟数据虽然广泛可用但存在偏差且分辨率不足，无法满足风电场选址或极端天气风险评估的需求。

Method: 开发了WindSR扩散模型，采用动态半径融合方法将观测数据与模拟场结合，在训练和推理过程中融入地形信息，并使用先进的扩散模型进行超分辨率降尺度。

Result: 与卷积神经网络和生成对抗网络基线相比，WindSR在降尺度效率和准确性方面表现更优，数据同化使模型偏差相对于独立观测减少了约20%。

Conclusion: WindSR通过整合观测和模拟数据，成功生成了高质量、高分辨率的轮毂高度风速，为风能应用提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: High-quality observations of hub-height winds are valuable but sparse in
space and time. Simulations are widely available on regular grids but are
generally biased and too coarse to inform wind-farm siting or to assess
extreme-weather-related risks (e.g., gusts) at infrastructure scales. To fully
utilize both data types for generating high-quality, high-resolution hub-height
wind speeds (tens to ~100m above ground), this study introduces WindSR, a
diffusion model with data assimilation for super-resolution downscaling of
hub-height winds. WindSR integrates sparse observational data with simulation
fields during downscaling using state-of-the-art diffusion models. A
dynamic-radius blending method is introduced to merge observations with
simulations, providing conditioning for the diffusion process. Terrain
information is incorporated during both training and inference to account for
its role as a key driver of winds. Evaluated against
convolutional-neural-network and generative-adversarial-network baselines,
WindSR outperforms them in both downscaling efficiency and accuracy. Our data
assimilation reduces WindSR's model bias by approximately 20% relative to
independent observations.

TL;DR: 本文通过机制可解释性方法，首次提供了因果证据表明Transformer模型中的回忆和推理能力依赖于可分离但相互作用的电路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分回忆和推理能力对于预测模型泛化、设计针对性评估以及构建只影响一种能力而不干扰另一种能力的安全干预措施至关重要。

Method: 使用机制可解释性方法，通过受控的合成语言谜题数据集，在层、头和神经元级别探测Transformer模型。结合激活修补和结构化消融来因果测量组件对每种任务类型的贡献。

Result: 在两个模型家族（Qwen和LLaMA）中，发现对特定层和注意力头的干预会导致选择性损伤：禁用识别的"回忆电路"使事实检索准确率降低高达15%而推理保持完整，禁用"推理电路"使多步推理降低类似幅度。

Conclusion: 研究结果推进了机制可解释性，将电路级结构与功能专业化联系起来，展示了受控数据集和因果干预如何提供对模型认知的机制性见解，为大型语言模型的安全部署提供信息。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel at both recall (retrieving memorized
facts) and reasoning (performing multi-step inference), but whether these
abilities rely on distinct internal mechanisms remains unclear. Distinguishing
recall from reasoning is crucial for predicting model generalization, designing
targeted evaluations, and building safer interventions that affect one ability
without disrupting the other.We approach this question through mechanistic
interpretability, using controlled datasets of synthetic linguistic puzzles to
probe transformer models at the layer, head, and neuron level. Our pipeline
combines activation patching and structured ablations to causally measure
component contributions to each task type. Across two model families (Qwen and
LLaMA), we find that interventions on distinct layers and attention heads lead
to selective impairments: disabling identified "recall circuits" reduces
fact-retrieval accuracy by up to 15\% while leaving reasoning intact, whereas
disabling "reasoning circuits" reduces multi-step inference by a comparable
margin. At the neuron level, we observe task-specific firing patterns, though
these effects are less robust, consistent with neuronal polysemanticity.Our
results provide the first causal evidence that recall and reasoning rely on
separable but interacting circuits in transformer models. These findings
advance mechanistic interpretability by linking circuit-level structure to
functional specialization and demonstrate how controlled datasets and causal
interventions can yield mechanistic insights into model cognition, informing
safer deployment of large language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合低频同步和梯度动量压缩的方法，通过离散余弦变换将Nesterov动量分解为高低频分量，仅同步高频分量，大幅减少分布式训练中的通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对高带宽互联的依赖，使分布式计算资源能够替代集中式数据中心训练大型模型。

Method: 将优化器动量视为信号，通过离散余弦变换分解Nesterov动量为高低频分量，每H步仅同步高频分量，结合低频同步和梯度动量压缩。

Result: 相比基线DiLoCo实现了16倍的通信减少，在基于transformer的语言模型和卷积神经网络上均表现出良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了在低带宽互联的分布式节点上训练大型模型的可行性。

Abstract: The training of large models demands substantial computational resources,
typically available only in data centers with high-bandwidth interconnects.
However, reducing the reliance on high-bandwidth interconnects between nodes
enables the use of distributed compute resources as an alternative to
centralized data center training. Building on recent advances in distributed
model training, we propose an approach that further reduces communication by
combining infrequent synchronizations across distributed model replicas with
gradient momentum compression. In particular, we treat the optimizer momentum
as a signal and decompose the Nesterov momentum into high- and low-frequency
components via the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Only the high-frequency
components are synchronized across model replicas every $H$ steps. Empirically,
our method achieves up to a $16\times$ reduction in communication compared to
the baseline DiLoCo, and it generalizes across architectures, including
transformer-based language models and convolutional neural networks for images.
Overall, this work advances the feasibility of training large models on
distributed nodes with low-bandwidth interconnects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据自由知识蒸馏方法存在三个问题：缺乏伪监督学习范式、无法区分不同类别样本分布、无法优化类别多样性样本，限制了学生模型的性能提升。

Method: 使用条件生成对抗网络合成类别特定的多样化图像；改进生成器模块以区分不同类别分布；提出基于教师和学生视图的伪监督对比学习来增强多样性。

Result: 在三个常用数据集上的综合实验验证了CPSC-DFKD对学生模型和生成器性能的提升。

Conclusion: CPSC-DFKD通过条件伪监督对比学习有效解决了当前数据自由知识蒸馏方法的局限性，显著提升了学生模型的性能。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation~(DFKD) is an effective manner to solve model
compression and transmission restrictions while retaining privacy protection,
which has attracted extensive attention in recent years. Currently, the
majority of existing methods utilize a generator to synthesize images to
support the distillation. Although the current methods have achieved great
success, there are still many issues to be explored. Firstly, the outstanding
performance of supervised learning in deep learning drives us to explore a
pseudo-supervised paradigm on DFKD. Secondly, current synthesized methods
cannot distinguish the distributions of different categories of samples, thus
producing ambiguous samples that may lead to an incorrect evaluation by the
teacher. Besides, current methods cannot optimize the category-wise diversity
samples, which will hinder the student model learning from diverse samples and
further achieving better performance. In this paper, to address the above
limitations, we propose a novel learning paradigm, i.e., conditional
pseudo-supervised contrast for data-free knowledge distillation~(CPSC-DFKD).
The primary innovations of CPSC-DFKD are: (1) introducing a conditional
generative adversarial network to synthesize category-specific diverse images
for pseudo-supervised learning, (2) improving the modules of the generator to
distinguish the distributions of different categories, and (3) proposing
pseudo-supervised contrastive learning based on teacher and student views to
enhance diversity. Comprehensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets
validate the performance lift of both the student and generator brought by
CPSC-DFKD. The code is available at https://github.com/RoryShao/CPSC-DFKD.git

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文评估了现有聚类联邦学习算法在数量倾斜问题下的表现，并提出了一种新的迭代算法CORNFLQS，该算法在准确性和聚类质量方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的非独立同分布数据问题，特别是数量倾斜问题，严重影响了模型性能。现有的聚类联邦学习方法缺乏对数量倾斜问题的系统评估，且面临显著挑战。

Method: 提出了CORNFLQS算法，通过优化协调CFL的两种操作策略（客户端选择最小化本地训练损失的集群，以及服务器基于本地模型相似性分组客户端），实现了对数量倾斜问题的鲁棒性。

Result: 在6个图像分类数据集上的270个非独立同分布配置实验中，CORNFLQS在准确性和聚类质量方面均获得最高平均排名，对数量倾斜扰动表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CORNFLQS算法优于现有的CFL算法，为处理联邦学习中的数量倾斜问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized paradigm that enables a
client-server architecture to collaboratively train a global Artificial
Intelligence model without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy. A key
challenge in FL is Non-IID data. Quantity Skew (QS) is a particular problem of
Non-IID, where clients hold highly heterogeneous data volumes. Clustered
Federated Learning (CFL) is an emergent variant of FL that presents a promising
solution to Non-IID problem. It improves models' performance by grouping
clients with similar data distributions into clusters. CFL methods generally
fall into two operating strategies. In the first strategy, clients select the
cluster that minimizes the local training loss. In the second strategy, the
server groups clients based on local model similarities. However, most CFL
methods lack systematic evaluation under QS but present significant challenges
because of it. In this paper, we present two main contributions. The first one
is an evaluation of state-of-the-art CFL algorithms under various Non-IID
settings, applying multiple QS scenarios to assess their robustness. Our second
contribution is a novel iterative CFL algorithm, named CORNFLQS, which proposes
an optimal coordination between both operating strategies of CFL. Our approach
is robust against the different variations of QS settings. We conducted
intensive experiments on six image classification datasets, resulting in 270
Non-IID configurations. The results show that CORNFLQS achieves the highest
average ranking in both accuracy and clustering quality, as well as strong
robustness to QS perturbations. Overall, our approach outperforms actual CFL
algorithms.

TL;DR: 提出STDAE框架，通过两阶段跨模态重建预训练，从主线数据重建历史匝道流量，解决匝道检测器缺乏导致的交通预测盲点问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速公路匝道缺乏实时检测器，导致交通预测存在盲点，需要从主线数据推断匝道流量。

Method: 采用解耦的时空自动编码器架构，第一阶段重建历史匝道流量，第二阶段将学习到的表示与GWNet等模型集成进行预测。

Result: 在三个真实世界匝道数据集上的实验表明，STDAE-GWNet持续优于13个最先进基线，性能接近使用历史匝道数据的模型。

Conclusion: STDAE能有效克服检测器稀缺问题，具有即插即用潜力，可应用于多种预测流程。

Abstract: Interchanges are crucial nodes for vehicle transfers between highways, yet
the lack of real-time ramp detectors creates blind spots in traffic prediction.
To address this, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Decoupled Autoencoder (STDAE), a
two-stage framework that leverages cross-modal reconstruction pretraining. In
the first stage, STDAE reconstructs historical ramp flows from mainline data,
forcing the model to capture intrinsic spatio-temporal relations. Its decoupled
architecture with parallel spatial and temporal autoencoders efficiently
extracts heterogeneous features. In the prediction stage, the learned
representations are integrated with models such as GWNet to enhance accuracy.
Experiments on three real-world interchange datasets show that STDAE-GWNET
consistently outperforms thirteen state-of-the-art baselines and achieves
performance comparable to models using historical ramp data. This demonstrates
its effectiveness in overcoming detector scarcity and its plug-and-play
potential for diverse forecasting pipelines.

Motivation: 随着物理信息损失函数的流行，需要评估损失函数在训练网络以强制执行特定边界条件时的可靠性。报告模型变异对于评估损失函数的一致性训练能力以及在不同方法间进行公平比较至关重要。

Method: 使用Pix2Pix网络预测高弹性对比复合材料的应力场作为案例研究，实现了多种强制执行应力平衡的不同损失函数，并在多次训练会话中评估它们的表现。

Result: 不同的损失函数在收敛性、准确性和应力平衡执行方面显示出不同程度的变异。某些损失函数在多次训练中表现更一致，而其他函数则显示出较大的变异性。

Conclusion: 报告模型变异对于评估训练算法的可靠性和可重复性至关重要。建议在研究中报告模型变异，以便更公平地比较不同方法，并提高深度学习训练过程的透明度。

Abstract: A successful deep learning network is highly dependent not only on the
training dataset, but the training algorithm used to condition the network for
a given task. The loss function, dataset, and tuning of hyperparameters all
play an essential role in training a network, yet there is not much discussion
on the reliability or reproducibility of a training algorithm. With the rise in
popularity of physics-informed loss functions, this raises the question of how
reliable one's loss function is in conditioning a network to enforce a
particular boundary condition. Reporting the model variation is needed to
assess a loss function's ability to consistently train a network to obey a
given boundary condition, and provides a fairer comparison among different
methods. In this work, a Pix2Pix network predicting the stress fields of high
elastic contrast composites is used as a case study. Several different loss
functions enforcing stress equilibrium are implemented, with each displaying
different levels of variation in convergence, accuracy, and enforcing stress
equilibrium across many training sessions. Suggested practices in reporting
model variation are also shared.

Result: MT-NDP在点精度和校准方面优于单任务NDP和GP，特别对于偏离机群平均行为的风机表现更佳，提供更尖锐但可信的预测区间。

Conclusion: 基于NDP的模型提供校准且可扩展的预测，适合运行部署，可为现代风电场的调度和维护决策提供支持。

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware wind power prediction is essential for grid integration and
reliable wind farm operation. We apply neural diffusion processes (NDPs)-a
recent class of models that learn distributions over functions-and extend them
to a multi-task NDP (MT-NDP) framework for wind power prediction. We provide
the first empirical evaluation of NDPs in real supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) data. We introduce a task encoder within MT-NDPs to capture
cross-turbine correlations and enable few-shot adaptation to unseen turbines.
The proposed MT-NDP framework outperforms single-task NDPs and GPs in terms of
point accuracy and calibration, particularly for wind turbines whose behaviour
deviates from the fleet average. In general, NDP-based models deliver
calibrated and scalable predictions suitable for operational deployment,
offering sharper, yet trustworthy, predictive intervals that can support
dispatch and maintenance decisions in modern wind farms.

Motivation: 在移动设备上微调大型语言模型时，传统的反向传播方法内存消耗大，而零阶优化方法虽然内存占用小但收敛速度慢，需要更好的解决方案。

Method: 开发了内存高效的反向传播实现(MeBP)，通过优化内存管理来减少内存占用，同时保持反向传播的计算效率。

Result: 在iPhone 15 Pro Max上验证，各种0.5B到4B参数的LLM可以使用少于1GB内存进行微调，比零阶优化收敛更快且性能更好。

Conclusion: MeBP为移动设备上的LLM微调提供了实用的解决方案，在内存使用和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with backpropagation\textemdash even
for a subset of parameters such as LoRA\textemdash can be much more
memory-consuming than inference and is often deemed impractical for
resource-constrained mobile devices. Alternative methods, such as zeroth-order
optimization (ZO), can greatly reduce the memory footprint but come at the cost
of significantly slower model convergence (10$\times$ to 100$\times$ more steps
than backpropagation). We propose a memory-efficient implementation of
backpropagation (MeBP) on mobile devices that provides better trade-off between
memory usage and compute time, while converging faster and achieving better
performance than the ZO baseline. We verify the effectiveness of MeBP on an
iPhone 15 Pro Max and show that various LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 4B
parameters, can be fine-tuned using less than 1GB of memory. We release an
example of the MeBP implementation at https://github.com/apple/ml-mebp.

Motivation: 深度学习、金融等领域需要在长序列上对实数进行复合计算，常导致灾难性的数值下溢或上溢问题，需要一种能够处理更大动态范围数值的稳定计算方法。

Method: 引入广义数量级(GOOMs)概念，结合高效的并行前缀扫描算法，在并行硬件上实现原生执行。

Result: 在三个代表性实验中表现出色：超越标准浮点数限制的实数矩阵乘积复合计算；并行估计Lyapunov指数谱，比先前方法快几个数量级；在深度循环神经网络中捕获长程依赖关系而无需任何稳定化处理。

Conclusion: GOOMs结合高效并行扫描为高动态范围应用提供了可扩展且数值稳健的替代方案，使之前被认为不切实际或不可能的计算变得可行和实用。

Abstract: Many domains, from deep learning to finance, require compounding real numbers
over long sequences, often leading to catastrophic numerical underflow or
overflow. We introduce generalized orders of magnitude (GOOMs), a principled
extension of traditional orders of magnitude that incorporates floating-point
numbers as a special case, and which in practice enables stable computation
over significantly larger dynamic ranges of real numbers than previously
possible. We implement GOOMs, along with an efficient custom parallel prefix
scan, to support native execution on parallel hardware such as GPUs. We
demonstrate that our implementation of GOOMs outperforms traditional approaches
with three representative experiments, all of which were previously considered
impractical or impossible, and now become possible and practical: (1)
compounding real matrix products far beyond standard floating-point limits; (2)
estimating spectra of Lyapunov exponents in parallel, orders of magnitude
faster than with previous methods, applying a novel selective-resetting method
to prevent state colinearity; and (3) capturing long-range dependencies in deep
recurrent neural networks with non-diagonal recurrent states, computed in
parallel via a prefix scan, without requiring any form of stabilization. Our
results show that our implementation of GOOMs, combined with efficient parallel
scanning, offers a scalable and numerically robust alternative to conventional
floating-point numbers for high-dynamic-range applications.

Abstract: Learning from large heterogeneous graphs presents significant challenges due
to the scale of networks, heterogeneity in node and edge types, variations in
nodal features, and complex local neighborhood structures. This paper advocates
for ensemble learning as a natural solution to this problem, whereby training
multiple graph learners under distinct sampling conditions, the ensemble
inherently captures different aspects of graph heterogeneity. Yet, the crux
lies in combining these learners to meet global optimization objective while
maintaining computational efficiency on large-scale graphs. In response, we
propose LHGEL, an ensemble framework that addresses these challenges through
batch sampling with three key components, namely batch view aggregation,
residual attention, and diversity regularization. Specifically, batch view
aggregation samples subgraphs and forms multiple graph views, while residual
attention adaptively weights the contributions of these views to guide node
embeddings toward informative subgraphs, thereby improving the accuracy of base
learners. Diversity regularization encourages representational disparity across
embedding matrices derived from different views, promoting model diversity and
ensemble robustness. Our theoretical study demonstrates that residual attention
mitigates gradient vanishing issues commonly faced in ensemble learning.
Empirical results on five real heterogeneous networks validate that our LHGEL
approach consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors by
substantial margin. Codes and datasets are available at

Conclusion: 核变点检测不仅具有理论可靠性，在实际文本分割任务中也表现出色，特别是在Taylor Swift推文案例中展示了实用价值。

Abstract: Kernel change-point detection (KCPD) has become a widely used tool for
identifying structural changes in complex data. While existing theory
establishes consistency under independence assumptions, real-world sequential
data such as text exhibits strong dependencies. We establish new guarantees for
KCPD under $m$-dependent data: specifically, we prove consistency in the number
of detected change points and weak consistency in their locations under mild
additional assumptions. We perform an LLM-based simulation that generates
synthetic $m$-dependent text to validate the asymptotics. To complement these
results, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of KCPD for text
segmentation with modern embeddings. Across diverse text datasets, KCPD with
text embeddings outperforms baselines in standard text segmentation metrics. We
demonstrate through a case study on Taylor Swift's tweets that KCPD not only
provides strong theoretical and simulated reliability but also practical
effectiveness for text segmentation tasks.

Motivation: 人类是黑盒子，但社会通过评估可验证的论证来运作。AI可解释性应遵循这一原则：利益相关者需要可验证的推理链，而非机制透明度。

Method: 使用结构化论证方法，将LLM文本转换为论证图，采用双极假设论证捕获支持/攻击关系，实现自动幻觉检测。在多智能体风险评估中使用结构化假设技术。

Result: 在AAEC数据集上达到94.44宏F1值（比先前工作高5.7点），在Argumentative MicroTexts关系分类上达到0.81宏F1值（比先前结果高约0.07）。

Conclusion: 结构化论证方法为AI系统提供了可验证的解释能力，超越了传统可解释性和LLM生成解释的能力，支持无需重新训练的迭代精炼验证机制。

Abstract: Humans are black boxes -- we cannot observe their neural processes, yet
society functions by evaluating verifiable arguments. AI explainability should
follow this principle: stakeholders need verifiable reasoning chains, not
mechanistic transparency. We propose using structured argumentation to provide
a level of explanation and verification neither interpretability nor
LLM-generated explanation is able to offer. Our pipeline achieves
state-of-the-art 94.44 macro F1 on the AAEC published train/test split (5.7
points above prior work) and $0.81$ macro F1, $\sim$0.07 above previous
published results with comparable data setups, for Argumentative MicroTexts
relation classification, converting LLM text into argument graphs and enabling
verification at each inferential step. We demonstrate this idea on multi-agent
risk assessment using the Structured What-If Technique, where specialized
agents collaborate transparently to carry out risk assessment otherwise
achieved by humans alone. Using Bipolar Assumption-Based Argumentation, we
capture support/attack relationships, thereby enabling automatic hallucination
detection via fact nodes attacking arguments. We also provide a verification
mechanism that enables iterative refinement through test-time feedback without
retraining. For easy deployment, we provide a Docker container for the
fine-tuned AMT model, and the rest of the code with the Bipolar ABA Python
package on GitHub.

*Benoit Dherin,Michael Munn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了残差扩展定理，证明了深度残差网络在数学上等价于浅层模型的隐式集成，并解释了归一化层在训练深度模型中的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解为什么深度残差架构（如ResNet和Transformer）如此有效，以及为什么需要归一化层来训练深度模型。

Method: 通过残差扩展定理进行理论分析，推导出深度残差网络的显式解析公式，揭示其隐式集成结构。

Result: 发现增加网络深度在数学上等同于扩展隐式集成的大小，并揭示了组合计算路径导致输出信号爆炸的现象。

Conclusion: 残差模块的缩放提供了控制组合爆炸的原则性解决方案，同时也隐式正则化模型复杂度，为归一化层的作用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Deep residual architectures, such as ResNet and the Transformer, have enabled
models of unprecedented depth, yet a formal understanding of why depth is so
effective remains an open question. A popular intuition, following Veit et al.
(2016), is that these residual networks behave like ensembles of many shallower
models. Our key finding is an explicit analytical formula that verifies this
ensemble perspective, proving that increasing network depth is mathematically
equivalent to expanding the size of this implicit ensemble. Furthermore, our
expansion reveals a hierarchical ensemble structure in which the combinatorial
growth of computation paths leads to an explosion in the output signal,
explaining the historical necessity of normalization layers in training deep
models. This insight offers a first principles explanation for the historical
dependence on normalization layers and sheds new light on a family of
successful normalization-free techniques like SkipInit and Fixup. However,
while these previous approaches infer scaling factors through optimizer
analysis or a heuristic analogy to Batch Normalization, our work offers the
first explanation derived directly from the network's inherent functional
structure. Specifically, our Residual Expansion Theorem reveals that scaling
each residual module provides a principled solution to taming the combinatorial
explosion inherent to these architectures. We further show that this scaling
acts as a capacity controls that also implicitly regularizes the model's
complexity.

*Quan Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对Adam优化器中动量参数β₁和β₂的理论分析进行了扩展，提出了适用于β₁≥√β₂和β₁≤√β₂的更通用分析框架，证明了现有界限的严格推广，并揭示了参数设置对对抗性环境的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam优化器虽然在实际应用中非常有效，但其动量参数β₁和β₂的最优设置理论理解仍不完整。现有分析要求β₁=√β₂，无法覆盖更实际的β₁≠√β₂情况，因此需要更通用的理论分析。

Method: 通过将Adam视为Follow-the-Regularized-Leader(FTRL)算法的实例，推导出适用于β₁≥√β₂和β₁≤√β₂两种情况的新的、更通用的分析框架。

Result: 新分析框架严格推广了现有界限，在最坏情况下证明界限是紧的，并发现β₁=√β₂对于非对抗性环境是最优的，但对于对抗性环境则是次优的。

Conclusion: 本文提供了对Adam优化器动量参数更全面的理论理解，揭示了参数最优设置依赖于环境对抗性，为实际应用中的参数调优提供了理论指导。

Abstract: While Adam is one of the most effective optimizer for training large-scale
machine learning models, a theoretical understanding of how to optimally set
its momentum factors, $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$, remains largely incomplete.
  Prior works have shown that Adam can be seen as an instance of
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL), one of the most important class of
algorithms in online learning.
  The prior analyses in these works required setting $\beta_1 =
\sqrt{\beta_2}$, which does not cover the more practical cases with $\beta_1
\neq \sqrt{\beta_2}$.
  We derive novel, more general analyses that hold for both $\beta_1 \geq
\sqrt{\beta_2}$ and $\beta_1 \leq \sqrt{\beta_2}$.
  In both cases, our results strictly generalize the existing bounds.
  Furthermore, we show that our bounds are tight in the worst case.
  We also prove that setting $\beta_1 = \sqrt{\beta_2}$ is optimal for an
oblivious adversary, but sub-optimal for an non-oblivious adversary.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的异常检测框架RADF，解决大规模分布式系统中异常检测面临的三大挑战：数据量大、数据集异构性和根因分析困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模分布式系统中异常检测面临的三大挑战：1) 海量数据处理 2) 异构时间序列数据集的多样性 3) 异常根因分析的困难性。

Method: 开发了RADF框架，采用mSelect技术自动选择算法和调参，并包含后检测能力以加速故障定位和根因分析。

Result: 在9个公共基准数据集中，RADF在5个数据集上的AUC性能超越了最先进的异常检测模型，其中7个数据集的AUC超过0.85。

Conclusion: RADF框架通过自动化算法选择和参数调优，在大规模异常检测任务中表现出色，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in large, distributed systems presents several
challenges. The first challenge arises from the sheer volume of data that needs
to be processed. Flagging anomalies in a high-throughput environment calls for
a careful consideration of both algorithm and system design. The second
challenge comes from the heterogeneity of time-series datasets that leverage
such a system in production. In practice, anomaly detection systems are rarely
deployed for a single use case. Typically, there are several metrics to
monitor, often across several domains (e.g. engineering, business and
operations). A one-size-fits-all approach rarely works, so these systems need
to be fine-tuned for every application - this is often done manually. The third
challenge comes from the fact that determining the root-cause of anomalies in
such settings is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Identifying (in real
time) a time-series dataset that is associated causally with the anomalous
time-series data is a very difficult problem. In this paper, we describe a
unified framework that addresses these challenges. Reasoning based Anomaly
Detection Framework (RADF) is designed to perform real time anomaly detection
on very large datasets. This framework employs a novel technique (mSelect) that
automates the process of algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning for
each use case. Finally, it incorporates a post-detection capability that allows
for faster triaging and root-cause determination. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that RADF, powered by mSelect, surpasses state-of-the-art anomaly
detection models in AUC performance for 5 out of 9 public benchmarking
datasets. RADF achieved an AUC of over 0.85 for 7 out of 9 datasets, a
distinction unmatched by any other state-of-the-art model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了有限时域离线强化学习中的策略评估和策略优化问题，在轨迹数据和qπ可实现的假设下，提出了统计高效的策略评估学习器，并改进了现有策略优化方法的样本复杂度分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明，在仅有数据覆盖性和qπ可实现性假设下，策略评估和策略优化都无法实现统计高效学习。最近有工作证明了在轨迹数据假设下策略优化的可行性，但策略评估问题仍未解决。

Method: 在轨迹数据和qπ可实现性假设下，提出了统计高效的策略评估学习器，并对现有策略优化方法进行了更严格的样本复杂度分析。

Result: 成功开发了统计高效的策略评估学习器，并显著改进了策略优化方法的样本复杂度上界。

Conclusion: 在轨迹数据和qπ可实现性假设下，离线强化学习中的策略评估和策略优化都可以实现统计高效学习，且策略优化的样本复杂度可以得到进一步优化。

Abstract: We study finite-horizon offline reinforcement learning (RL) with function
approximation for both policy evaluation and policy optimization. Prior work
established that statistically efficient learning is impossible for either of
these problems when the only assumptions are that the data has good coverage
(concentrability) and the state-action value function of every policy is
linearly realizable ($q^\pi$-realizability) (Foster et al., 2021). Recently,
Tkachuk et al. (2024) gave a statistically efficient learner for policy
optimization, if in addition the data is assumed to be given as trajectories.
In this work we present a statistically efficient learner for policy evaluation
under the same assumptions. Further, we show that the sample complexity of the
learner used by Tkachuk et al. (2024) for policy optimization can be improved
by a tighter analysis.

Motivation: 解决传统策略梯度方法方差高和通过时间反向传播复杂的问题，提供更稳定的学习过程。

Method: 使用扩散策略，结合分布评论家（融合分布RL和裁剪双Q学习）和避免高方差的策略改进目标。

Result: 在Humanoid、Dog、Shadow Hand等18个困难RL任务中达到最先进性能，包括密集奖励和目标条件RL场景。

Conclusion: D2AC算法在复杂RL任务中表现出色，具有行为鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce D2AC, a new model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
designed to train expressive diffusion policies online effectively. At its core
is a policy improvement objective that avoids the high variance of typical
policy gradients and the complexity of backpropagation through time. This
stable learning process is critically enabled by our second contribution: a
robust distributional critic, which we design through a fusion of
distributional RL and clipped double Q-learning. The resulting algorithm is
highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark of
eighteen hard RL tasks, including Humanoid, Dog, and Shadow Hand domains,
spanning both dense-reward and goal-conditioned RL scenarios. Beyond standard
benchmarks, we also evaluate a biologically motivated predator-prey task to
examine the behavioral robustness and generalization capacity of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出任务级对比性概念，通过任务增强和任务级对比损失实现无监督任务表示聚类，提高小样本分类和元学习的跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小样本分类和元学习方法通常局限于单一数据集，难以在不同领域间迁移知识，存在准确率低、计算成本高、依赖严格假设等问题。

Method: 定义任务增强方法，设计任务级对比损失函数，鼓励任务表示的无监督聚类，该方法轻量级且易于集成到现有算法中。

Result: 在MetaDataset基准测试中表现出优越性能，提高了泛化能力和计算效率，无需任务领域的先验知识。

Conclusion: 任务级对比性方法有效解决了跨域泛化问题，在保持简单性的同时显著提升了小样本学习性能。

Abstract: Few-shot classification and meta-learning methods typically struggle to
generalize across diverse domains, as most approaches focus on a single
dataset, failing to transfer knowledge across various seen and unseen domains.
Existing solutions often suffer from low accuracy, high computational costs,
and rely on restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we introduce the notion of
task-level contrastiveness, a novel approach designed to address issues of
existing methods. We start by introducing simple ways to define task
augmentations, and thereafter define a task-level contrastive loss that
encourages unsupervised clustering of task representations. Our method is
lightweight and can be easily integrated within existing few-shot/meta-learning
algorithms while providing significant benefits. Crucially, it leads to
improved generalization and computational efficiency without requiring prior
knowledge of task domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through different experiments on the MetaDataset benchmark, where it achieves
superior performance without additional complexity.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has expanded opportunities
for innovation but also increased exposure to botnet-driven cyberattacks.
Conventional detection methods often struggle with scalability, privacy, and
adaptability in resource-constrained IoT environments. To address these
challenges, we present a lightweight and privacy-preserving botnet detection
framework based on federated learning. This approach enables distributed
devices to collaboratively train models without exchanging raw data, thus
maintaining user privacy while preserving detection accuracy. A
communication-efficient aggregation strategy is introduced to reduce overhead,
ensuring suitability for constrained IoT networks. Experiments on benchmark IoT
botnet datasets demonstrate that the framework achieves high detection accuracy
while substantially reducing communication costs. These findings highlight
federated learning as a practical path toward scalable, secure, and

TL;DR: RAPID是一种新颖的强化学习算法，通过大批量推理和小批量策略梯度更新，将运行时间减少11%-34%，同时保持或提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在微调小型语言模型时资源密集且耗时，需要同时进行推理和反向传播训练。

Method: 采用大批量推理和小批量策略梯度更新，结合组优势估计和重要性加权估计器来纠正离策略学习的偏差。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，运行时间减少11%-34%，同时保持相似或更好的准确性。

Conclusion: RAPID算法有效减少了强化学习的运行时间，为资源密集型任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising strategy for
finetuning small language models (SLMs) to solve targeted tasks such as math
and coding. However, RL algorithms tend to be resource-intensive, taking a
significant amount of time to train. We propose RAPID, a novel RL algorithm
that can substantially reduce the running time of RL. Our key insight is that
RL tends to be costly due to the need to perform both inference and
backpropagation during training. To maximize use of computational resources,
our algorithm performs inference in large batches, and then performs off-policy
policy gradient updates in mini-batches. For off-policy updates, we incorporate
group advantage estimation into the policy gradient algorithm, and derive an
importance weighted estimator to correct for the bias arising from off-policy
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can reduce running
time by 11%-34% on three benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art RL algorithms
while maintaining similar or better accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CMDP的方法存在两个主要问题：对评分机制高度敏感，以及双变量调优计算成本高且无法提供可证明的安全保证。

Method: 引入Certifiable Safe-RLHF (CS-RLHF)，使用大规模语料库训练的成本模型分配语义安全分数，采用基于精确惩罚函数的修正惩罚机制。

Result: 实证评估显示CS-RLHF优于最先进的LLM模型响应，对正常和越狱提示的效率至少提高5倍。

Conclusion: CS-RLHF通过语义基础的安全评分和惩罚机制，有效解决了现有方法的安全性和效率问题。

Abstract: Ensuring safety is a foundational requirement for large language models
(LLMs). Achieving an appropriate balance between enhancing the utility of model
outputs and mitigating their potential for harm is a complex and persistent
challenge. Contemporary approaches frequently formalize this problem within the
framework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) and employ
established CMDP optimization techniques. However, these methods exhibit two
notable limitations. First, their reliance on reward and cost functions renders
performance highly sensitive to the underlying scoring mechanism, which must
capture semantic meaning rather than being triggered by superficial keywords.
Second, CMDP-based training entails tuning dual-variable, a process that is
both computationally expensive and does not provide any provable safety
guarantee for a fixed dual variable that can be exploitable through adversarial
jailbreaks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Certifiable Safe-RLHF
(CS-RLHF) that introduces a cost model trained on a large-scale corpus to
assign semantically grounded safety scores. In contrast to the lagrangian-based
approach, CS-RLHF adopts a rectified penalty-based formulation. This design
draws on the theory of exact penalty functions in constrained optimization,
wherein constraint satisfaction is enforced directly through a suitably chosen
penalty term. With an appropriately scaled penalty, feasibility of the safety
constraints can be guaranteed at the optimizer, eliminating the need for
dual-variable updates. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CS-RLHF
outperforms state-of-the-art LLM model responses rendering at-least 5 times
efficient against nominal and jail-breaking prompts

Result: 在1D-1V Vlasov方程应用中，mLaSDI始终优于标准LaSDI，实现了更低的预测误差和更短的训练时间

Conclusion: 多阶段LaSDI框架能有效提高数据驱动降阶模型的准确性和效率

Abstract: Accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations are essential
in many scientific fields but often require computationally expensive solvers,
motivating reduced-order models (ROMs). Latent Space Dynamics Identification
(LaSDI) is a data-driven ROM framework that combines autoencoders with equation
discovery to learn interpretable latent dynamics. However, enforcing latent
dynamics during training can compromise reconstruction accuracy of the model
for simulation data. We introduce multi-stage LaSDI (mLaSDI), a framework that
improves reconstruction and prediction accuracy by sequentially learning
additional decoders to correct residual errors from previous stages. Applied to
the 1D-1V Vlasov equation, mLaSDI consistently outperforms standard LaSDI,
achieving lower prediction errors and reduced training time across a wide range
of architectures.

Abstract: A variety of models have been developed to forecast dengue cases to date.
However, it remains a challenge to predict major dengue outbreaks that need
timely public warnings the most. In this paper, we introduce CrossLag, an
environmentally informed attention that allows for the incorporation of lagging
endogenous signals behind the significant events in the exogenous data into the
architecture of the transformer at low parameter counts. Outbreaks typically
lag behind major changes in climate and oceanic anomalies. We use TimeXer, a
recent general-purpose transformer distinguishing exogenous-endogenous inputs,
as the baseline for this study. Our proposed model outperforms TimeXer by a
considerable margin in detecting and predicting major outbreaks in Singapore
dengue data over a 24-week prediction window.

Conclusion: 该方法在无需分类器的情况下，有效统一了敏感信息遗忘和抗攻击性，为LLM安全提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), more
customization is needed to ensure privacy-preserving and safe generation. We
address this objective from two critical aspects: unlearning of sensitive
information and robustness to jail-breaking attacks. We investigate various
constrained optimization formulations that address both aspects in a
\emph{unified manner}, by finding the smallest possible interventions on LLM
weights that either make a given vocabulary set unreachable or embed the LLM
with robustness to tailored attacks by shifting part of the weights to a
\emph{safer} region. Beyond unifying two key properties, this approach
contrasts with previous work in that it doesn't require an oracle classifier
that is typically not available or represents a computational overhead.
Surprisingly, we find that the simplest point-wise constraint-based
intervention we propose leads to better performance than max-min interventions,
while having a lower computational cost. Comparison against state-of-the-art
defense methods demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: IMMFM能够有效捕捉内在随机性，处理不规则稀疏采样，并生成特定对象的轨迹，在多个任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Generative models for sequential data often struggle with sparsely sampled
and high-dimensional trajectories, typically reducing the learning of dynamics
to pairwise transitions. We propose \textit{Interpolative Multi-Marginal Flow
Matching} (IMMFM), a framework that learns continuous stochastic dynamics
jointly consistent with multiple observed time points. IMMFM employs a
piecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and
jointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a
theoretical condition for stable learning. This design captures intrinsic
stochasticity, handles irregular sparse sampling, and yields subject-specific
trajectories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world longitudinal
neuroimaging datasets show that IMMFM outperforms existing methods in both
forecasting accuracy and further downstream tasks.

Abstract: Fault detection in power distribution grids is critical for ensuring system
reliability and preventing costly outages. Moreover, fault detection
methodologies should remain robust to evolving grid topologies caused by
factors such as reconfigurations, equipment failures, and Distributed Energy
Resource (DER) integration. Current data-driven state-of-the-art methods use
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal modeling and Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for spatial learning, in an RNN+GNN pipeline setting (RGNN in
short). Specifically, for power system fault diagnosis, Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCNs) have been adopted. Yet, various more advanced GNN architectures
have been proposed and adopted in domains outside of power systems. In this
paper, we set out to systematically and consistently benchmark various GNN
architectures in an RNN+GNN pipeline model. Specifically, to the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to (i) propose to use GraphSAGE and Graph Attention
(GAT, GATv2) in an RGNN for fault diagnosis, and (ii) provide a comprehensive
benchmark against earlier proposed RGNN solutions (RGCN) as well as pure RNN
models (especially Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)), particularly (iii) exploring
their generalization potential for deployment in different settings than those
used for training them. Our experimental results on the IEEE 123-node
distribution network show that RGATv2 has superior generalization capabilities,
maintaining high performance with an F1-score reduction of $\sim$12% across
different topology settings. In contrast, pure RNN models largely fail,
experiencing an F1-score reduction of up to $\sim$60%, while other RGNN
variants also exhibit significant performance degradation, i.e., up to

*Mehmet Onurcan Kaya,Desmond Elliott,Dim P. Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种高效的测试时扩展策略TTAug和TTAdapt，通过模型内部特征而非外部监督来提升小型视觉语言模型的性能，在保持计算效率的同时实现一致的性能改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型视觉语言模型计算效率高但泛化能力和下游任务性能较弱，现有测试时扩展方法计算需求大，与小型模型的资源高效设计目标相矛盾。

Method: 提出两种测试时扩展策略：(1) TTAug：生成多个增强输入并在token级别聚合输出，无需参数更新；(2) TTAdapt：使用TTAug的共识伪标签在推理时自适应调整模型参数。

Result: 在九个基准测试中展示了持续的性能改进，同时保持了适合资源受限环境的计算效率。该方法在不同规模模型和不同VLM之间具有通用性，无需额外调优。

Conclusion: 提出的TTAug和TTAdapt方法有效解决了小型视觉语言模型的性能限制，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了泛化能力和任务性能，具有很好的通用性。

Abstract: Small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide a computationally efficient
alternative to larger models, at the cost of weaker generalization abilities
and downstream task performance. These shortcomings could be addressed by
test-time scaling techniques, but existing methods are typically
computationally demanding, contradicting the resource-efficient design goals of
small models. To address these limitations, we propose two novel and efficient
test-time scaling strategies that leverage the model-internal features rather
than external supervision: (i) Test-Time Augmentation (TTAug), which generates
multiple augmented inputs and aggregates outputs at the token level without
parameter updates, and (ii) Test-Time Adaptation (TTAdapt), which adapts model
parameters during inference using consensus-based pseudolabels from TTAug.
Through extensive experiments across nine benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent
performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency suitable
for resource-constrained environments. The generality of our approach is
demonstrated both within models at different scales and across different VLMs
without additional tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了边界条件保证的进化Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(BEKAN)，通过三种可组合的方法精确实施Dirichlet、周期性和Neumann边界条件，在PDE求解中优于MLP和B样条KAN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在求解PDE方面受到关注，但神经网络的黑盒特性阻碍了边界条件的精确实施，需要开发能够严格保证边界条件的方法。

Method: 使用高斯径向基函数构建单变量基函数近似解并在网络激活层编码边界信息；采用正弦函数构造周期层精确实施周期性边界条件；设计最小二乘公式引导参数演化满足Neumann条件。

Result: 在Dirichlet、Neumann、周期性和混合边界值问题上进行了广泛数值实验，结果显示BEKAN在精度上优于多层感知机和B样条KAN。

Conclusion: 所提方法增强了KAN在求解PDE问题同时满足边界条件的能力，有助于推动科学计算和工程应用的发展。

Abstract: Deep learning has gained attention for solving PDEs, but the black-box nature
of neural networks hinders precise enforcement of boundary conditions. To
address this, we propose a boundary condition-guaranteed evolutionary
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with radial basis functions (BEKAN). In BEKAN,
we propose three distinct and combinable approaches for incorporating
Dirichlet, periodic, and Neumann boundary conditions into the network. For
Dirichlet problem, we use smooth and global Gaussian RBFs to construct
univariate basis functions for approximating the solution and to encode
boundary information at the activation level of the network. To handle periodic
problems, we employ a periodic layer constructed from a set of sinusoidal
functions to enforce the boundary conditions exactly. For a Neumann problem, we
devise a least-squares formulation to guide the parameter evolution toward
satisfying the Neumann condition. By virtue of the boundary-embedded RBFs, the
periodic layer, and the evolutionary framework, we can perform accurate PDE
simulations while rigorously enforcing boundary conditions. For demonstration,
we conducted extensive numerical experiments on Dirichlet, Neumann, periodic,
and mixed boundary value problems. The results indicate that BEKAN outperforms
both multilayer perceptron (MLP) and B-splines KAN in terms of accuracy. In
conclusion, the proposed approach enhances the capability of KANs in solving
PDE problems while satisfying boundary conditions, thereby facilitating
advancements in scientific computing and engineering applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Latent MoS模型，通过混合对称性捕捉复杂动态系统中的潜在因子，在保持局部对称变换的同时提高样本效率，在插值和外推任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设单一全局对称群，并将对称性发现与动态学习分离，导致表达能力有限和误差累积。需要更有效的模型来从复杂动态测量中学习对称性。

Method: 提出Latent Mixture of Symmetries (Latent MoS)模型，捕捉对称性支配的潜在因子混合，通过分层架构堆叠MoS块来保持长期等变性。

Result: 在多种物理系统中的数值实验表明，Latent MoS在插值和外推任务中优于最先进的基线方法，并提供可解释的潜在表示。

Conclusion: Latent MoS能够有效学习复杂动态系统的对称性，提高样本效率，适用于未来几何和安全关键分析。

Abstract: Learning dynamics is essential for model-based control and Reinforcement
Learning in engineering systems, such as robotics and power systems. However,
limited system measurements, such as those from low-resolution sensors, demand
sample-efficient learning. Symmetry provides a powerful inductive bias by
characterizing equivariant relations in system states to improve sample
efficiency. While recent methods attempt to discover symmetries from data, they
typically assume a single global symmetry group and treat symmetry discovery
and dynamic learning as separate tasks, leading to limited expressiveness and
error accumulation. In this paper, we propose the Latent Mixture of Symmetries
(Latent MoS), an expressive model that captures a mixture of symmetry-governed
latent factors from complex dynamical measurements. Latent MoS focuses on
dynamic learning while locally and provably preserving the underlying symmetric
transformations. To further capture long-term equivariance, we introduce a
hierarchical architecture that stacks MoS blocks. Numerical experiments in
diverse physical systems demonstrate that Latent MoS outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in interpolation and extrapolation tasks while
offering interpretable latent representations suitable for future geometric and
safety-critical analyses.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FieldFormer是一个基于Transformer的框架，用于从稀疏、噪声、不规则时空传感器数据中重建物理场，结合数据驱动灵活性和物理约束，在三个基准测试中比基线方法提升40%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有插值或学习方法在处理稀疏、噪声、不规则的时空传感器数据时存在局限：要么忽略控制PDE，要么无法扩展。需要结合数据驱动灵活性和物理基础结构的方法。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的框架，为每个查询点通过可学习的速度缩放距离度量收集局部邻域，实现各向异性适应不同传播机制。通过每批次偏移重计算高效构建邻域，在速度尺度演化时以期望最大化风格进行细化。预测由局部Transformer编码器完成，通过基于自动微分的PDE残差和边界特定惩罚强制物理一致性。

Result: 在三个基准测试（标量各向异性热方程、矢量值浅水系统、现实平流扩散污染模拟）中，FieldFormer始终比强基线方法表现优异40%以上，能够从稀疏（0.4%-2%）和噪声（10%）数据实现准确（RMSE<10^-2）、高效且物理一致的场重建。

Conclusion: FieldFormer证明了结合数据驱动灵活性和物理约束的Transformer框架能够有效处理稀疏、噪声、不规则的时空传感器数据，实现准确、高效且物理一致的场重建。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal sensor data is often sparse, noisy, and irregular, and
existing interpolation or learning methods struggle here because they either
ignore governing PDEs or do not scale. We introduce FieldFormer, a
transformer-based framework for mesh-free spatio-temporal field reconstruction
that combines data-driven flexibility with physics-based structure. For each
query, FieldFormer gathers a local neighborhood using a learnable
velocity-scaled distance metric, enabling anisotropic adaptation to different
propagation regimes. Neighborhoods are built efficiently via per-batch offset
recomputation, and refined in an expectation-maximization style as the velocity
scales evolve. Predictions are made by a local transformer encoder, and physics
consistency is enforced through autograd-based PDE residuals and
boundary-specific penalties. Across three benchmarks--a scalar anisotropic heat
equation, a vector-valued shallow-water system, and a realistic
advection-diffusion pollution simulation--FieldFormer consistently outperforms
strong baselines by more than 40%. Our results demonstrate that FieldFormer
enables accurate (RMSE$<10^{-2}$), efficient, and physically consistent field
reconstruction from sparse (0.4%-2%) and noisy(10%) data.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在通信受限的拥挤环境中实现可扩展去中心化多智能体协调的解决方案，涌现出类似自然界的协调策略。

Abstract: We address the challenge of coordinating multiple robots in narrow and
confined environments, where congestion and interference often hinder
collective task performance. Drawing inspiration from insect colonies, which
achieve robust coordination through stigmergy -- modifying and interpreting
environmental traces -- we propose a Stigmergic Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement
Learning (S-MADRL) framework that leverages virtual pheromones to model local
and social interactions, enabling decentralized emergent coordination without
explicit communication. To overcome the convergence and scalability limitations
of existing algorithms such as MADQN, MADDPG, and MAPPO, we leverage curriculum
learning, which decomposes complex tasks into progressively harder
sub-problems. Simulation results show that our framework achieves the most
effective coordination of up to eight agents, where robots self-organize into
asymmetric workload distributions that reduce congestion and modulate group
performance. This emergent behavior, analogous to strategies observed in
nature, demonstrates a scalable solution for decentralized multi-agent
coordination in crowded environments with communication constraints.

TL;DR: 提出多层移动边缘计算(MLMEC)框架，结合知识蒸馏(KD)技术来平衡跌倒检测系统的准确性和延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着老龄化人口增加，跌倒检测系统的重要性日益凸显。传统架构面临边缘设备模型尺寸有限和向云端传输数据延迟的挑战。

Method: 使用多层MEC框架将架构分为多个站点，每个站点配备神经网络模型。如果前端设备无法可靠检测跌倒，数据会传输到具有更强后端计算能力的站点。采用知识蒸馏方法提高前端检测准确性。

Result: 知识蒸馏方法在SisFall数据集上准确率提高11.65%，在FallAllD数据集上提高2.78%。带KD的MLMEC相比无KD的MLMEC，在FallAllD数据集上数据延迟率降低54.15%，在SisFall数据集上降低46.67%。

Conclusion: MLMEC跌倒检测系统在准确性和延迟方面都得到了改善。

Abstract: The rising aging population has increased the importance of fall detection
(FD) systems as an assistive technology, where deep learning techniques are
widely applied to enhance accuracy. FD systems typically use edge devices (EDs)
worn by individuals to collect real-time data, which are transmitted to a cloud
center (CC) or processed locally. However, this architecture faces challenges
such as a limited ED model size and data transmission latency to the CC. Mobile
edge computing (MEC), which allows computations at MEC servers deployed between
EDs and CC, has been explored to address these challenges. We propose a
multilayer MEC (MLMEC) framework to balance accuracy and latency. The MLMEC
splits the architecture into stations, each with a neural network model. If
front-end equipment cannot detect falls reliably, data are transmitted to a
station with more robust back-end computing. The knowledge distillation (KD)
approach was employed to improve front-end detection accuracy by allowing
high-power back-end stations to provide additional learning experiences,
enhancing precision while reducing latency and processing loads. Simulation
results demonstrate that the KD approach improved accuracy by 11.65% on the
SisFall dataset and 2.78% on the FallAllD dataset. The MLMEC with KD also
reduced the data latency rate by 54.15% on the FallAllD dataset and 46.67% on
the SisFall dataset compared to the MLMEC without KD. In summary, the MLMEC FD
system exhibits improved accuracy and reduced latency.

Motivation: 涡轮风扇发动机的RUL预测在预测性维护中至关重要，但面临数据有限和运行条件变化导致的分布偏移问题。领域自适应技术能够从数据丰富的源域向数据稀缺的目标域转移知识，同时缓解分布偏移。

Method: 提出了一种针对涡轮风扇发动机特性的新分类法，将方法分为基于方法论的（如何应用DA）、基于对齐的（分布偏移发生的位置）和基于问题的（为何需要特定适应）。该分类法超越了传统分类，考虑了涡轮风扇发动机数据的独特特征。

Result: 对选定的DA技术在涡轮风扇发动机数据集上进行了评估，为从业者提供了实用见解，并识别了关键挑战。

Conclusion: 确定了未来研究方向，以指导开发更有效的DA技术，推进涡轮风扇发动机RUL预测的发展。

Abstract: Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction for turbofan engines plays a vital
role in predictive maintenance, ensuring operational safety and efficiency in
aviation. Although data-driven approaches using machine learning and deep
learning have shown potential, they face challenges such as limited data and
distribution shifts caused by varying operating conditions. Domain Adaptation
(DA) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling knowledge transfer from
source domains with abundant data to target domains with scarce data while
mitigating distributional shifts. Given the unique properties of turbofan
engines, such as complex operating conditions, high-dimensional sensor data,
and slower-changing signals, it is essential to conduct a focused review of DA
techniques specifically tailored to turbofan engines. To address this need,
this paper provides a comprehensive review of DA solutions for turbofan engine
RUL prediction, analyzing key methodologies, challenges, and recent
advancements. A novel taxonomy tailored to turbofan engines is introduced,
organizing approaches into methodology-based (how DA is applied),
alignment-based (where distributional shifts occur due to operational
variations), and problem-based (why certain adaptations are needed to address
specific challenges). This taxonomy offers a multidimensional view that goes
beyond traditional classifications by accounting for the distinctive
characteristics of turbofan engine data and the standard process of applying DA
techniques to this area. Additionally, we evaluate selected DA techniques on
turbofan engine datasets, providing practical insights for practitioners and
identifying key challenges. Future research directions are identified to guide
the development of more effective DA techniques, advancing the state of RUL
prediction for turbofan engines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ADAM优化器在逃离局部最小值方面的局限性，避免算法在访问的第一个最小值处过早收敛。

Method: 首先推导ADAM优化器在特定模型状态下的步长分析近似，然后提出Hill-ADAM算法，该算法在误差最小化和最大化之间交替进行，最大化用于逃离局部最小值，最小化用于后续优化。

Result: 在5个损失函数和12个图像颜色校正实例上进行了测试，证明了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: Hill-ADAM通过交替最小化和最大化的策略，实现了对损失空间的整体探索，能够有效逃离局部最小值并找到全局最小值。

Abstract: This paper introduces Hill-ADAM. Hill-ADAM is an optimizer with its focus
towards escaping local minima in prescribed loss landscapes to find the global
minimum. Hill-ADAM escapes minima by deterministically exploring the state
space. This eliminates uncertainty from random gradient updates in stochastic
algorithms while seldom converging at the first minimum that visits. In the
paper we first derive an analytical approximation of the ADAM Optimizer step
size at a particular model state. From there define the primary condition
determining ADAM limitations in escaping local minima. The proposed optimizer
algorithm Hill-ADAM alternates between error minimization and maximization. It
maximizes to escape the local minimum and minimizes again afterward. This
alternation provides an overall exploration throughout the loss space. This
allows the deduction of the global minimum's state. Hill-ADAM was tested with 5
loss functions and 12 amber-saturated to cooler-shade image color correction
instances.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在部分可观测系统中，传统的贝叶斯滤波器计算复杂度高，而粒子滤波器容易遭受粒子贫乏问题。需要一种既能高效计算又能表达复杂信念分布的方法。

Method: NBF训练找到任务诱导信念的良好潜在表示，将信念映射到固定长度的嵌入向量，这些向量条件化生成模型进行采样。在滤波过程中，使用粒子式更新在嵌入空间中计算后验分布。

Result: 在三个部分可观测环境的状态估计任务中验证了NBF的有效性，能够跟踪快速变化的多模态信念，同时减轻粒子贫乏风险。

Conclusion: NBF成功结合了经典滤波器的计算效率和深度生成模型的表达能力，为部分可观测系统提供了一种有效的信念跟踪方法。

Abstract: We present Neural Bayesian Filtering (NBF), an algorithm for maintaining
distributions over hidden states, called beliefs, in partially observable
systems. NBF is trained to find a good latent representation of the beliefs
induced by a task. It maps beliefs to fixed-length embedding vectors, which
condition generative models for sampling. During filtering, particle-style
updates compute posteriors in this embedding space using incoming observations
and the environment's dynamics. NBF combines the computational efficiency of
classical filters with the expressiveness of deep generative models - tracking
rapidly shifting, multimodal beliefs while mitigating the risk of particle
impoverishment. We validate NBF in state estimation tasks in three partially
observable environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测短期股票价格变动具有挑战性，因为市场具有固有的波动性且对投资者情绪敏感。需要整合社交媒体情感数据来改进预测模型。

Method: 使用Meta的Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct预处理推文数据，结合三种情感分析方法（基于Transformer的DistilRoBERTa分类器和两种基于词典的方法），将情感特征与历史股价数据结合训练LSTM模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，所有三种情感分析方法都提高了预测股票价格大幅波动的平均准确率。基线模型仅使用历史股价数据的准确率为13.5%，而基于DistilRoBERTa的股票预测模型在使用LLaMA增强情感分析后，准确率从23.6%提升到38.5%。

Conclusion: 使用大型语言模型预处理推文内容可以增强情感分析的有效性，进而提高预测股票价格大幅波动的准确性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting short-term stock price movement remains a challenging
task due to the market's inherent volatility and sensitivity to investor
sentiment. This paper discusses a deep learning framework that integrates
emotion features extracted from tweet data with historical stock price
information to forecast significant price changes on the following day. We
utilize Meta's Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct model to preprocess tweet data, thereby
enhancing the quality of emotion features derived from three emotion analysis
approaches: a transformer-based DistilRoBERTa classifier from the Hugging Face
library and two lexicon-based methods using National Research Council Canada
(NRC) resources. These features are combined with previous-day stock price data
to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Experimental results on TSLA,
AAPL, and AMZN stocks show that all three emotion analysis methods improve the
average accuracy for predicting significant price movements, compared to the
baseline model using only historical stock prices, which yields an accuracy of
13.5%. The DistilRoBERTa-based stock prediction model achieves the best
performance, with accuracy rising from 23.6% to 38.5% when using LLaMA-enhanced
emotion analysis. These results demonstrate that using large language models to
preprocess tweet content enhances the effectiveness of emotion analysis which
in turn improves the accuracy of predicting significant stock price movements.

Conclusion: 研究强调了ICL在攻击下的脆弱性，以及谱防御在使AI系统对健康相关社交媒体监控更可靠方面的价值，为稳健LLM部署提供了风险认知和防御方案。

Abstract: This study explored how in-context learning (ICL) in large language models
can be disrupted by data poisoning attacks in the setting of public health
sentiment analysis. Using tweets of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), small
adversarial perturbations such as synonym replacement, negation insertion, and
randomized perturbation were introduced into the support examples. Even these
minor manipulations caused major disruptions, with sentiment labels flipping in
up to 67% of cases. To address this, a Spectral Signature Defense was applied,
which filtered out poisoned examples while keeping the data's meaning and
sentiment intact. After defense, ICL accuracy remained steady at around 46.7%,
and logistic regression validation reached 100% accuracy, showing that the
defense successfully preserved the dataset's integrity. Overall, the findings
extend prior theoretical studies of ICL poisoning to a practical, high-stakes
setting in public health discourse analysis, highlighting both the risks and
potential defenses for robust LLM deployment. This study also highlights the
fragility of ICL under attack and the value of spectral defenses in making AI
systems more reliable for health-related social media monitoring.

Motivation: 理解隐式模型如何通过增加测试时计算来匹配甚至超越更大显式网络性能的机制，目前对此缺乏理论解释。

Method: 通过非参数分析研究表达能力，证明简单的隐式算子通过迭代可以渐进表达更复杂的映射，其表达能力随测试时计算量扩展。

Result: 理论在图像重建、科学计算和运筹学三个领域得到验证，随着测试时迭代增加，学习映射的复杂度上升，解质量同时提高并稳定。

Conclusion: 隐式模型通过测试时计算量的增加实现表达能力扩展，这一机制为设计更高效的深度学习架构提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Implicit models, an emerging model class, compute outputs by iterating a
single parameter block to a fixed point. This architecture realizes an
infinite-depth, weight-tied network that trains with constant memory,
significantly reducing memory needs for the same level of performance compared
to explicit models. While it is empirically known that these compact models can
often match or even exceed larger explicit networks by allocating more
test-time compute, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.
  We study this gap through a nonparametric analysis of expressive power. We
provide a strict mathematical characterization, showing that a simple and
regular implicit operator can, through iteration, progressively express more
complex mappings. We prove that for a broad class of implicit models, this
process lets the model's expressive power scale with test-time compute,
ultimately matching a much richer function class. The theory is validated
across three domains: image reconstruction, scientific computing, and
operations research, demonstrating that as test-time iterations increase, the
complexity of the learned mapping rises, while the solution quality
simultaneously improves and stabilizes.

Conclusion: 该方法为训练针对个体患者需求的个性化RL智能体开辟了可能性，推动了RL在临床DBS中的应用。

Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a highly effective treatment for Parkinson's
Disease (PD). Recent research uses reinforcement learning (RL) for DBS, with RL
agents modulating the stimulation frequency and amplitude. But, these models
rely on biomarkers that are not measurable in patients and are only present in
brain-on-chip (BoC) simulations. In this work, we present an RL-based DBS
approach that adapts these stimulation parameters according to brain activity
measurable in vivo. Using a TD3 based RL agent trained on a model of the basal
ganglia region of the brain, we see a greater suppression of biomarkers
correlated with PD severity compared to modern clinical DBS implementations.
Our agent outperforms the standard clinical approaches in suppressing PD
biomarkers while relying on information that can be measured in a real world
environment, thereby opening up the possibility of training personalized RL
agents specific to individual patient needs.

Abstract: Continuous learning of novel classes is crucial for edge devices to preserve
data privacy and maintain reliable performance in dynamic environments.
However, the scenario becomes particularly challenging when data samples are
insufficient, requiring on-device few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL)
to maintain consistent model performance. Although existing work has explored
parameter-efficient FSCIL frameworks based on artificial neural networks
(ANNs), their deployment is still fundamentally constrained by limited device
resources. Inspired by neural mechanisms, Spiking neural networks (SNNs)
process spatiotemporal information efficiently, offering lower energy
consumption, greater biological plausibility, and compatibility with
neuromorphic hardware than ANNs. In this work, we present an SNN-based method
for On-Device FSCIL, i.e., Sparsity-Aware and Fast Adaptive SNN (SAFA-SNN). We
first propose sparsity-conditioned neuronal dynamics, in which most neurons
remain stable while a subset stays active, thereby mitigating catastrophic
forgetting. To further cope with spike non-differentiability in gradient
estimation, we employ zeroth-order optimization. Moreover, during incremental
learning sessions, we enhance the discriminability of new classes through
subspace projection, which alleviates overfitting to novel classes. Extensive
experiments conducted on two standard benchmark datasets (CIFAR100 and
Mini-ImageNet) and three neuromorphic datasets (CIFAR-10-DVS, DVS128gesture,
and N-Caltech101) demonstrate that SAFA-SNN outperforms baseline methods,
specifically achieving at least 4.01% improvement at the last incremental
session on Mini-ImageNet and 20% lower energy cost over baseline methods with
practical implementation.

*Amir Sadikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用LLM引导的进化程序合成方法解决两个长期存在的QMC设计问题：构建低星差异的有限2D/3D点集和优化Sobol'方向数以最小化随机QMC误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维积分中准蒙特卡洛方法的两个长期设计问题：有限点集的低星差异构造和Sobol'方向数的优化选择。

Method: 采用两阶段程序：构造性代码提案与迭代数值优化相结合，使用LLM引导的进化循环在任务特定适应度下变异和选择代码。

Result: 在2D情况下重新发现已知最优解并创下N≥40的新最佳基准，在3D情况下匹配大多数已知最优解并报告改进的基准；在数字序列方面，进化的Sobol'参数在32维期权定价任务中相对于广泛使用的Joe-Kuo参数持续降低rQMC均方误差。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的进化程序合成可以自动化发现高质量的QMC构造，在经典设计最优时恢复它们，在有限N结构重要时改进它们。

Abstract: Low-discrepancy point sets and digital sequences underpin quasi-Monte Carlo
(QMC) methods for high-dimensional integration. We cast two long-standing QMC
design problems as program synthesis and solve them with an LLM-guided
evolutionary loop that mutates and selects code under task-specific fitness:
(i) constructing finite 2D/3D point sets with low star discrepancy, and (ii)
choosing Sobol' direction numbers that minimize randomized QMC error on
downstream integrands. Our two-phase procedure combines constructive code
proposals with iterative numerical refinement. On finite sets, we rediscover
known optima in small 2D cases and set new best-known 2D benchmarks for N >=
40, while matching most known 3D optima up to the proven frontier (N <= 8) and
reporting improved 3D benchmarks beyond. On digital sequences, evolving Sobol'
parameters yields consistent reductions in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (rQMC)
mean-squared error for several 32-dimensional option-pricing tasks relative to
widely used Joe--Kuo parameters, while preserving extensibility to any sample
size and compatibility with standard randomizations. Taken together, the
results demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary program synthesis can automate
the discovery of high-quality QMC constructions, recovering classical designs
where they are optimal and improving them where finite-N structure matters.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于AEMO电价预测的BESS交易算法，通过分析预测准确性模式来优化套利收益，并与无预测的基本算法进行性能对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电网波动性增加，将预测转化为实际交易策略的需求日益迫切。虽然AEMO提供了丰富的电价预测数据，但这些数据在实际BESS交易决策中的应用价值尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 分析AEMO电价预测的准确性模式（基于时间、预测周期和地区差异），创建基于预测的BESS交易模型，并探索使用机器学习技术增强AEMO预测来指导更先进的交易策略。

Result: 开发了一个新颖的基于预测的BESS交易模型，用于优化套利财务回报，并与无预测的基本交易算法进行了基准测试。

Conclusion: 该研究为能源市场交易模型的未来改进提供了信息，并促进BESS更有效地融入市场运营。

Abstract: In electricity markets around the world, the ability to anticipate price
movements with precision can be the difference between profit and loss,
especially for fast-acting assets like battery energy storage systems (BESS).
As grid volatility increases due to renewables and market decentralisation,
operators and forecasters alike face growing pressure to transform prediction
into strategy. Yet while forecast data is abundant, especially in advanced
markets like Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM), its practical value
in driving real-world BESS trading decisions remains largely unexplored. This
thesis dives into that gap. This work addresses a key research question: Can
the accuracy of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) energy price
forecasts be systematically leveraged to develop a reliable and profitable
battery energy storage system trading algorithm? Despite the availability of
AEMO price forecasts, no existing framework evaluates their reliability or
incorporates them into practical BESS trading strategies. By analysing patterns
in forecast accuracy based on time of day, forecast horizon, and regional
variations, this project creates a novel, forecast-informed BESS trading model
to optimise arbitrage financial returns. The performance of this
forecast-driven algorithm is benchmarked against a basic trading algorithm with
no knowledge of forecast data. The study further explores the potential of
machine learning techniques to predict future energy prices by enhancing AEMO
forecasts to govern a more advanced trading strategy. The research outcomes
will inform future improvements in energy market trading models and promote
more efficient BESS integration into market operations.

### [371] [Does higher interpretability imply better utility? A Pairwise Analysis on Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03659)
*Xu Wang,Yan Hu,Benyou Wang,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现稀疏自编码器(SAE)的可解释性与模型行为控制效用之间仅存在弱正相关，提出了新的特征选择标准Delta Token Confidence，显著提升了控制性能并消除了可解释性与效用之间的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证稀疏自编码器(SAE)的可解释性是否真的意味着更好的模型控制效用，因为当前基于SAE控制LLM的方法都假设可解释特征自然具备控制能力。

Method: 在三个LLM上训练90个SAE，涵盖5种架构和6种稀疏度，使用SAEBench和AxBench分别评估可解释性和控制效用，通过Kendall秩相关系数分析关联性，并提出Delta Token Confidence特征选择标准。

Result: 可解释性与控制效用仅存在弱正相关(tau b ≈ 0.298)，使用Delta Token Confidence选择特征后，控制性能提升52.52%，且可解释性与效用的相关性消失甚至变为负相关。

Conclusion: 可解释性不能作为控制效用的可靠代理指标，Delta Token Confidence是更有效的特征选择标准，最有效的控制特征往往与可解释性无关。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used to steer large language models
(LLMs), based on the assumption that their interpretable features naturally
enable effective model behavior steering. Yet, a fundamental question remains
unanswered: does higher interpretability indeed imply better steering utility?
To answer this question, we train 90 SAEs across three LLMs (Gemma-2-2B,
Qwen-2.5-3B, Gemma-2-9B), spanning five architectures and six sparsity levels,
and evaluate their interpretability and steering utility based on SAEBench
(arXiv:2501.12345) and AxBench (arXiv:2502.23456) respectively, and perform a
rank-agreement analysis via Kendall's rank coefficients (tau b). Our analysis
reveals only a relatively weak positive association (tau b approx 0.298),
indicating that interpretability is an insufficient proxy for steering
performance. We conjecture the interpretability utility gap may stem from the
selection of SAE features, as not all of them are equally effective for
steering. To further find features that truly steer the behavior of LLMs, we
propose a novel selection criterion called Delta Token Confidence, which
measures how much amplifying a feature changes the next token distribution. We
show that our method improves the steering performance of three LLMs by 52.52
percent compared to the current best output score based criterion
(arXiv:2503.34567). Strikingly, after selecting features with high Delta Token
Confidence, the correlation between interpretability and utility vanishes (tau
b approx 0), and can even become negative. This further highlights the
divergence between interpretability and utility for the most effective steering
features.

*Jijie Zhou,Niloofar Mireshghallah,Tianshi Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个数据最小化框架，通过优先级队列树搜索在隐私有序转换空间中寻找最优数据披露点，在保持效用的同时最小化隐私泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在消费应用中的快速部署导致个人信息频繁交换，用户为获取有用响应往往过度分享信息，增加了通过记忆、上下文个性化或安全漏洞带来的隐私风险。

Method: 开发了一个框架来形式化定义和操作数据最小化：对于给定的用户提示和响应模型，量化在保持效用的前提下最不泄露隐私的披露程度，并提出优先级队列树搜索来在隐私有序转换空间中定位这个最优点。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估显示，前沿的大型LLMs能够容忍更强的数据最小化同时保持任务质量（GPT-5可承受85.7%的删减，而Qwen2.5-0.5B只能承受19.3%）。LLMs难以直接预测最优数据最小化，显示出偏向抽象的偏见导致过度分享。

Conclusion: 这不仅是隐私差距，更是能力差距：模型可能缺乏对解决任务实际需要什么信息的认知。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language models (LLMs) in consumer applications
has led to frequent exchanges of personal information. To obtain useful
responses, users often share more than necessary, increasing privacy risks via
memorization, context-based personalization, or security breaches. We present a
framework to formally define and operationalize data minimization: for a given
user prompt and response model, quantifying the least privacy-revealing
disclosure that maintains utility, and we propose a priority-queue tree search
to locate this optimal point within a privacy-ordered transformation space. We
evaluated the framework on four datasets spanning open-ended conversations
(ShareGPT, WildChat) and knowledge-intensive tasks with single-ground-truth
answers (CaseHold, MedQA), quantifying achievable data minimization with nine
LLMs as the response model. Our results demonstrate that larger frontier LLMs
can tolerate stronger data minimization while maintaining task quality than
smaller open-source models (85.7% redaction for GPT-5 vs. 19.3% for
Qwen2.5-0.5B). By comparing with our search-derived benchmarks, we find that
LLMs struggle to predict optimal data minimization directly, showing a bias
toward abstraction that leads to oversharing. This suggests not just a privacy
gap, but a capability gap: models may lack awareness of what information they
actually need to solve a task.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Token Hidden Reward (THR)指标，通过分析token对正确回答概率的影响来量化探索与利用。基于THR的重新加权算法可以明确控制强化学习训练中的探索-利用平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习显著提升了大型语言模型的推理能力，但如何明确控制训练过程中的探索与利用平衡仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 引入Token Hidden Reward (THR)指标，量化每个token在GRPO下对正确回答概率的影响。开发了THR引导的重新加权算法，通过放大正THR token（促进利用）或负THR token（促进探索）来调节学习信号。

Result: 在多样化数学推理基准测试中验证了算法的有效性：放大正THR token提高了贪婪解码准确率（利用），而放大负THR token提升了Pass@K准确率（探索）。算法与GSPO等其他RL目标兼容，并在Llama等架构上具有通用性。

Conclusion: THR为RL调优的LLM提供了一种原则性、细粒度的机制来动态控制探索与利用，为目标微调提供了新工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet how to explicitly steer
training toward exploration or exploitation remains an open problem. We
introduce Token Hidden Reward (THR), a token-level metric that quantifies each
token's influence on the likelihood of correct responses under Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). We find that training dynamics are dominated by a
small subset of tokens with high absolute THR values. Most interestingly,
tokens with positive THR strengthen confidence in correct outputs, thus
favoring exploitation, while tokens with negative THR preserve probability mass
for alternative outputs, enabling exploration. This insight suggests a natural
intervention: a THR-guided reweighting algorithm that modulates GRPO's learning
signals to explicitly bias training toward exploitation or exploration. We
validate the efficacy of this algorithm on diverse math reasoning benchmarks.
By amplifying tokens with positive THR value and weakening negative ones, our
algorithm improves greedy-decoding accuracy, favoring exploitation. The reverse
strategy yields consistent gains in Pass@K accuracy, favoring exploration. We
further demonstrate that our algorithm integrates seamlessly with other RL
objectives such as GSPO and generalizes across architectures including Llama.
These findings establish THR as a principled and fine-grained mechanism for
dynamically controlling exploration and exploitation in RL-tuned LLMs,
providing new tools for targeted fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive
applications.

Additionally, our framework exhibits scalability and broad applicability across
various model architectures and domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受GRPO在RLHF中成功启发，旨在消除训练critic所需的内存、计算和超参数成本，同时保持PPO的clipped-objective结构。

Method: 使用基于组的蒙特卡洛优势估计器替代学习值函数，保留PPO的clipped-objective结构，无需训练critic。

Result: 理论证明GPG估计器的一致性，分析偏差-方差权衡，实验表明GPG在标准基准上匹配或优于PPO，能更好利用并行模拟，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: GPG作为一种无critic的策略梯度方法，在保持性能的同时显著提高了计算效率，是PPO的有效替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce Group Policy Gradient (GPG), a family of critic-free
policy-gradient estimators for general MDPs. Inspired by the success of GRPO's
approach in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), GPG replaces a
learned value function with a group-based Monte Carlo advantage estimator,
removing the memory, compute, and hyperparameter costs of training a critic
while preserving PPO's clipped-objective structure. We prove the consistency of
the GPG estimator, analyze the bias-variance tradeoffs, and demonstrate
empirically that GPG matches or outperforms PPO on standard benchmarks. GPG
makes better use of parallel simulations, which, together with its critic-free
design, results in more efficient use of computational resources than PPO.

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架，显式建模图数据为图混合模型，通过图矩聚类识别不同生成机制，并应用于图对比学习和数据增强，在无监督和监督学习中都取得了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图数据集通常包含来自多个不同分布的混合种群，但现有图表示学习方法（如图对比学习和Mixup增强）往往忽略这种混合结构。

Method: 1) 使用图矩（模体密度）聚类来自相同图模型的图；2) 提出图混合感知的Mixup增强(GMAM)；3) 提出模型感知的图对比学习(MGCL)，改进负采样策略。

Result: 在无监督学习中，MGCL在8个数据集上获得最高平均排名；在监督学习中，GMAM在7个数据集中的6个上达到新的SOTA准确率。

Conclusion: 显式建模图的混合结构能够有效提升图表示学习性能，所提出的方法在多个任务中均表现出色。

Abstract: Real-world graph datasets often consist of mixtures of populations, where
graphs are generated from multiple distinct underlying distributions. However,
modern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning
(GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture
structure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models
data as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models
represented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph
moments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This
enables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct
generative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph
learning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data
augmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided
by the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2)
For GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally,
by introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL)
improves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other
models. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound
showing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have
similar motif densities with high probability. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate strong empirical performance. In unsupervised
learning, MGCL achieves state-of-the-art results, obtaining the top average
rank across eight datasets. In supervised learning, GMAM consistently
outperforms existing strategies, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy in 6
out of 7 datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: REG优化器通过Row-and-Column-Scaling操作符替代Muon的矩阵符号函数，解决了Muon优化器在训练不稳定性和与AdamW预训练模型微调不兼容的问题，实现了更好的性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器虽然通过正则化梯度更新改进了AdamW，但其依赖矩阵符号函数会导致训练不稳定，且在微调AdamW预训练模型时出现性能下降问题。

Method: 提出REG优化器，用Row-and-Column-Scaling操作符替代Muon的矩阵符号函数，该操作符基于矩阵平衡理论，以更温和的方式正则化更新步骤。

Result: 在LLM训练实验中，REG优化器相比AdamW实现了更优的性能和稳定性，且在微调阶段避免了Muon观察到的性能下降问题。

Conclusion: REG优化器不仅超越了AdamW的性能，还保持了与AdamW训练范式的一致性，特别在微调阶段表现出更好的兼容性。

Abstract: Optimizers are crucial for the efficient training of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While AdamW is the de facto standard, recent structure-aware optimizers
like Muon have emerged, which regularize gradient updates by operating on
entire weight matrices. The Muon optimizer balances the gradient updates along
all the directions. However, Muon's reliance on the matrix sign function can
lead to training instability, exhibits incompatibility when fine-tuning models
pre-trained with AdamW. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REG},
a novel optimizer that replaces Muon's aggressive matrix sign operator with the
Row-and-Column-Scaling (RACS) operator. Theoretically grounded in balancing a
matrix, the RACS operator regularizes the update steps in a less drastic
manner, making it simpler to implement and more compatible with established
training dynamics. Through extensive empirical experiments on LLM training, we
demonstrate that our REG optimizer not only achieves superior performance and
stability over AdamW, but also maintains consistency with the AdamW training
paradigm. This consistency is particularly evident during the fine-tuning
stage, where REG optimizer avoids the performance degradation observed with
Muon.

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力弥合强化学习理论与实际决策之间的差距，在管理场景中提供可解释性、准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied to sequential decision
making, where interpretability and performance are both critical for practical
adoption. Current approaches typically focus on performance and rely on post
hoc explanations to account for interpretability. Different from these
approaches, we focus on designing an interpretability-oriented yet
performance-enhanced RL approach. Specifically, we propose a spectral based
linear RL method that extends the ridge regression-based approach through a
spectral filter function. The proposed method clarifies the role of
regularization in controlling estimation error and further enables the design
of an adaptive regularization parameter selection strategy guided by the
bias-variance trade-off principle. Theoretical analysis establishes
near-optimal bounds for both parameter estimation and generalization error.
Extensive experiments on simulated environments and real-world datasets from
Kuaishou and Taobao demonstrate that our method either outperforms or matches
existing baselines in decision quality. We also conduct interpretability
analyses to illustrate how the learned policies make decisions, thereby
enhancing user trust. These results highlight the potential of our approach to
bridge the gap between RL theory and practical decision making, providing
interpretability, accuracy, and adaptability in management contexts.

Method: 在混合异构场景中构建个性化无偏原型，并在本地更新阶段引入一致性正则化来对齐本地实例与其个性化原型。

Result: 在Digits和Office Caltech数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性，并成功降低了通信成本。

Conclusion: PFPL方法通过利用数据异构性，在保护隐私的同时提升了联邦学习的模型性能。

Abstract: Federated learning has received significant attention for its ability to
simultaneously protect customer privacy and leverage distributed data from
multiple devices for model training. However, conventional approaches often
focus on isolated heterogeneous scenarios, resulting in skewed feature
distributions or label distributions. Meanwhile, data heterogeneity is actually
a key factor in improving model performance. To address this issue, we propose
a new approach called PFPL in mixed heterogeneous scenarios. The method
provides richer domain knowledge and unbiased convergence targets by
constructing personalized, unbiased prototypes for each client. Moreover, in
the local update phase, we introduce consistent regularization to align local
instances with their personalized prototypes, which significantly improves the
convergence of the loss function. Experimental results on Digits and Office
Caltech datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach and successfully
reduce the communication cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然平衡了有效性和参数效率，但其零乘积初始化限制了原始模型权重的有效激活和利用，成为性能优化的瓶颈。

Method: 提出IniLoRA初始化策略，将低秩矩阵初始化为接近原始模型权重，并引入了两个变体IniLoRA-α和IniLoRA-β，采用不同的初始化方法进一步优化性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，IniLoRA在各种模型和任务上都比LoRA表现更好。

Conclusion: IniLoRA通过改进初始化策略有效解决了LoRA的局限性，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The rapid development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods has
noticeably improved the efficiency of adapting large language models. Among
these, LoRA has gained widespread popularity due to its strong balance of
effectiveness and parameter efficiency. However, LoRA relies on initializing
two low-rank matrices whose product is zero, which limits its ability to
effectively activate and leverage the original model weights-creating a
potential bottleneck for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we
propose \textbf{IniLoRA}, a novel initialization strategy that initializes the
low-rank matrices to closely approximate the original model weights.
Experimental results indicate that IniLoRA achieves better performance than
LoRA across a range of models and tasks. Additionally, we introduce two
variants, IniLoRA-$\alpha$ and IniLoRA-$\beta$, both leveraging distinct
initialization methods to enhance performance further.

Motivation: 现实世界中，真实标签通常只在正分类个体中可用（如贷款申请中只有获批者的还款结果可观测），且获取额外标签数据存在实际成本。现有方法在成本效益方面不足。

Result: 在黑盒设置下提出的算法接近最优，且证明自然基线方法严格次优。在混合模型设置下，审计成本显著低于黑盒情况。在真实数据集上，算法比自然基线节省约50%的审计成本。

Conclusion: 提出的公平性审计算法在部分反馈和实际成本约束下具有显著优势，适用于多种流行公平性指标，并在真实数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: We study the problem of auditing the fairness of a given classifier under
partial feedback, where true labels are available only for positively
classified individuals, (e.g., loan repayment outcomes are observed only for
approved applicants). We introduce a novel cost model for acquiring additional
labeled data, designed to more accurately reflect real-world costs such as
credit assessment, loan processing, and potential defaults. Our goal is to find
optimal fairness audit algorithms that are more cost-effective than random
exploration and natural baselines.
  In our work, we consider two audit settings: a black-box model with no
assumptions on the data distribution, and a mixture model, where features and
true labels follow a mixture of exponential family distributions. In the
black-box setting, we propose a near-optimal auditing algorithm under mild
assumptions and show that a natural baseline can be strictly suboptimal. In the
mixture model setting, we design a novel algorithm that achieves significantly
lower audit cost than the black-box case. Our approach leverages prior work on
learning from truncated samples and maximum-a-posteriori oracles, and extends
known results on spherical Gaussian mixtures to handle exponential family
mixtures, which may be of independent interest. Moreover, our algorithms apply
to popular fairness metrics including demographic parity, equal opportunity,
and equalized odds. Empirically, we demonstrate strong performance of our
algorithms on real-world fair classification datasets like Adult Income and Law
School, consistently outperforming natural baselines by around 50% in terms of
audit cost.

Motivation: 小流域的十年尺度日径流预测困难，因为信号包含漂移趋势、多尺度季节周期、状态转移和稀疏极端值。现有深度学习模型通常只针对单一方面且未充分利用未标记数据，限制了状态适应性。

Method: 提出HydroFusion-LMF框架：(1)可学习的趋势-季节-残差分解；(2)通过紧凑异构专家集合处理残差；(3)基于水文上下文感知门融合专家输出；(4)半监督多任务目标增强监督。

Result: 在约10年日数据集上，MSE为1.0128，MAE为0.5818，比最强基线DLinear提升10.2%/10.3%，比平均基线提升24.6%/17.1%。

Conclusion: 该框架在可解释性和性能之间取得平衡，通过显式组件和稀疏门控，推进了非平稳条件下的标签高效水文预测。

Abstract: Accurate decade-scale daily runoff forecasting in small watersheds is
difficult because signals blend drifting trends, multi-scale seasonal cycles,
regime shifts, and sparse extremes. Prior deep models (DLinear, TimesNet,
PatchTST, TiDE, Nonstationary Transformer, LSTNet, LSTM) usually target single
facets and under-utilize unlabeled spans, limiting regime adaptivity. We
propose HydroFusion-LMF, a unified framework that (i) performs a learnable
trend-seasonal-residual decomposition to reduce non-stationarity, (ii) routes
residuals through a compact heterogeneous expert set (linear refinement,
frequency kernel, patch Transformer, recurrent memory, dynamically normalized
attention), (iii) fuses expert outputs via a hydrologic context-aware gate
conditioned on day-of-year phase, antecedent precipitation, local variance,
flood indicators, and static basin attributes, and (iv) augments supervision
with a semi-supervised multi-task objective (composite MSE/MAE + extreme
emphasis + NSE/KGE, masked reconstruction, multi-scale contrastive alignment,
augmentation consistency, variance-filtered pseudo-labeling). Optional adapter
/ LoRA layers inject a frozen foundation time-series encoder efficiently. On a
~10-year daily dataset HydroFusion-LMF attains MSE 1.0128 / MAE 0.5818,
improving the strongest baseline (DLinear) by 10.2% / 10.3% and the mean
baseline by 24.6% / 17.1%. We observe simultaneous MSE and MAE reductions
relative to baselines. The framework balances interpretability (explicit
components, sparse gating) with performance, advancing label-efficient
hydrologic forecasting under non-stationarity.

*Michael Etienne Van Huffel,Nathan Kirk,Makram Chahine,Daniela Rus,T. Konstantin Rusch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroLDS是首个基于机器学习的低差异序列生成框架，通过神经网络将索引映射为点，使所有前缀序列都具有最小差异度，在多个应用中显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低差异点集方法主要依赖抽象代数和数论，而MPMC虽然使用机器学习生成低差异点集，但无法扩展到低差异序列(LDS)。LDS的每个前缀都具有低差异度，这对许多应用至关重要。

Method: 采用两阶段学习过程：首先通过监督学习近似经典构造，然后通过无监督微调最小化前缀差异度。训练神经网络将索引映射为点，生成具有最小前缀差异度的序列。

Result: NeuroLDS在所有先前LDS构造的差异度度量方面显著优于传统方法，并在数值积分、机器人运动规划和科学机器学习等多样化应用中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 神经低差异序列展示了机器学习在生成高质量低差异序列方面的潜力和广泛意义，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-discrepancy points are designed to efficiently fill the space in a
uniform manner. This uniformity is highly advantageous in many problems in
science and engineering, including in numerical integration, computer vision,
machine perception, computer graphics, machine learning, and simulation.
Whereas most previous low-discrepancy constructions rely on abstract algebra
and number theory, Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) was recently introduced
to exploit machine learning methods for generating point sets with lower
discrepancy than previously possible. However, MPMC is limited to generating
point sets and cannot be extended to low-discrepancy sequences (LDS), i.e.,
sequences of points in which every prefix has low discrepancy, a property
essential for many applications. To address this limitation, we introduce
Neural Low-Discrepancy Sequences ($NeuroLDS$), the first machine learning-based
framework for generating LDS. Drawing inspiration from classical LDS, we train
a neural network to map indices to points such that the resulting sequences
exhibit minimal discrepancy across all prefixes. To this end, we deploy a
two-stage learning process: supervised approximation of classical constructions
followed by unsupervised fine-tuning to minimize prefix discrepancies. We
demonstrate that $NeuroLDS$ outperforms all previous LDS constructions by a
significant margin with respect to discrepancy measures. Moreover, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of $NeuroLDS$ across diverse applications,
including numerical integration, robot motion planning, and scientific machine
learning. These results highlight the promise and broad significance of Neural
Low-Discrepancy Sequences. Our code can be found at

TL;DR: 提出了EvoEngineer框架，系统化解决CUDA内核优化的性能与正确性平衡问题，在91个真实CUDA内核上实现平均2.72倍加速和69.8%的代码有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CUDA内核优化是AI性能的关键瓶颈，现有LLM方法存在生态系统碎片化、问题定义不清晰以及无法满足严格正确性要求的问题。

Method: 首先形式化CUDA内核优化任务，然后建立首个系统化的LLM代码进化框架EvoEngineer，提供优化策略设计指导，最后基于该框架实现内核优化系统。

Result: 在91个真实CUDA内核上，EvoEngineer实现了平均2.72倍加速，最高达到36.75倍加速，代码有效性达69.8%，在50个加速超过2倍的操作中，56%的操作实现了最高加速。

Conclusion: EvoEngineer在性能和正确性之间实现了原则性平衡，在CUDA内核优化方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: CUDA kernel optimization has become a critical bottleneck for AI performance,
as deep learning training and inference efficiency directly depends on highly
optimized GPU kernels.
  Despite the promise of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating kernel
optimization, this field suffers from a fragmented ecosystem of isolated and
incomparable approaches with unclear problem formulations.
  Furthermore, general-purpose LLM code evolution methods cannot meet strict
correctness requirements of CUDA kernel optimization.
  We address these fundamental challenges by first formalizing CUDA kernel
optimization as a code optimization task with a clear objective, constraints,
and evaluation metrics.
  We then establish the first systematic LLM-based code evolution framework,
EvoEngineer, that provides guidance for designing and adapting optimization
strategies to achieve a balance between performance and correctness.
  Finally, we implement a kernel optimization system based on this framework
and conduct extensive experiments on 91 real-world CUDA kernels.
  Our results demonstrate that EvoEngineer achieves a principled balance
between performance and correctness, with the highest averaged median speedup
of \textbf{2.72}$\times$ over baseline CUDA kernels and a code validity rate of
\textbf{69.8}\%, outperforming existing methods on both dimensions.
  Our method achieves a maximum speedup of \textbf{36.75}$\times$ among all
operations over PyTorch kernels and delivers the highest speedup on \textbf{28}
(\textbf{56.0\%}) of 50 operations that achieve over \textbf{2$\times$}
acceleration.

TL;DR: 提出了MAGE框架，通过模型合并和引导解码两阶段方法解决多目标生成中的控制问题，相比现有方法具有更好的可控性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在可控多目标生成中存在不足：基于合并的方法提供间接的参数级控制，而基于解码的引导方法需要聚合多个专家模型的logits，空间开销大且依赖单个模型能力。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段动态构建更鲁棒的基模型，合并多个考虑多目标的骨干模型；第二阶段将显式和隐式价值模型合并为统一引导代理，指导基模型的解码过程。

Result: 实验验证了价值模型中的线性模式连通性，探索了模型合并与预测集成的关系，证明该方法在可控性、帕累托最优性能和适应性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGE框架通过模型合并和引导解码的结合，有效解决了多目标生成中的控制挑战，实现了更好的性能和可控性。

Abstract: Adapting to diverse user needs at test time is a key challenge in
controllable multi-objective generation. Existing methods are insufficient:
merging-based approaches provide indirect, suboptimal control at the parameter
level, often disregarding the impacts of multiple objectives. While
decoding-based guidance is more direct, it typically requires aggregating
logits from multiple expert models, incurring significant space overhead and
relying heavily on individual model capacity. To address these issues, we
introduce Merge-And-GuidE (MAGE), a two-stage framework that leverages model
merging for guided decoding. We first identify a critical compatibility problem
between the guidance and base models. In Stage 1, MAGE resolves this by
dynamically constructing a more robust base model, merging a series of backbone
models that account for multiple objectives. In Stage 2, we merge explicit and
implicit value models into a unified guidance proxy, which then steers the
decoding of the base model from Stage 1. Our analysis empirically validates
Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) in value models, explores the relationship
between model merging and prediction ensembling, and demonstrates the enhanced
controllability afforded by our approach. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior controllability,
Pareto-optimal performance, and enhanced adaptability.

TL;DR: 本文从理论角度分析了Transformer模型参数分配策略，发现注意力头和头维度在不同层间的最优分配方式，揭示了softmax激活函数的饱和现象，并提出了基于理论指导的参数分配原则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在各种应用中取得了显著成功，但其模型效率的理论基础仍未充分探索。本文旨在研究在固定参数预算下，如何在不同层间分配注意力头和头维度来平衡表达能力和效率。

Method: 首先从近似角度对早期层在信息提取中的作用进行数学分析，理论刻画了在固定参数预算下注意力头数量和头维度之间的权衡关系。同时发现并证明了softmax激活函数的饱和行为：持续增加头维度会导致学习误差的收益递减，特别是对于长序列。

Result: 理论和实验都支持softmax的饱和模式，表明后续层可以用更少的参数更高效地运行。基于这些发现，提出了在Transformer各层间分配注意力头和维度的原则性策略。

Conclusion: 本文为Transformer架构的模型效率提供了理论基础，揭示了参数分配的关键见解，有助于设计更高效的Transformer模型。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable successes across a wide range of
applications, yet the theoretical foundation of their model efficiency remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate how the model parameters -- mainly
attention heads and head dimensions -- should be allocated across layers to
balance expressivity and efficiency. We first provide mathematical analysis on
the role of early layers in information extraction from an approximation
perspective, with a theoretical characterization on the trade-off between the
number of heads and head dimension under a fixed parameter budget. In addition,
we uncover and prove the \emph{saturation} behavior of softmax activations:
Continuously increasing head dimensions can lead to diminishing returns in
learning errors, particularly for long sequences. Supported by both theory and
experiments, this saturation pattern suggests that later layers can operate
more efficiently with reduced parameters. Combining these insights, we propose
principled strategies for allocating attention heads and dimensions across
Transformers' layers, shedding light on theoretically-grounded model efficiency
of Transformer-based architectures.

Motivation: 现有研究主要假设轻尾奖励分布，但许多现实场景（如临床试验结果）具有重尾特征，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出了针对重尾奖励的鲁棒批处理老虎机算法，涵盖有限臂和Lipschitz连续设置。

Result: 发现重尾奖励在实例无关和Lipschitz设置中需要更少的批次达到近似最优遗憾，而在实例相关设置中批次需求不变。

Conclusion: 重尾奖励对批处理需求的影响因设置而异，为实际应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: The batched multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, in which rewards are collected
in batches, is crucial for applications such as clinical trials. Existing
research predominantly assumes light-tailed reward distributions, yet many
real-world scenarios, including clinical outcomes, exhibit heavy-tailed
characteristics. This paper bridges this gap by proposing robust batched bandit
algorithms designed for heavy-tailed rewards, within both finite-arm and
Lipschitz-continuous settings. We reveal a surprising phenomenon: in the
instance-independent regime, as well as in the Lipschitz setting,
heavier-tailed rewards necessitate a smaller number of batches to achieve
near-optimal regret. In stark contrast, for the instance-dependent setting, the
required number of batches to attain near-optimal regret remains invariant with
respect to tail heaviness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: mRNA序列设计面临巨大组合空间和多个序列属性优化的挑战，而生成流网络的训练受到稀疏、长视野奖励和多目标权衡的阻碍。

Method: CAGFN整合基于长度的课程学习，逐步调整最大序列长度，从简单到复杂的子问题引导探索，并提供了新的mRNA设计环境。

Result: 在不同mRNA设计任务中，CAGFN提高了Pareto性能和生物学合理性，同时保持多样性，比随机序列采样的GFlowNet更快达到更高质量的解决方案，并能泛化到分布外序列。

Conclusion: CAGFN为治疗性序列设计中应用和推进GFlowNets提供了生物学动机的设置，在mRNA序列生成方面表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Designing mRNA sequences is a major challenge in developing next-generation
therapeutics, since it involves exploring a vast space of possible nucleotide
combinations while optimizing sequence properties like stability, translation
efficiency, and protein expression. While Generative Flow Networks are
promising for this task, their training is hindered by sparse, long-horizon
rewards and multi-objective trade-offs. We propose Curriculum-Augmented
GFlowNets (CAGFN), which integrate curriculum learning with multi-objective
GFlowNets to generate de novo mRNA sequences. CAGFN integrates a length-based
curriculum that progressively adapts the maximum sequence length guiding
exploration from easier to harder subproblems. We also provide a new mRNA
design environment for GFlowNets which, given a target protein sequence and a
combination of biological objectives, allows for the training of models that
generate plausible mRNA candidates. This provides a biologically motivated
setting for applying and advancing GFlowNets in therapeutic sequence design. On
different mRNA design tasks, CAGFN improves Pareto performance and biological
plausibility, while maintaining diversity. Moreover, CAGFN reaches
higher-quality solutions faster than a GFlowNet trained with random sequence
sampling (no curriculum), and enables generalization to out-of-distribution
sequences.

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have found widespread applications in
machine learning for time series prediction and dynamical systems
reconstruction, and experienced a recent renaissance with improved training
algorithms and architectural designs. Understanding why and how trained RNNs
produce their behavior is important for scientific and medical applications,
and explainable AI more generally. An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the
topological and geometrical properties of its state space. Stable and unstable
manifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a
dynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their
intersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce
a novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on
piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as
their activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to
trace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to
characterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further
show its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections
between stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of
chaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological
recordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics
could be gained through our method.

TL;DR: 本文提出TROLL方法，用离散可微信任区域投影替代PPO中的clip机制，为大型语言模型提供原则性的token级KL约束，在训练速度、稳定性和最终成功率方面均优于PPO-like剪裁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO-like剪裁机制作为KL信任区域的粗糙近似，常导致不稳定更新和次优性能，需要更原则性的信任区域约束方法。

Method: 提出离散可微信任区域投影，在模型最重要的token logits稀疏子集上操作，平衡计算成本和投影效果，直接替代PPO剪裁。

Result: 在不同数据集、模型家族和优势估计方法上，TROLL在训练速度、稳定性和最终成功率方面一致优于PPO-like剪裁。

Conclusion: TROLL作为PPO-like剪裁的直接替代方案，提供了更原则性的信任区域优化方法，且不改变模型推理行为。

Abstract: On-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) with PPO-like clip objectives has
become the standard choice for reward-based fine-tuning of large language
models (LLMs). Although recent work has explored improved estimators of
advantages and normalization, the clipping mechanism itself has remained
untouched. Originally introduced as a proxy for principled KL-based trust
regions, clipping is a crude approximation that often causes unstable updates
and suboptimal performance. We replace the clip objective with a novel discrete
differentiable trust region projection, which provides principled token-level
KL constraints. The projection operates on a sparse subset of the model's most
important token logits to balance computational cost and projection
effectiveness. Our approach, Trust Region Optimization for Large Language
Models (TROLL), serves as a direct replacement for PPO-like clipping during
training and does not alter the model's inference behavior. Across datasets,
model families, and advantage-estimation methods, TROLL consistently
outperforms PPO-like clipping in terms of training speed, stability, and final
success rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高空气球多智能体协调方法主要使用确定性方法（如Voronoi分区和极值搜索控制），这些方法在大规模全局星座中表现良好，但在小团队和局部任务中性能较差。虽然已有单智能体强化学习应用于高空气球控制的研究，但协调多智能体强化学习尚未被探索。

Method: 扩展了先前开发的强化学习模拟环境（RLHAB）以支持协作多智能体学习，采用QMIX算法进行集中训练分散执行，使用包含个体状态、环境上下文和队友数据的专门观测空间，以及优先考虑覆盖范围同时鼓励空间分布的层次化奖励机制。

Result: QMIX在分布式区域覆盖任务中实现了与理论最优几何确定性方法相似的性能，验证了多智能体强化学习方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为更复杂的自主多高空气球任务奠定了基础，特别是在确定性方法变得难以处理的情况下，多智能体强化学习方法显示出良好的应用前景。

Abstract: High Altitude Balloons (HABs) can leverage stratospheric wind layers for
limited horizontal control, enabling applications in reconnaissance,
environmental monitoring, and communications networks. Existing multi-agent HAB
coordination approaches use deterministic methods like Voronoi partitioning and
extremum seeking control for large global constellations, which perform poorly
for smaller teams and localized missions. While single-agent HAB control using
reinforcement learning has been demonstrated on HABs, coordinated multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) has not yet been investigated. This work presents
the first systematic application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
to HAB coordination for distributed area coverage. We extend our previously
developed reinforcement learning simulation environment (RLHAB) to support
cooperative multi-agent learning, enabling multiple agents to operate
simultaneously in realistic atmospheric conditions. We adapt QMIX for HAB area
coverage coordination, leveraging Centralized Training with Decentralized
Execution to address atmospheric vehicle coordination challenges. Our approach
employs specialized observation spaces providing individual state,
environmental context, and teammate data, with hierarchical rewards
prioritizing coverage while encouraging spatial distribution. We demonstrate
that QMIX achieves similar performance to the theoretically optimal geometric
deterministic method for distributed area coverage, validating the MARL
approach and providing a foundation for more complex autonomous multi-HAB
missions where deterministic methods become intractable.

Conclusion: PDNS框架能够有效解决多模态分布采样中的模式崩溃问题，通过渐进式路径构建实现全面的模式探索

Abstract: The task of learning a diffusion-based neural sampler for drawing samples
from an unnormalized target distribution can be viewed as a stochastic optimal
control problem on path measures. However, the training of neural samplers can
be challenging when the target distribution is multimodal with significant
barriers separating the modes, potentially leading to mode collapse. We propose
a framework named \textbf{Proximal Diffusion Neural Sampler (PDNS)} that
addresses these challenges by tackling the stochastic optimal control problem
via proximal point method on the space of path measures. PDNS decomposes the
learning process into a series of simpler subproblems that create a path
gradually approaching the desired distribution. This staged procedure traces a
progressively refined path to the desired distribution and promotes thorough
exploration across modes. For a practical and efficient realization, we
instantiate each proximal step with a proximal weighted denoising cross-entropy
(WDCE) objective. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PDNS
through extensive experiments on both continuous and discrete sampling tasks,
including challenging scenarios in molecular dynamics and statistical physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着经验操作员逐渐退休，工厂缺乏执行启动和等级转换所需的隐性知识，而标准离线强化学习在策略超出数据范围时存在分布偏移和价值高估问题。

Method: 离线阶段学习数据流形和长时域Q批评器，在线阶段求解单步优化问题，最大化Q值同时惩罚偏离学习流形和操纵变量过大变化率。

Result: 在聚合反应器启动和造纸机等级转换两个工业案例中，HOFLON不仅优于IQL算法，而且平均累积奖励超过了历史数据中观察到的最佳启动或等级转换。

Conclusion: HOFLON展示了超越当前专家能力的自动化转换操作潜力，能够从历史数据中学习并改进操作策略。

Abstract: Start-ups and product grade-changes are critical steps in continuous-process
plant operation, because any misstep immediately affects product quality and
drives operational losses. These transitions have long relied on manual
operation by a handful of expert operators, but the progressive retirement of
that workforce is leaving plant owners without the tacit know-how needed to
execute them consistently. In the absence of a process model, offline
reinforcement learning (RL) promises to capture and even surpass human
expertise by mining historical start-up and grade-change logs, yet standard
offline RL struggles with distribution shift and value-overestimation whenever
a learned policy ventures outside the data envelope. We introduce HOFLON
(Hybrid Offline Learning + Online Optimization) to overcome those limitations.
Offline, HOFLON learns (i) a latent data manifold that represents the feasible
region spanned by past transitions and (ii) a long-horizon Q-critic that
predicts the cumulative reward from state-action pairs. Online, it solves a
one-step optimization problem that maximizes the Q-critic while penalizing
deviations from the learned manifold and excessive rates of change in the
manipulated variables. We test HOFLON on two industrial case studies: a
polymerization reactor start-up and a paper-machine grade-change problem, and
benchmark it against Implicit Q-Learning (IQL), a leading offline-RL algorithm.
In both plants HOFLON not only surpasses IQL but also delivers, on average,
better cumulative rewards than the best start-up or grade-change observed in
the historical data, demonstrating its potential to automate transition
operations beyond current expert capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当训练数据在批次间或地理位置上碎片化时，训练模型会出现性能下降，这主要由于协变量偏移导致各片段分布与假设的未碎片化训练分布不同。

Method: FIRE方法通过近似费舍尔信息累积碎片化引起的协变量偏移差异，将其作为每个片段的损失惩罚项，实现分布对齐。

Result: FIRE在偏移验证集上最大优于重要性加权基准5.1%，优于联邦学习基准最多5.3%。

Conclusion: FIRE方法能有效处理碎片化数据引起的协变量偏移问题，提升模型在偏移验证集上的性能。

Abstract: When training data are fragmented across batches or federated-learned across
different geographic locations, trained models manifest performance
degradation. That degradation partly owes to covariate shift induced by data
having been fragmented across time and space and producing dissimilar empirical
training distributions. Each fragment's distribution is slightly different to a
hypothetical unfragmented training distribution of covariates, and to the
single validation distribution. To address this problem, we propose Fisher
Information for Robust fEderated validation (\textbf{FIRE}). This method
accumulates fragmentation-induced covariate shift divergences from the global
training distribution via an approximate Fisher information. That term, which
we prove to be a more computationally-tractable estimate, is then used as a
per-fragment loss penalty, enabling scalable distribution alignment. FIRE
outperforms importance weighting benchmarks by $5.1\%$ at maximum and federated
learning (FL) benchmarks by up to $5.3\%$ on shifted validation sets.

control, ensuring statistical validity at any stopping time. Under sustained
shifts, we further bound the expected detection delay as
$\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\delta)/\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ reflects the post-shift
information gain, thereby linking detection efficiency to distributional
divergence. For adaptation, we show that Fisher-preconditioned updates of
prompt parameters implement natural gradient descent on the distributional
manifold, yielding locally optimal updates that minimize KL divergence while
preserving stability and parameterization invariance. Together, these results
establish M-FISHER as a principled approach for robust, anytime-valid detection
and geometrically stable adaptation in sequential decision-making under
covariate shift.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于ICD-10代码的算法，利用大型语言模型增强的临床路线图来恢复电子健康记录中的缺失数据，性能与专家图表审查相当但更具扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录数据存在缺失和错误问题，传统图表审查成本高且耗时，限制了可审查的患者数量，需要更高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用迭代改进的临床路线图（结合大型语言模型和临床专业知识扩展辅助诊断列表），开发基于ICD-10代码的算法来模拟专家图表审查并恢复缺失值。

Result: 算法恢复的缺失数据量与专家图表审查相当甚至更多，取决于使用的路线图版本，在1000名患者的大规模研究中验证了可行性。

Conclusion: 临床驱动算法（通过LLM增强）能够以与图表审查相似的准确性恢复缺失的EHR数据，并可扩展到大规模样本，未来有望扩展到监测数据质量的其他维度。

Abstract: Objective: Electronic health records (EHR) data are prone to missingness and
errors. Previously, we devised an "enriched" chart review protocol where a
"roadmap" of auxiliary diagnoses (anchors) was used to recover missing values
in EHR data (e.g., a diagnosis of impaired glycemic control might imply that a
missing hemoglobin A1c value would be considered unhealthy). Still, chart
reviews are expensive and time-intensive, which limits the number of patients
whose data can be reviewed. Now, we investigate the accuracy and scalability of
a roadmap-driven algorithm, based on ICD-10 codes (International Classification
of Diseases, 10th revision), to mimic expert chart reviews and recover missing
values. Materials and Methods: In addition to the clinicians' original roadmap
from our previous work, we consider new versions that were iteratively refined
using large language models (LLM) in conjunction with clinical expertise to
expand the list of auxiliary diagnoses. Using chart reviews for 100 patients
from the EHR at an extensive learning health system, we examine algorithm
performance with different roadmaps. Using the larger study of $1000$ patients,
we applied the final algorithm, which used a roadmap with clinician-approved
additions from the LLM. Results: The algorithm recovered as much, if not more,
missing data as the expert chart reviewers, depending on the roadmap.
Discussion: Clinically-driven algorithms (enhanced by LLM) can recover missing
EHR data with similar accuracy to chart reviews and can feasibly be applied to
large samples. Extending them to monitor other dimensions of data quality
(e.g., plausability) is a promising future direction.

TL;DR: 提出RAPO算法解决RLVR训练中反向KL散度导致探索受限的问题，通过前向KL惩罚和自适应重加权促进更广泛的探索，在数学推理任务上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在增加采样预算时优势减弱，因为反向KL散度的模式寻求行为限制了策略在基础模型支持区域外的探索。

Method: 使用前向KL惩罚替代反向KL惩罚进行分布外探索，并对参考策略进行重加权实现自适应分布内探索。

Result: 在AIME2024和AIME2025评估中，RAPO持续提升问题解决性能，突破基础模型性能上限，解决先前难以处理的问题。

Conclusion: RAPO通过改进探索策略推动了RLVR在挑战性推理任务中的前沿发展。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently enhanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for
mathematical problem solving. However, a fundamental limitation remains: as the
sampling budget increases, the advantage of RLVR-trained models over their
pretrained bases often diminishes or even vanishes, revealing a strong
dependence on the base model's restricted search space. We attribute this
phenomenon to the widespread use of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence regularizer, whose mode-seeking behavior keeps the policy trapped
inside the base model's support region and hampers wider exploration. To
address this issue, we propose RAPO (Rewards-Aware Policy Optimization), an
algorithm to promote broader yet focused exploration. Our method (i) utilizes
the forward KL penalty to replace the reverse KL penalty for
out-of-distribution exploration, and (ii) reweights the reference policy to
facilitate adaptive in-distribution exploration. We train Qwen2.5-3B and 7B
models with RAPO on the 8K SimpleRL-Zero dataset, without supervised
fine-tuning, and evaluate them on AIME2024 and AIME2025. Results show that RAPO
consistently improves problem-solving performance. Notably, RAPO enables models
to surpass the base model's performance ceiling and solves previously
intractable problems, advancing the frontier of RLVR for challenging reasoning
tasks.

Motivation: Muon优化器在多种应用中表现出色，但其在联邦学习中的有效性尚未被探索，因此需要研究Muon在联邦学习环境下的性能。

Method: 提出了FedMuon算法，建立了其在非凸问题中的收敛率，并进行了理论分析，发现其具有正交化更新方向等有利特性。

Result: 理论分析表明FedMuon的学习率独立于问题特定参数，并能自然适应重尾噪声。多种神经网络架构上的广泛实验验证了该算法的有效性。

Conclusion: FedMuon算法在联邦学习环境中表现出色，具有理论保证和实际有效性，为Muon优化器在分布式学习中的应用提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: The recently introduced optimizer, Muon, has gained increasing attention due
to its superior performance across a wide range of applications. However, its
effectiveness in federated learning remains unexplored. To address this gap,
this paper investigates the performance of Muon in the federated learning
setting. Specifically, we propose a new algorithm, FedMuon, and establish its
convergence rate for nonconvex problems. Our theoretical analysis reveals
multiple favorable properties of FedMuon. In particular, due to its
orthonormalized update direction, the learning rate of FedMuon is independent
of problem-specific parameters, and, importantly, it can naturally accommodate
heavy-tailed noise. The extensive experiments on a variety of neural network
architectures validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: 研究发现模型和数据集联合最优缩放由输出层算子范数这一单一不变量决定，称为范数转移现象。在1.3B参数模型和138B tokens数据集上，最优学习率/批次大小组合具有相同的算子范数值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在模型和数据集缩放下的最优超参数转移方面已有进展，但缺乏统一解释原则。本研究旨在发现支配联合最优缩放的基本规律。

Method: 使用Scion优化器，在不同规模模型和数据集上测量最优学习率和批次大小组合，分析输出层算子范数的变化规律，并验证范数转移现象。

Result: 发现最优学习率/批次大小组合具有恒定的算子范数值，这是必要但不充分条件。提供了Scion优化器随数据集大小的最优参数缩放规则，与Adam优化器一致。分层组学习率调优可提升性能。

Conclusion: 输出层算子范数是模型和数据集联合最优缩放的关键不变量。范数指导的最优缩放方法为大规模LLM训练提供了实用指导，并发布了分布式Scion实现和运行日志。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in optimal hyperparameter transfer under model and
dataset scaling, no unifying explanatory principle has been established. Using
the Scion optimizer, we discover that joint optimal scaling across model and
dataset sizes is governed by a single invariant: the operator norm of the
output layer. Across models with up to 1.3B parameters trained on up to 138B
tokens, the optimal learning rate/batch size pair $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$
consistently has the same operator norm value - a phenomenon we term norm
transfer. This constant norm condition is necessary but not sufficient: while
for each dataset size, multiple $(\eta, B)$ reach the optimal norm, only a
unique $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ achieves the best loss. As a sufficient
condition, we provide the first measurement of $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$
scaling with dataset size for Scion, and find that the scaling rules are
consistent with those of the Adam optimizer. Tuning per-layer-group learning
rates also improves model performance, with the output layer being the most
sensitive and hidden layers benefiting from lower learning rates. We provide
practical insights on norm-guided optimal scaling and release our Distributed
Scion (Disco) implementation with logs from over two thousand runs to support
research on LLM training dynamics at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒优化方法需要已知问题结构，限制了在高保真仿真环境中的应用；现有鲁棒贝叶斯优化方法忽略结构信息且难以扩展到高维场景

Method: 将目标函数表示为有向图结构，包含白盒和黑盒组件；提出基于Thompson采样的可扩展采集函数，使用梯度方法高效优化

Result: 在合成和实际案例研究中，相比现有仿真鲁棒优化算法，BONSAI能提供更样本高效和更高质量的鲁棒解

Conclusion: BONSAI在复杂工程系统的不确定性感知设计中具有实际优势，特别适用于过程系统工程应用

Abstract: Optimal design under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge in advancing
reliable, next-generation process systems. Robust optimization (RO) offers a
principled approach by safeguarding against worst-case scenarios across a range
of uncertain parameters. However, traditional RO methods typically require
known problem structure, which limits their applicability to high-fidelity
simulation environments. To overcome these limitations, recent work has
explored robust Bayesian optimization (RBO) as a flexible alternative that can
accommodate expensive, black-box objectives. Existing RBO methods, however,
generally ignore available structural information and struggle to scale to
high-dimensional settings. In this work, we introduce BONSAI (Bayesian
Optimization of Network Systems under uncertAInty), a new RBO framework that
leverages partial structural knowledge commonly available in simulation-based
models. Instead of treating the objective as a monolithic black box, BONSAI
represents it as a directed graph of interconnected white- and black-box
components, allowing the algorithm to utilize intermediate information within
the optimization process. We further propose a scalable Thompson sampling-based
acquisition function tailored to the structured RO setting, which can be
efficiently optimized using gradient-based methods. We evaluate BONSAI across a
diverse set of synthetic and real-world case studies, including applications in
process systems engineering. Compared to existing simulation-based RO
algorithms, BONSAI consistently delivers more sample-efficient and
higher-quality robust solutions, highlighting its practical advantages for
uncertainty-aware design in complex engineering systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-DAS是一个新颖的框架，将大语言模型从"数据处理者"重新定位为"算法专家"，通过分析检测器的内在弱点生成难以检测的异常数据，从而增强检测器的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的表格异常检测方法依赖对异常模式的假设，在真实场景中表现不一致。直接应用大语言模型面临异构数据处理困难和隐私风险等挑战。

Method: 利用LLM的推理能力分析检测器的高层描述，理解其内在弱点，然后生成检测器特定、数据无关的Python代码来合成"难以检测"的异常，通过程序化合成增强训练数据。

Result: 在36个TAD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LLM-DAS能够持续提升主流检测器的性能。

Conclusion: LLM-DAS通过程序化合成将LLM推理与经典异常检测算法相结合，提供了一种可扩展、有效且保护隐私的方法来修补现有检测器的逻辑盲点。

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods for tabular data usually rely on some
assumptions about anomaly patterns, leading to inconsistent performance in
real-world scenarios. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable
reasoning capabilities, their direct application to tabular AD is impeded by
fundamental challenges, including difficulties in processing heterogeneous data
and significant privacy risks. To address these limitations, we propose
LLM-DAS, a novel framework that repositions the LLM from a ``data processor''
to an ``algorithmist''. Instead of being exposed to raw data, our framework
leverages the LLM's ability to reason about algorithms. It analyzes a
high-level description of a given detector to understand its intrinsic
weaknesses and then generates detector-specific, data-agnostic Python code to
synthesize ``hard-to-detect'' anomalies that exploit these vulnerabilities.
This generated synthesis program, which is reusable across diverse datasets, is
then instantiated to augment training data, systematically enhancing the
detector's robustness by transforming the problem into a more discriminative
two-class classification task. Extensive experiments on 36 TAD benchmarks show
that LLM-DAS consistently boosts the performance of mainstream detectors. By
bridging LLM reasoning with classic AD algorithms via programmatic synthesis,
LLM-DAS offers a scalable, effective, and privacy-preserving approach to
patching the logical blind spots of existing detectors.

Conclusion: 论文主张使用基础模型的预训练表示来进行高效且适应性强的时间序列异常检测。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection forms a very crucial area in several domains
but poses substantial challenges. Due to time series data possessing
seasonality, trends, noise, and evolving patterns (concept drift), it becomes
very difficult to set a general notion of what constitutes normal behavior.
Anomalies themselves could be varied, ranging from a single outlier to
contextual or collective anomalies, and are normally very rare; hence, the
dataset is largely imbalanced. Additional layers of complexities arise due to
the problems of increased dimensionality of modern time series, real-time
detection criteria, setting up appropriate detection thresholds, and arriving
at results that are interpretable. To embrace these multifaceted challenges,
very strong, flexible, and interpretable approaches are required. This paper
presents THEMIS, a new framework for time series anomaly detection that
exploits pretrained knowledge from foundation models. THEMIS extracts
embeddings from the encoder of the Chronos time series foundation model and
applies outlier detection techniques like Local Outlier Factor and Spectral
Decomposition on the self-similarity matrix, to spot anomalies in the data. Our
experiments show that this modular method achieves SOTA results on the MSL
dataset and performs quite competitively on the SMAP and SWAT$^*$ datasets.
Notably, THEMIS exceeds models trained specifically for anomaly detection,
presenting hyperparameter robustness and interpretability by default. This
paper advocates for pretrained representations from foundation models for
performing efficient and adaptable anomaly detection for time series data.

Conclusion: 广义FQI能有效处理聚类数据，在医疗健康应用中显著提升强化学习性能。

Abstract: This paper focuses on reinforcement learning (RL) with clustered data, which
is commonly encountered in healthcare applications. We propose a generalized
fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithm that incorporates generalized estimating
equations into policy learning to handle the intra-cluster correlations.
Theoretically, we demonstrate (i) the optimalities of our Q-function and policy
estimators when the correlation structure is correctly specified, and (ii)
their consistencies when the structure is mis-specified. Empirically, through
simulations and analyses of a mobile health dataset, we find the proposed
generalized FQI achieves, on average, a half reduction in regret compared to
the standard FQI.

Abstract: Motivated by the predictable nature of real-life in data streams, we study
online regression when the learner has access to predictions about future
examples. In the extreme case, called transductive online learning, the
sequence of examples is revealed to the learner before the game begins. For
this setting, we fully characterize the minimax expected regret in terms of the
fat-shattering dimension, establishing a separation between transductive online
regression and (adversarial) online regression. Then, we generalize this
setting by allowing for noisy or \emph{imperfect} predictions about future
examples. Using our results for the transductive online setting, we develop an
online learner whose minimax expected regret matches the worst-case regret,
improves smoothly with prediction quality, and significantly outperforms the
worst-case regret when future example predictions are precise, achieving
performance similar to the transductive online learner. This enables
learnability for previously unlearnable classes under predictable examples,
aligning with the broader learning-augmented model paradigm.

Abstract: Continuous-depth graph neural networks, also known as Graph Neural
Differential Equations (GNDEs), combine the structural inductive bias of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) with the continuous-depth architecture of Neural ODEs,
offering a scalable and principled framework for modeling dynamics on graphs.
In this paper, we present a rigorous convergence analysis of GNDEs with
time-varying parameters in the infinite-node limit, providing theoretical
insights into their size transferability. To this end, we introduce Graphon
Neural Differential Equations (Graphon-NDEs) as the infinite-node limit of
GNDEs and establish their well-posedness. Leveraging tools from graphon theory
and dynamical systems, we prove the trajectory-wise convergence of GNDE
solutions to Graphon-NDE solutions. Moreover, we derive explicit convergence
rates under two deterministic graph sampling regimes: (1) weighted graphs
sampled from smooth graphons, and (2) unweighted graphs sampled from
$\{0,1\}$-valued (discontinuous) graphons. We further establish size
transferability bounds, providing theoretical justification for the practical
strategy of transferring GNDE models trained on moderate-sized graphs to
larger, structurally similar graphs without retraining. Numerical experiments
using synthetic and real data support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Multi-LLM collaboration promises accurate, robust, and context-aware
solutions, yet existing approaches rely on implicit selection and output
assessment without analyzing whether collaborating models truly complement or
conflict. We introduce LLM Chemistry -- a framework that measures when LLM
combinations exhibit synergistic or antagonistic behaviors that shape
collective performance beyond individual capabilities. We formalize the notion
of chemistry among LLMs, propose algorithms that quantify it by analyzing
interaction dependencies, and recommend optimal model ensembles accordingly.
Our theoretical analysis shows that chemistry among collaborating LLMs is most
evident under heterogeneous model profiles, with its outcome impact shaped by
task type, group size, and complexity. Evaluation on classification,
summarization, and program repair tasks provides initial evidence for these
task-dependent effects, thereby reinforcing our theoretical results. This
establishes LLM Chemistry as both a diagnostic factor in multi-LLM systems and
a foundation for ensemble recommendation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) raise concerns about content authenticity and
integrity because they can generate human-like text at scale. Text watermarks,
which embed detectable statistical signals into generated text, offer a
provable way to verify content origin. Many detection methods rely on pivotal
statistics that are i.i.d. under human-written text, making goodness-of-fit
(GoF) tests a natural tool for watermark detection. However, GoF tests remain
largely underexplored in this setting. In this paper, we systematically
evaluate eight GoF tests across three popular watermarking schemes, using three
open-source LLMs, two datasets, various generation temperatures, and multiple
post-editing methods. We find that general GoF tests can improve both the
detection power and robustness of watermark detectors. Notably, we observe that
text repetition, common in low-temperature settings, gives GoF tests a unique
advantage not exploited by existing methods. Our results highlight that classic
GoF tests are a simple yet powerful and underused tool for watermark detection
in LLMs.

Abstract: Data-centric learning seeks to improve model performance from the perspective
of data quality, and has been drawing increasing attention in the machine
learning community. Among its key tools, influence functions provide a powerful
framework to quantify the impact of individual training samples on model
predictions, enabling practitioners to identify detrimental samples and retrain
models on a cleaner dataset for improved performance. However, most existing
work focuses on the question: "what data benefits the learning model?" In this
paper, we take a step further and investigate a more fundamental question:
"what is the performance ceiling of the learning model?" Unlike prior studies
that primarily measure improvement through overall accuracy, we emphasize
category-wise accuracy and aim for Pareto improvements, ensuring that every
class benefits, rather than allowing tradeoffs where some classes improve at
the expense of others. To address this challenge, we propose category-wise
influence functions and introduce an influence vector that quantifies the
impact of each training sample across all categories. Leveraging these
influence vectors, we develop a principled criterion to determine whether a
model can still be improved, and further design a linear programming-based
sample reweighting framework to achieve Pareto performance improvements.
Through extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, vision, and text
benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating and
achieving a model's performance improvement across multiple categories of
interest.

Abstract: Accurate ground truth estimation in medical screening programs often relies
on coalitions of experts and peer second opinions. Algorithms that efficiently
aggregate noisy annotations can enhance screening workflows, particularly when
data arrive continuously and expert proficiency is initially unknown. However,
existing algorithms do not meet the requirements for seamless integration into
screening pipelines. We therefore propose an adaptive approach for real-time
annotation that (I) supports on-the-fly labeling of incoming data, (II)
operates without prior knowledge of medical experts or pre-labeled data, and
(III) dynamically queries additional experts based on the latent difficulty of
each instance. The method incrementally gathers expert opinions until a
confidence threshold is met, providing accurate labels with reduced annotation
overhead. We evaluate our approach on three multi-annotator classification

### [410] [Early-Warning of Thunderstorm-Driven Power Outages with a Two-Stage Machine Learning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03959)
*Iryna Stanishevska*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一个24-48小时雷暴停电早期预警模型，使用公开数据源和两阶段模型设计（逻辑门+LSTM回归器），在密歇根州夏季雷暴相关停电预测中表现优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷暴驱动的停电难以预测，因为大多数风暴不会造成损害，对流过程快速且混乱，可用的公共数据既嘈杂又不完整。

Method: 使用公开数据（EAGLE-I停电数据、METAR天气数据），通过参数特定克里金插值和目标过采样保留极端值，构建因果时空特征，采用两阶段模型设计（逻辑门+LSTM回归器）。

Result: 在测试样本中，两阶段模型在所有时间窗口检测到更多参考峰值（如±48小时记录3/4 vs 2/4），在峰值附近显示适度的振幅增益（±0-12小时cMASE降低2-3%）。

Conclusion: 尽管公开数据存在噪声，但特征驱动的流水线为雷暴停电提供了可操作的、以事件为重点的早期预警。

Abstract: Thunderstorm-driven outages are difficult to predict because most storms do
not cause damage, convective processes occur rapidly and chaotically, and the
available public data are both noisy and incomplete. We develop a 24-48 h
early-warning model for summer, thunderstorm-related outages in Michigan using
only open sources (EAGLE-I for ground truth; METAR for weather). We use the
publicly released EAGLE-I outage dataset (2014-2022), maintained by Oak Ridge
National Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. The pipeline preserves
convective micro-signals from a sparse station network via parameter-specific
kriging with hourly variograms and targeted overdrafting to retain extremes,
and builds causal spatio-temporal features (lags/rolling statistics; k-NN/IDW
spatial aggregates) capturing precursors of severe convection (moisture
advection, wind shifts, and pressure drops). The two-stage model design,
combining a logistic gate and an LSTM regressor, limits routine periods and
reduces noise exposure. The study uses event-centric metrics (cluster-based
hits/misses/false alarms) and peak-conditional MASE (cMASE) in +/-Delta-hour
windows around state-level peaks (>= 50,000), with uncertainty quantified by
hourly moving-block bootstrap.
  On the test sample, Two-Stage detects more reference peaks across all windows
(e.g., at +/-48 h it records 3/4 vs. 2/4; F1 66.7% vs. 57.1%) with one extra
false alarm. Near peaks, it shows modest amplitude gains (2-3% lower cMASE at
+/-0-12 h; bootstrap medians +9-13% at +/-6-12 h) but small losses at +/-36-48
h (~3-4%). Overall, errors are comparable to the one-step LSTM baseline. SHAP
analysis confirms moisture-advection and wind/gust precursors, underscoring the
value of the feature engineering. Despite open-data noise, the feature-driven
pipeline yields actionable, event-focused early warnings for thunderstorm
outages.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEAR是一种利用大语言模型进行时间序列异常检测的新方法，通过软提示和量化技术将时间序列数据转换为LLM可处理的输入，在保持LLM冻结的同时通过软提示适应时间序列任务。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以处理变长时间序列序列和基于上下文的异常，而大语言模型为时间序列异常检测提供了新的机会。

Result: 实验结果表明软提示有效提升了LLM在时间序列异常检测下游任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 软提示和量化技术能够有效利用LLM进行时间序列异常检测，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of fields,
such as healthcare and internet traffic monitoring. The emergence of large
language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for detecting anomalies in the
ubiquitous time series data. Traditional approaches struggle with
variable-length time series sequences and context-based anomalies. We propose
Soft Prompt Enhanced Anomaly Recognition (SPEAR), a novel approach to leverage
LLMs for anomaly detection with soft prompts and quantization. Our methodology
involves quantizing and transforming the time series data into input embeddings
and combining them with learnable soft prompt embeddings. These combined
embeddings are then fed into a frozen LLM. The soft prompts are updated
iteratively based on a cross-entropy loss, allowing the model to adapt to time
series anomaly detection. The use of soft prompts helps adapt LLMs effectively
to time series tasks, while quantization ensures optimal handling of sequences,
as LLMs are designed to handle discrete sequences. Our experimental results
demonstrate that soft prompts effectively increase LLMs' performance in
downstream tasks regarding time series anomaly detection.

Motivation: 研究基于结果的强化学习在大型语言模型复杂推理任务中的局限性，特别是当基础模型从未采样到正确解决方案时出现的零奖励障碍问题。

Method: 通过图搜索任务评估了包含密集奖励、多样性激励和改进信用分配等方法，并测试了在训练集中添加更容易样本的数据中心干预方法。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法都无法克服零奖励障碍，但简单的数据干预（添加容易样本）能够使模型最终解决原始困难任务，且无需修改RL算法本身。

Conclusion: 数据中心的干预方法比算法改进更有效地解决了零奖励障碍问题，为RL在复杂推理任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome-based rewards has proven effective
for improving large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
its success often depends on the base model occasionally sampling correct
solutions. When no correct solutions are sampled, training encounters a
zero-reward barrier where learning stalls due to zero gradients. We study this
scenario through the graph search task introduced in Bachmann et al. (2024) and
evaluate recent methods that incorporate desirable components such as dense
rewards, diversity incentives, and improved credit assignment. Our experiments
show that none of these approaches overcome the zero-reward barrier if the base
model never produces a correct answer. In contrast, we find that a simple
data-centric intervention of adding easier samples to the training set enables
the model to eventually solve the original hard task despite starting from zero
reward. Importantly, this succeeds without modifying the RL algorithm itself.
Because official implementations of several baselines were unavailable, we
developed our own, which allowed us to conduct a detailed analysis of their
failure modes. We release these implementations to support further research at:

Conclusion: ICEPool通过强调簇间连接性的整合，能够产生更全面和鲁棒的图级表示

Abstract: Hierarchical Pooling Models have demonstrated strong performance in
classifying graph-structured data. While numerous innovative methods have been
proposed to design cluster assignments and coarsening strategies, the
relationships between clusters are often overlooked. In this paper, we
introduce Inter-cluster Connectivity Enhancement Pooling (ICEPool), a novel
hierarchical pooling framework designed to enhance model's understanding of
inter-cluster connectivity and ability of preserving the structural integrity
in the original graph. ICEPool is compatible with a wide range of pooling-based
GNN models. The deployment of ICEPool as an enhancement to existing models
effectively combines the strengths of the original model with ICEPool's
capability to emphasize the integration of inter-cluster connectivity,
resulting in a more comprehensive and robust graph-level representation.
Moreover, we make theoretical analysis to ICEPool's ability of graph
reconstruction to demonstrate its effectiveness in learning inter-cluster
relationship that is overlooked by conventional models. Finally, the
experimental results show the compatibility of ICEPool with wide varieties of
models and its potential to boost the performance of existing graph neural
network architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在多教师设置下如何为推理蒸馏选择最佳响应，提出了局部自然度方法来解决全局自然度在多教师场景下失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在单教师设置下通过选择学生模型赋予最高全局对数概率的响应来工作，但在多教师设置下，当响应来自多个教师时，全局自然度与下游性能不再相关，特别是当强教师的推理轨迹变长时。

Method: 提出了局部自然度方法，通过测量学生在短序列推理步骤上的对数概率（仅基于小局部窗口条件）来评估响应质量。该方法支持教师选择和响应选择两个应用。

Result: 局部自然度在数学基准测试上使32B学生模型的准确率比全局选择提高了9.4个百分点，并且超过了使用单个最佳教师数据训练的性能。

Conclusion: 局部数据质量评估和数据混合对于更有效的推理蒸馏具有强大作用，局部自然度方法在多教师设置下显著优于传统全局选择方法。

Abstract: Distilling long reasoning traces (10K+ tokens) from stronger teacher models
into smaller student LLMs via SFT has emerged as a standard paradigm. This
approach is practical and efficient: it leverages the ease of generating
abundant reasoning data from stronger models and provides a direct, data-driven
way to teach less capable models better reasoning. While previous work has
largely focused on prompt selection with responses from a single teacher, the
equally important problem of choosing the best response when multiple teacher
outputs are available for a single prompt remains underexplored. This challenge
becomes important in a multi-teacher setting, where different students may
benefit from the outputs of different teachers. This paper fills that gap with
a systematic study of response selection for reasoning distillation. We first
show that the current method, which picks responses the student assigns the
highest global log-probability (global naturalness), fails when responses come
from multiple teachers, i.e., global naturalness no longer correlates with
downstream performance, especially as the reasoning traces from strong teachers
become longer. To overcome this problem, we introduce Local Naturalness, which
measures the student's log-probabilities over short, sequential reasoning steps
conditioned only on a small local window. Local Naturalness enables two
applications: 1) Teacher Selection: Aggregating local scores across prompts
reliably identifies the most helpful teacher. 2) Response Selection from a
Multiple Teachers: When mixing answers from many teachers, Local Naturalness
boosts a 32B student's accuracy on math benchmarks by 9.4pp over global
selection, also surpassing the performance achieved by training on data from
the single best teacher. These results highlight the power of localized data
quality evaluation and data mixing for more effective reasoning distillation.

Conclusion: 这一新解释为深度学习架构与连续数学建模之间架起了桥梁，为可解释和理论基础的神经网络模型发展提供了基础视角。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of sequence
modeling and underpins the recent breakthroughs in large language models
(LLMs). However, a comprehensive mathematical theory that explains its
structure and operations remains elusive. In this work, we propose a novel
continuous framework that rigorously interprets the Transformer as a
discretization of a structured integro-differential equation. Within this
formulation, the self-attention mechanism emerges naturally as a non-local
integral operator, and layer normalization is characterized as a projection to
a time-dependent constraint. This operator-theoretic and variational
perspective offers a unified and interpretable foundation for understanding the
architecture's core components, including attention, feedforward layers, and
normalization. Our approach extends beyond previous theoretical analyses by
embedding the entire Transformer operation in continuous domains for both token
indices and feature dimensions. This leads to a principled and flexible
framework that not only deepens theoretical insight but also offers new
directions for architecture design, analysis, and control-based
interpretations. This new interpretation provides a step toward bridging the
gap between deep learning architectures and continuous mathematical modeling,
and contributes a foundational perspective to the ongoing development of
interpretable and theoretically grounded neural network models.

Method: 将模型训练重新解释为WC-4DVar问题，在自编码器学习的潜在空间中计算损失函数，避免在高维模型空间中显式建模再分析误差协方差。

Result: 在潜在空间中使用约束的滚动训练相比模型空间损失训练，提高了长期预报技能，更好地保持了精细尺度结构和物理真实性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个统一的理论框架，可以联合训练再分析和多源观测数据，改善机器学习天气预报的物理一致性和长期性能。

Abstract: Data-driven machine learning (ML) models have recently shown promise in
surpassing traditional physics-based approaches for weather forecasting,
leading to a so-called second revolution in weather forecasting. However, most
ML-based forecast models treat reanalysis as the truth and are trained under
variable-specific loss weighting, ignoring their physical coupling and spatial
structure. Over long time horizons, the forecasts become blurry and physically
unrealistic under rollout training. To address this, we reinterpret model
training as a weak-constraint four-dimensional variational data assimilation
(WC-4DVar) problem, treating reanalysis data as imperfect observations. This
allows the loss function to incorporate reanalysis error covariance and capture
multivariate dependencies. In practice, we compute the loss in a latent space
learned by an autoencoder (AE), where the reanalysis error covariance becomes
approximately diagonal, thus avoiding the need to explicitly model it in the
high-dimensional model space. We show that rollout training with latent-space
constraints improves long-term forecast skill and better preserves fine-scale
structures and physical realism compared to training with model-space loss.
Finally, we extend this framework to accommodate heterogeneous data sources,
enabling the forecast model to be trained jointly on reanalysis and
multi-source observations within a unified theoretical formulation.

TL;DR: RACE Attention是一种线性复杂度的注意力机制，替代二次复杂度的Softmax Attention，能在当前硬件上处理超长上下文窗口


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax Attention的二次时间复杂度在处理长上下文时变得不可行，即使使用优化的GPU内核也无法处理超过400万token的上下文

Method: 使用锐化的角度（余弦）相似度替代指数核，通过随机投影和软局部敏感哈希来近似注意力输出

Result: 在语言建模、掩码语言建模和文本分类任务中，RACE Attention在保持准确性的同时显著减少了运行时间和内存使用，在NVIDIA GH200 GPU上可处理1200万token，在Intel Xeon Gold 5220R CPU上可处理7500万token

Conclusion: RACE Attention为当前硬件上的超长上下文窗口提供了一个实用且理论基础的机制

Abstract: Softmax Attention has a quadratic time complexity, which becomes prohibitive
to run at long contexts, even with highly optimized GPU kernels. For example,
FlashAttention (an exact, GPU-optimized implementation of Softmax Attention)
cannot complete a single forward-backward pass of a multi-head attention layer
once the context exceeds ~4 million tokens on an NVIDIA GH200 (96 GB). We
introduce RACE Attention, a kernel-inspired alternative to Softmax Attention
that is linear in sequence length and embedding dimension. RACE Attention
replaces the exponential kernel with a sharpened angular (cosine) similarity,
and approximates attention outputs via randomized projections and soft
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Across language modeling, masked language
modeling, and text classification, RACE Attention matches the accuracy of
strong baselines while reducing runtime and memory. In a controlled scale test,
it processes up to 12 million tokens during a single forward-backward pass on
an NVIDIA GH200 GPU and 75 million tokens on an Intel Xeon Gold 5220R CPU, well
beyond the practical limits of the current state-of-the-art attention
implementations. RACE Attention thus offers a practical, theoretically grounded
mechanism for outrageously long context windows on today's hardware. We hope
that it gets adopted in practice.

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型尚未受益于现代后训练技术（如强化学习），传统LLM的算法与扩散框架不兼容，现有dLLM的RL方法缺乏理论基础。

Method: 提出了AGRPO算法，使用蒙特卡洛采样计算无偏策略梯度估计，是首个可处理、忠实适配dLLM的策略梯度方法。

Result: 在数学推理任务上取得显著提升：GSM8K任务绝对增益+7.6%，Countdown任务性能提升3.8倍，相比diffu-GRPO提升1.3倍，且在不同采样步数下保持性能优势。

Conclusion: 在线RL算法可以理论严谨且实际有效地扩展到扩散LLMs，实现计算与性能的更好权衡。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are a new paradigm of
non-autoregressive language models that are trained to predict multiple tokens
in parallel and generate text via iterative unmasking. Recent works have
successfully pretrained dLLMs to parity with autoregressive LLMs at the 8B
scale, but dLLMs have yet to benefit from modern post-training techniques, e.g.
reinforcement learning (RL), that have proven effective for autoregressive
models. Crucially, algorithms designed for traditional LLMs aren't directly
compatible with diffusion frameworks due to inherent differences in modeling
assumptions. Moreover, existing attempts at dLLM post-training with RL rely on
heuristic-based objectives with no theoretical grounding. In this work, we
present Amortized Group Relative Policy Optimization (AGRPO), a principled
on-policy RL algorithm designed specifically for dLLMs. AGRPO uses Monte Carlo
sampling to compute an unbiased policy gradient estimate, making it the first
tractable, faithful adaptation of policy gradient methods for dLLMs. We
demonstrate AGRPO's effectiveness on different math/reasoning tasks, a common
setting for RL with LLMs, achieving up to +7.6% absolute gain on GSM8K and 3.8x
performance on the Countdown task over the baseline LLaDA-8B-Instruct model and
1.3x performance gains over comparable RL methods such as diffu-GRPO.
Furthermore, these gains persist across different numbers of sampling steps at
inference time, achieving better tradeoffs between compute and performance. Our
results demonstrate that online RL algorithms can be extended to diffusion LLMs
in principled ways, maintaining both theoretical soundness and practical
effectiveness.

forecasting model acts as an agent, guided by a beam search-based planning
algorithm that leverages non-differentiable domain metrics as reward signals to
explore high-return future sequences. These identified high-reward candidates
then serve as pseudo-labels to continuously optimize the agent's policy through
iterative self-training, significantly reducing prediction error and
demonstrating exceptional performance on critical domain metrics like capturing
extreme events.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型对数据隐私保护需求的增加，差分隐私成为主要保护框架。传统多类SVM采用OvR/OvO方法会重复查询每个数据样本，导致隐私预算随类别数成比例消耗，限制了差分隐私在多类SVM中的应用。

Conclusion: PMSVM方法成功解决了差分隐私在多类SVM应用中的隐私预算浪费问题，为构建隐私保护的多类分类模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing need to safeguard data privacy in machine learning
models, differential privacy (DP) is one of the major frameworks to build
privacy-preserving models. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are widely used
traditional machine learning models due to their robust margin guarantees and
strong empirical performance in binary classification. However, applying DP to
multi-class SVMs is inadequate, as the standard one-versus-rest (OvR) and
one-versus-one (OvO) approaches repeatedly query each data sample when building
multiple binary classifiers, thus consuming the privacy budget proportionally
to the number of classes. To overcome this limitation, we explore all-in-one
SVM approaches for DP, which access each data sample only once to construct
multi-class SVM boundaries with margin maximization properties. We propose a
novel differentially Private Multi-class SVM (PMSVM) with weight and gradient
perturbation methods, providing rigorous sensitivity and convergence analyses
to ensure DP in all-in-one SVMs. Empirical results demonstrate that our
approach surpasses existing DP-SVM methods in multi-class scenarios.

Motivation: 为了解决关于RLVR是扩展还是收缩LLM推理能力边界的争议，研究旨在揭示训练过程中的概率质量动态机制。

Method: 采用理论和实证相结合的方法，分析RLVR训练中的两阶段概率质量动态：利用阶段和探索阶段。

Result: 发现利用阶段主要优化已知高奖励token，可能导致能力边界收缩；而探索阶段通过发现潜在最优token促进能力边界扩展。

Conclusion: RLVR对LLM推理能力的影响取决于训练阶段，过度利用会导致收缩，而持续训练到探索阶段则能扩展能力边界，为开发更先进推理能力提供理论基础。

Abstract: The ongoing debate on whether reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) expands or shrinks the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) remains unresolved. Some studies contend that RLVR mainly improves
sampling efficiency but at the expense of diversity and exploratory capacity,
resulting in capability boundary shrinkage. In contrast, others demonstrate
that prolonged training can lead to the emergence of novel reasoning
strategies, suggesting capability boundary expansion. To reconcile these
contradictory findings, we theoretically and empirically show that both
perspectives are partially valid-each aligning with a separate phase in an
inherent two-stage probability mass dynamic: (1) Exploitation stage: initially,
the model primarily samples explored high-reward and low-reward tokens, while
rarely selecting the potentially optimal token. Positive advantage estimates
increase the probability of high-reward tokens and decrease those of low-reward
tokens, yet the optimal token's probability remains largely unchanged during
this stage. (2) Exploration stage: as training advances, the growth rate of
previously acquired high-reward tokens slows as their probabilities approach
saturation. When a potentially optimal token-now receiving positive advantage
estimates-is occasionally sampled, its probability increases, while those of
the originally high-reward tokens decrease. This dynamic suggests that
over-exploitation during the exploitation stage may lead to capability boundary
shrinkage, whereas prolonged training into the exploration stage can promote an
expansion of the reasoning capability boundary. Building upon our insights, we
revisit the potential of only using relative negative gradients for prolonging
training, providing a theoretical and empirical foundation for the development
of more advanced reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: KOTARO是解决广泛不平衡分类问题的有前景方案，特别适用于严重不平衡场景

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in real-world binary classification
tasks, often leading to predictions biased toward the majority class and
reduced recognition of the minority class. This issue is particularly critical
in domains such as medical diagnosis and anomaly detection, where correct
classification of minority classes is essential. Conventional methods often
fail to deliver satisfactory performance when the imbalance ratio is extremely
severe. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called
Kernel-density-Oriented Threshold Adjustment with Regional Optimization
(KOTARO), which extends the framework of kernel density estimation (KDE) by
adaptively adjusting decision boundaries according to local sample density. In
KOTARO, the bandwidth of Gaussian basis functions is dynamically tuned based on
the estimated density around each sample, thereby enhancing the classifier's
ability to capture minority regions. We validated the effectiveness of KOTARO
through experiments on both synthetic and real-world imbalanced datasets. The
results demonstrated that KOTARO outperformed conventional methods,
particularly under conditions of severe imbalance, highlighting its potential
as a promising solution for a wide range of imbalanced classification problems

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为变分扩散遗忘(VDU)的方法，用于在数据受限环境下从预训练扩散模型中移除不良特征的生成能力，仅需访问包含不良特征的训练数据子集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了负责任地部署扩散模型，需要防止生成不良、暴力和淫秽内容。现有方法在数据受限（无法访问完整训练数据集）时效果不佳。

Method: 基于变分推断框架，使用包含两个项的损失函数：塑性诱导器（降低不良数据点的对数似然）和稳定性正则器（在参数空间正则化模型以防止图像生成质量下降）。

Result: 通过综合实验验证了方法在类别遗忘（从MNIST、CIFAR-10、tinyImageNet数据集移除特定类别）和特征遗忘（从Stable Diffusion模型移除高级特征）中的有效性。

Conclusion: VDU是一种计算高效的方法，能够在数据受限环境下有效防止扩散模型生成包含不良特征的输出，同时保持图像生成质量。

Abstract: For a responsible and safe deployment of diffusion models in various domains,
regulating the generated outputs from these models is desirable because such
models could generate undesired, violent, and obscene outputs. To tackle this
problem, recent works use machine unlearning methodology to forget training
data points containing these undesired features from pre-trained generative
models. However, these methods proved to be ineffective in data-constrained
settings where the whole training dataset is inaccessible. Thus, the principal
objective of this work is to propose a machine unlearning methodology that can
prevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a
pre-trained diffusion model in such a data-constrained setting. Our proposed
method, termed as Variational Diffusion Unlearning (VDU), is a computationally
efficient method that only requires access to a subset of training data
containing undesired features. Our approach is inspired by the variational
inference framework with the objective of minimizing a loss function consisting
of two terms: plasticity inducer and stability regularizer. Plasticity inducer
reduces the log-likelihood of the undesired training data points, while the
stability regularizer, essential for preventing loss of image generation
quality, regularizes the model in parameter space. We validate the
effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments for both class
unlearning and feature unlearning. For class unlearning, we unlearn some
user-identified classes from MNIST, CIFAR-10, and tinyImageNet datasets from a
pre-trained unconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM).
Similarly, for feature unlearning, we unlearn the generation of certain
high-level features from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model

### [425] [What Scales in Cross-Entropy Scaling Law?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04067)
*Junxi Yan,Zixi Wei,Jingtao Zhan,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文发现交叉熵缩放定律在超大规模下失效，原因是交叉熵本身并不真正缩放，只有其隐藏组件之一——错误熵遵循稳健的幂律缩放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交叉熵缩放定律长期以来指导大语言模型开发，但最近证据表明该定律在超大规模下失效，损失下降速度比预期慢，这给大模型开发带来显著困扰。

Method: 提出将交叉熵分解为三个部分：错误熵、自对齐和置信度，通过理论分析和在多个数据集及32个模型上的广泛实验验证这一分解。

Result: 只有错误熵遵循稳健的幂律缩放，而其他两个项基本保持不变；错误熵在小模型中占主导地位，但随着模型增大比例减小，这解释了交叉熵缩放定律在小规模下准确但在超大规模下失效的原因。

Conclusion: 建立了错误熵缩放定律作为模型行为的更准确描述，该发现将在大型语言模型的训练、理解和未来发展中有广泛应用。

Abstract: The cross-entropy scaling law has long served as a key tool for guiding the
development of large language models. It shows that cross-entropy loss
decreases in a predictable power-law rate as the model size increases. However,
recent evidence indicates that this law breaks down at very large scales: the
loss decreases more slowly than expected, which causes significant trouble for
developing large language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the root
cause lies in the fact that cross-entropy itself does not truly scale; instead,
only one of its hidden components does. To investigate this, we introduce a
novel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy,
Self-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that
this decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization
objectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models
spanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy
follows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely
invariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of
cross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow
larger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at
small scales but fails at very large ones. Our findings establish the
error-entropy scaling law as a more accurate description of model behavior. We
believe it will have wide applications in the training, understanding, and
future development of large language models.

TL;DR: SFPO是一个通过分解训练步骤为快速轨迹、重定位机制和慢速校正的三阶段框架，解决了强化学习中早期训练不稳定的问题，显著提升了推理任务的训练效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的策略优化方法（如GRPO）在早期训练中由于低质量轨迹产生的噪声梯度导致更新不稳定和探索效率低下，需要一种更稳定的训练框架。

Method: SFPO将每个训练步骤分解为三个阶段：在相同批次上进行短快速轨迹内步、控制离策略漂移的重定位机制、以及最终的慢速校正。这种重定位-更新设计保持目标和轨迹过程不变。

Result: SFPO在数学推理基准上比GRPO平均提升2.80分，减少4.93倍的轨迹采样次数，并将达到GRPO最佳准确率所需的挂钟时间减少4.19倍。

Conclusion: SFPO通过简单的三阶段分解框架，显著提升了强化学习在语言模型推理训练中的稳定性、效率和收敛速度，且与现有策略梯度流程完全兼容。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to enhancing reasoning in
large language models (LLMs). Yet on-policy algorithms such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer in early training: noisy gradients from
low-quality rollouts lead to unstable updates and inefficient exploration. We
introduce Slow-Fast Policy Optimization (SFPO), a simple yet efficient
framework to address these limitations via decomposing each step into three
stages: a short fast trajectory of inner steps on the same batch, a reposition
mechanism to control off-policy drift, and a final slow correction. This
reposition-before-update design preserves the objective and rollout process
unchanged, making SFPO plug-compatible with existing policy-gradient pipelines.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFPO consistently improves stability,
reduces rollouts, and accelerates convergence of reasoning RL training.
Specifically, it outperforms GRPO by up to 2.80 points in average on math
reasoning benchmarks. It also achieves up to 4.93\texttimes{} fewer rollouts
and a 4.19\texttimes{} reduction in wall-clock time to match GRPO's best
accuracy.

Abstract: Supervised learning (SL) methods are indispensable for neural network (NN)
training used to perform classification tasks. While resulting in very high
accuracy, SL training often requires making NN parameter number dependent on
the number of classes, limiting their applicability when the number of classes
is extremely large or unknown in advance. In this paper we propose a
methodology that allows one to train the same NN architecture regardless of the
number of classes. This is achieved by using predefined vector systems as the
target latent space configuration (LSC) during NN training. We discuss the
desired properties of target configurations and choose randomly perturbed
vectors of An root system for our experiments. These vectors are used to
successfully train encoders and visual transformers (ViT) on Cinic-10 and
ImageNet-1K in low- and high-dimensional cases by matching NN predictions with
the predefined vectors. Finally, ViT is trained on a dataset with 1.28 million
classes illustrating the applicability of the method to training on datasets
with extremely large number of classes. In addition, potential applications of
LSC in lifelong learning and NN distillation are discussed illustrating
versatility of the proposed methodology.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够在不依赖严格条件的情况下统一处理部分多标签学习和互补多标签学习问题，具有理论保证和实际有效性。

Abstract: Partial multi-label learning and complementary multi-label learning are two
popular weakly supervised multi-label classification paradigms that aim to
alleviate the high annotation costs of collecting precisely annotated
multi-label data. In partial multi-label learning, each instance is annotated
with a candidate label set, among which only some labels are relevant; in
complementary multi-label learning, each instance is annotated with
complementary labels indicating the classes to which the instance does not
belong. Existing consistent approaches for the two paradigms either require
accurate estimation of the generation process of candidate or complementary
labels or assume a uniform distribution to eliminate the estimation problem.
However, both conditions are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we propose consistent approaches that do not rely on
the aforementioned conditions to handle both problems in a unified way.
Specifically, we propose two unbiased risk estimators based on first- and
second-order strategies. Theoretically, we prove consistency w.r.t. two widely
used multi-label classification evaluation metrics and derive convergence rates
for the estimation errors of the proposed risk estimators. Empirically,
extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
approaches against state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Motivated by the remarkable success of Foundation Models (FMs) in language
modeling, there has been growing interest in developing FMs for time series
prediction, given the transformative power such models hold for science and
engineering. This culminated in significant success of FMs in short-range
forecasting settings. However, extrapolation or long-range forecasting remains
elusive for FMs, which struggle to outperform even simple baselines. This
contrasts with physical laws which have strong extrapolation properties, and
raises the question of the fundamental difference between the structure of
neural networks and physical laws. In this work, we identify and formalize a
fundamental property characterizing the ability of statistical learning models
to predict more accurately outside of their training domain, hence explaining
performance deterioration for deep learning models in extrapolation settings.
In addition to a theoretical analysis, we present empirical results showcasing
the implications of this property on current deep learning architectures. Our
results not only clarify the root causes of the extrapolation gap but also
suggest directions for designing next-generation forecasting models capable of
mastering extrapolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在多选结构生成中的不确定性量化仍由简单的最大softmax分数主导，缺乏更有效的量化方法。

Method: 训练多个贝叶斯线性模型，每个模型预测LLM某一层的输出基于前一层的输出，通过层级后验分布推断全局不确定性水平。

Result: 在多种LLM上的数值实验显示，该方法相比现有最优基线取得了持续改进。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯统计方法即使使用最简单的线性回归模型，也能显著提升LLM不确定性量化的性能。

Abstract: Effective Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) represents a key aspect for
reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automated
decision-making and beyond. Yet, for LLM generation with multiple choice
structure, the state-of-the-art in UQ is still dominated by the naive baseline
given by the maximum softmax score. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate
that taking a principled approach via Bayesian statistics leads to improved
performance despite leveraging the simplest possible model, namely linear
regression. More precisely, we propose to train multiple Bayesian linear
models, each predicting the output of a layer given the output of the previous
one. Based on the obtained layer-level posterior distributions, we infer the
global uncertainty level of the LLM by identifying a sparse combination of
distributional features, leading to an efficient UQ scheme. Numerical
experiments on various LLMs show consistent improvement over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Motivation: 机器学习公平性研究主要集中在分类任务上，回归模型的公平性研究相对不足，需要开发专门的公平性测试方法。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is a critical concern, yet most research has
focused on classification tasks, leaving regression models underexplored. This
paper introduces a Wasserstein projection-based framework for fairness testing
in regression models, focusing on expectation-based criteria. We propose a
hypothesis-testing approach and an optimal data perturbation method to improve
fairness while balancing accuracy. Theoretical results include a detailed
categorization of fairness criteria for regression, a dual reformulation of the
Wasserstein projection test statistic, and the derivation of asymptotic bounds
and limiting distributions. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method offers higher specificity compared to
permutation-based tests, and effectively detects and mitigates biases in real
applications such as student performance and housing price prediction.

TL;DR: 本文首次在半自动机模型下建立了统计查询困难性结果，证明了在输入词和初始状态均匀分布时，当字母表大小和输入长度与状态数呈多项式关系时，半自动机存在统计查询困难性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半自动机在自然语言处理、机器人学、计算生物学和数据挖掘等领域有广泛应用，但之前缺乏对其统计查询复杂度的理论研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，探索半自动机内在的统计查询困难性。

Method: 通过将区分两个半自动机最终状态的任务转化为研究在对称群S_N×S_N上的随机游走行为，应用傅里叶分析和对称群表示论工具，获得紧致的谱间隙界限。

Result: 证明了当步数与状态数呈多项式关系时，不同的半自动机变得几乎不相关，从而得到统计查询困难性结果。这与确定性有限自动机的情况不同，后者通常通过识别语言的困难性（如奇偶性）来获得困难性。

Conclusion: 半自动机的统计查询困难性源于其内部状态转移结构，而非所识别的语言特性，这为理解半自动机的计算复杂性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Semiautomata form a rich class of sequence-processing algorithms with
applications in natural language processing, robotics, computational biology,
and data mining. We establish the first Statistical Query hardness result for
semiautomata under the uniform distribution over input words and initial
states. We show that Statistical Query hardness can be established when both
the alphabet size and input length are polynomial in the number of states.
Unlike the case of deterministic finite automata, where hardness typically
arises through the hardness of the language they recognize (e.g., parity), our
result is derived solely from the internal state-transition structure of
semiautomata. Our analysis reduces the task of distinguishing the final states
of two semiautomata to studying the behavior of a random walk on the group
$S_{N} \times S_{N}$. By applying tools from Fourier analysis and the
representation theory of the symmetric group, we obtain tight spectral gap
bounds, demonstrating that after a polynomial number of steps in the number of
states, distinct semiautomata become nearly uncorrelated, yielding the desired
hardness result.

Motivation: 现有方法通常只使用蛋白质的一级结构，但蛋白质具有多级结构（从一级到四级），这些结构都会影响药物-靶点相互作用。

Method: 采用分层注意力机制挖掘多级蛋白质结构与药物结构在局部和全局粒度上的相互作用，然后利用这些相互作用融合不同层次的结构表示进行最终预测。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，ColdDTI在冷启动设置下始终优于先前的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法捕捉了生物学上可转移的先验知识，避免了过度依赖表示学习导致的过拟合风险。

Abstract: Cold-start drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction focuses on interaction
between novel drugs and proteins. Previous methods typically learn transferable
interaction patterns between structures of drug and proteins to tackle it.
However, insight from proteomics suggest that protein have multi-level
structures and they all influence the DTI. Existing works usually represent
protein with only primary structures, limiting their ability to capture
interactions involving higher-level structures. Inspired by this insight, we
propose ColdDTI, a framework attending on protein multi-level structure for
cold-start DTI prediction. We employ hierarchical attention mechanism to mine
interaction between multi-level protein structures (from primary to quaternary)
and drug structures at both local and global granularities. Then, we leverage
mined interactions to fuse structure representations of different levels for
final prediction. Our design captures biologically transferable priors,
avoiding the risk of overfitting caused by excessive reliance on representation
learning. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ColdDTI
consistently outperforms previous methods in cold-start settings.

Conclusion: 位置嵌入通过结构化计算而非扩展能力来影响长度泛化，序列表示复杂度的不变性是实现长度泛化的关键，提出的方法为改进Transformer长度泛化提供了理论洞见和实用策略。

Abstract: In Transformers, Position Embeddings (PEs) significantly influence Length
Generalization (LG) performance, yet their fundamental role remains unclear. In
this work, we investigate the limitations and capabilities of PEs in achieving
LG. We theoretically analyze PEs in Position-Only Linear Attentions (POLAs),
introducing Linear Representation Complexity (LRC) to characterize when PEs
enable LG. Our analysis shows that PEs do not expand computational capabilities
but structure learned computations across positions. Extending to practical
Transformers, we propose Sequential Representation Complexity (SRC) and
conjecture that LG is possible if and only if SRC remains invariant across
scales. We support this hypothesis with empirical evidence in various reasoning
tasks. To enhance LG, we introduce Scale Hint, allowing flexible instance
scaling, and a Learning-Based Position Embedding framework that automatically
learns positional relations. Our work provides theoretical insights and
practical strategies for improving LG in Transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经ODE在时间域建模存在两个主要问题：1)难以捕捉长期依赖和周期结构；2)连续时间模型与离散观测数据的不匹配导致精度损失。

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换将时间序列转换到频域，在傅里叶域中建模动态，并引入可学习的逐元素滤波机制来对齐连续模型输出与离散观测。

Result: 在多个时间序列数据集上的实验表明，FODEs在准确性和效率方面都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FODEs通过有效捕捉长期和短期模式，为时间序列动态建模提供了一个鲁棒框架。

Abstract: Neural ODEs (NODEs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling time series
data, offering the flexibility to adapt to varying input scales and capture
complex dynamics. However, they face significant challenges: first, their
reliance on time-domain representations often limits their ability to capture
long-term dependencies and periodic structures; second, the inherent mismatch
between their continuous-time formulation and the discrete nature of real-world
data can lead to loss of granularity and predictive accuracy. To address these
limitations, we propose Fourier Ordinary Differential Equations (FODEs), an
approach that embeds the dynamics in the Fourier domain. By transforming
time-series data into the frequency domain using the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT), FODEs uncover global patterns and periodic behaviors that remain elusive
in the time domain. Additionally, we introduce a learnable element-wise
filtering mechanism that aligns continuous model outputs with discrete
observations, preserving granularity and enhancing accuracy. Experiments on
various time series datasets demonstrate that FODEs outperform existing methods
in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. By effectively capturing both long-
and short-term patterns, FODEs provide a robust framework for modeling time
series dynamics.

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着向真正高效有效的时间序列预测迈出了重要一步，为处理大规模时间序列数据提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Periodicity is a fundamental characteristic of time series data and has long
played a central role in forecasting. Recent deep learning methods strengthen
the exploitation of periodicity by treating patches as basic tokens, thereby
improving predictive effectiveness. However, their efficiency remains a
bottleneck due to large parameter counts and heavy computational costs. This
paper provides, for the first time, a clear explanation of why patch-level
processing is inherently inefficient, supported by strong evidence from
real-world data. To address these limitations, we introduce a phase perspective
for modeling periodicity and present an efficient yet effective solution,
PhaseFormer. PhaseFormer features phase-wise prediction through compact phase
embeddings and efficient cross-phase interaction enabled by a lightweight
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhaseFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance with around 1k parameters, consistently across
benchmark datasets. Notably, it excels on large-scale and complex datasets,
where models with comparable efficiency often struggle. This work marks a
significant step toward truly efficient and effective time series forecasting.

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODE) have garnered significant
attention for their design of continuous-depth neural networks and the ability
to learn data/feature dynamics. However, for high-dimensional systems,
estimating dynamics requires extensive calculations and suffers from high
truncation errors for the ODE solvers. To address the issue, one intuitive
approach is to consider the non-trivial topological space of the data
distribution, i.e., a low-dimensional manifold. Existing methods often rely on
knowledge of the manifold for projection or implicit transformation,
restricting the ODE solutions on the manifold. Nevertheless, such knowledge is
usually unknown in realistic scenarios. Therefore, we propose a novel approach
to explore the underlying manifold to restrict the ODE process. Specifically,
we employ a structure-preserved encoder to process data and find the underlying
graph to approximate the manifold. Moreover, we propose novel methods to
combine the NODE learning with the manifold, resulting in significant gains in
computational speed and accuracy. Our experimental evaluations encompass
multiple datasets, where we compare the accuracy, number of function
evaluations (NFEs), and convergence speed of our model against existing
baselines. Our results demonstrate superior performance, underscoring the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of high-dimensional
datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对比分析了自回归语言模型(ARMs)和扩散语言模型(DLMs)的性能特征，发现DLMs在算术强度上优于ARMs但难以扩展到长上下文，而块解码DLMs能在保持高算术强度的同时支持长上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然扩散语言模型(DLMs)作为并行生成文本的替代架构出现，但其相对于主流自回归语言模型(ARMs)的性能影响尚未完全理解，需要系统分析两种方法的权衡。

Method: 采用理论分析和性能剖析数据相结合的方法，全面研究ARMs和DLMs的性能特征，特别探索了块解码DLMs和批量推理场景。

Result: DLMs比ARMs具有更高的算术强度，但难以扩展到长上下文；块解码DLMs能提高算术强度并支持长上下文；在批量推理中ARMs吞吐量更优；减少采样步数是加速DLM推理的关键。

Conclusion: DLMs在算术强度上有优势但面临长上下文扩展挑战，块解码是有效解决方案，而减少采样步数对开源DLMs实现更低延迟至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a
broad range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including document
processing and coding. Autoregressive Language Models (ARMs), which generate
tokens sequentially conditioned on all previous tokens, have been the
predominant paradigm for LLMs. However, while these networks have achieved high
accuracy across a range of downstream tasks, they exhibit low arithmetic
intensity due to the inherent sequential dependency with next-token prediction.
Recently, Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative architecture. DLMs generate output text in parallel, breaking the
limitations of sequential dependency. However, the performance implications of
DLMs relative to commonly deployed ARMs are not fully understood. In this work,
we present a comprehensive performance study analyzing the performance
characteristics of ARMs and DLMs, using both theoretical analysis and profiling
data to characterize the trade-offs between these approaches. We illustrate
that although DLMs exhibit higher arithmetic intensity compared to ARMs because
of their capability to utilize parallelism across sequence lengths, they fail
to scale effectively to longer contexts. We then explore DLMs with block-wise
decoding, outlining how this approach allows for increased arithmetic
intensity, while still scaling well to long contexts (similar to ARMs). We also
show interesting trade-offs for batched inference, where we find that ARMs
exhibit superior throughput, as they benefit more from parallelism across
sequences in the batch. Finally, we highlight opportunities for accelerating
DLM inference, and, in particular, highlight the importance of reducing the
number of sampling steps for allowing open-source DLMs to provide improved
latency relative to ARMs.

Method: 引入了一种具有函数逼近的自然critic-actor算法，适用于长期平均成本和不等式约束设置，并提出了改进版本以增强样本复杂度。

Result: 建立了最优学习率，算法在三个不同Safety-Gym环境中的实验表现与其他知名算法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 成功开发了首个适用于约束长期平均成本设置的自然critic-actor算法，提供了理论收敛保证和实证验证。

Abstract: Recent studies have increasingly focused on non-asymptotic convergence
analyses for actor-critic (AC) algorithms. One such effort introduced a
two-timescale critic-actor algorithm for the discounted cost setting using a
tabular representation, where the usual roles of the actor and critic are
reversed. However, only asymptotic convergence was established there.
Subsequently, both asymptotic and non-asymptotic analyses of the critic-actor
algorithm with linear function approximation were conducted. In our work, we
introduce the first natural critic-actor algorithm with function approximation
for the long-run average cost setting and under inequality constraints. We
provide the non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for this algorithm. Our
analysis establishes optimal learning rates and we also propose a modification
to enhance sample complexity. We further show the results of experiments on
three different Safety-Gym environments where our algorithm is found to be
competitive in comparison with other well known algorithms.

Motivation: 深度神经网络训练中的损失爆炸可能使数百万美元的训练运行失效，而传统的监控指标如权重和梯度范数往往滞后且模糊，难以建立统一的失败检测标准。

Method: 引入谱对齐（SA）指标，监测层输入与权重矩阵主奇异向量之间的分布对齐情况，通过分析这种对齐的符号多样性崩溃来预测表示崩溃和训练发散。

Result: 在语言模型上的实证结果表明，监测SA分布比传统标量指标能提供更早、更清晰的损失爆炸预警。

Conclusion: SA具有低计算开销，是保护模型训练的实际可行工具，其对齐多样性的崩溃是表示崩溃和训练发散的有力早期预测指标。

Abstract: Loss explosions in training deep neural networks can nullify multi-million
dollar training runs. Conventional monitoring metrics like weight and gradient
norms are often lagging and ambiguous predictors, as their values vary
dramatically across different models and even between layers of the same model,
making it difficult to establish a unified standard for detecting impending
failure. We introduce Spectral Alignment (SA), a novel, theoretically-grounded
metric that monitors the distributional alignment between layer inputs and the
principal singular vectors of weight matrices. We show that a collapse in the
sign diversity of this alignment is a powerful early predictor of
representational collapse and training divergence. Empirical results on
language models demonstrate that monitoring the SA distribution provides a
significantly earlier and clearer warning of loss explosions than traditional
scalar metrics. SA's low computational overhead makes it a practical tool for
safeguarding model training.

Motivation: 异构联邦学习中，客户端计算能力和数据分布存在差异，传统超参数选择过程手动且计算成本高昂，需要解决目标不一致性和客户端漂移等挑战。

Method: 将联邦学习建模为动态系统，借鉴数值模拟和物理设计原理，通过临界阻尼选择动量参数实现快速稳定收敛，自适应选择学习率满足数值模拟精度要求。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个完全集成的解决方案，能够处理异构联邦学习的关键挑战，无需对客户端和服务器更新进行超参数调优。

Abstract: Hyperparameter selection is critical for stable and efficient convergence of
heterogeneous federated learning, where clients differ in computational
capabilities, and data distributions are non-IID. Tuning hyperparameters is a
manual and computationally expensive process as the hyperparameter space grows
combinatorially with the number of clients. To address this, we introduce an
end-to-end adaptive federated learning method in which both clients and central
agents adaptively select their local learning rates and momentum parameters.
Our approach models federated learning as a dynamical system, allowing us to
draw on principles from numerical simulation and physical design. Through this
perspective, selecting momentum parameters equates to critically damping the
system for fast, stable convergence, while learning rates for clients and
central servers are adaptively selected to satisfy accuracy properties from
numerical simulation. The result is an adaptive, momentum-based federated
learning algorithm in which the learning rates for clients and servers are
dynamically adjusted and controlled by a single, global hyperparameter. By
designing a fully integrated solution for both adaptive client updates and
central agent aggregation, our method is capable of handling key challenges of
heterogeneous federated learning, including objective inconsistency and client
drift. Importantly, our approach achieves fast convergence while being
insensitive to the choice of the global hyperparameter, making it well-suited
for rapid prototyping and scalable deployment. Compared to state-of-the-art
adaptive methods, our framework is shown to deliver superior convergence for
heterogeneous federated learning while eliminating the need for hyperparameter
tuning both client and server updates.

Conclusion: 该框架为KAN压缩提供了首个具有数学保证的形式化基础，为可解释神经架构的高效部署开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offering enhanced interpretability
and a strong mathematical foundation. However, their parameter efficiency
remains a significant challenge for practical deployment. This paper introduces
PolyKAN, a novel theoretical framework for KAN compression that provides formal
guarantees on both model size reduction and approximation error. By leveraging
the inherent piecewise polynomial structure of KANs, we formulate the
compression problem as one of optimal polyhedral region merging. We establish a
rigorous polyhedral characterization of KANs, develop a complete theory of
$\epsilon$-equivalent compression, and design an optimal dynamic programming
algorithm that guarantees minimal compression under specified error bounds. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that PolyKAN achieves provably minimal
compression while maintaining strict error control, with polynomial-time
complexity in all network parameters. The framework provides the first formal
foundation for KAN compression with mathematical guarantees, opening new
directions for efficient deployment of interpretable neural architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DoRAN是一种改进的DoRA方法，通过噪声注入和动态低秩矩阵生成来增强训练稳定性和样本效率，在视觉和语言基准测试中优于LoRA、DoRA等PEFT基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DoRA方法虽然改进了LoRA的学习能力和训练稳定性，但仍存在训练不稳定和样本效率不足的问题，需要进一步优化。

Method: DoRAN包含两个关键阶段：(1)在DoRA权重分解的分母中注入噪声作为自适应正则化器；(2)用辅助网络动态生成低秩矩阵，实现跨层参数耦合。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，DoRAN一致优于LoRA、DoRA和其他PEFT基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合基于噪声的正则化稳定化和基于网络的参数生成，为基础模型的稳健高效微调提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have become the standard
paradigm for adapting large-scale models. Among these techniques,
Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) has been shown to improve both the
learning capacity and training stability of the vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) method by explicitly decomposing pre-trained weights into magnitude and
directional components. In this work, we propose DoRAN, a new variant of DoRA
designed to further stabilize training and boost the sample efficiency of DoRA.
Our approach includes two key stages: (i) injecting noise into the denominator
of DoRA's weight decomposition, which serves as an adaptive regularizer to
mitigate instabilities; and (ii) replacing static low-rank matrices with
auxiliary networks that generate them dynamically, enabling parameter coupling
across layers and yielding better sample efficiency in both theory and
practice. Comprehensive experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that
DoRAN consistently outperforms LoRA, DoRA, and other PEFT baselines. These
results underscore the effectiveness of combining stabilization through
noise-based regularization with network-based parameter generation, offering a
promising direction for robust and efficient fine-tuning of foundation models.

Motivation: 随着计算效率的追求，低精度格式在Transformer模型训练中得到广泛应用，但这种进展常常受到训练不稳定性的阻碍。本文旨在解释Flash Attention在低精度设置下导致灾难性损失爆炸这一长期未解决故障的机制原因。

Method: 通过深入分析揭示故障机制，发现注意力机制中相似低秩表示的出现与低精度算术固有的偏置舍入误差的复合效应是主要原因。引入对Flash Attention的最小修改来减轻舍入误差的偏置。

Result: 分析表明故障不是随机现象，而是由两个相互交织的现象造成的：注意力机制中低秩表示的出现和低精度算术中偏置舍入误差的复合效应。这些因素创建了误差积累的恶性循环，最终破坏训练动态。

Conclusion: 提出的简单修改有效稳定了训练过程，验证了分析的正确性，并为这一持续存在的问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The pursuit of computational efficiency has driven the adoption of
low-precision formats for training transformer models. However, this progress
is often hindered by notorious training instabilities. This paper provides the
first mechanistic explanation for a long-standing and unresolved failure case
where training with flash attention in low-precision settings leads to
catastrophic loss explosions. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the failure is
not a random artifact but caused by two intertwined phenomena: the emergence of
similar low-rank representations within the attention mechanism and the
compounding effect of biased rounding errors inherent in low-precision
arithmetic. We demonstrate how these factors create a vicious cycle of error
accumulation that corrupts weight updates, ultimately derailing the training
dynamics. To validate our findings, we introduce a minimal modification to the
flash attention that mitigates the bias in rounding errors. This simple change
stabilizes the training process, confirming our analysis and offering a
practical solution to this persistent problem.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了PID在连续高维模态中的计算挑战，为多模态数据分析提供了高效可靠的工具，在模型选择和PID量化方面具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The study of multimodality has garnered significant interest in fields where
the analysis of interactions among multiple information sources can enhance
predictive modeling, data fusion, and interpretability. Partial information
decomposition (PID) has emerged as a useful information-theoretic framework to
quantify the degree to which individual modalities independently, redundantly,
or synergistically convey information about a target variable. However,
existing PID methods depend on optimizing over a joint distribution constrained
by estimated pairwise probability distributions, which are costly and
inaccurate for continuous and high-dimensional modalities. Our first key
insight is that the problem can be solved efficiently when the pairwise
distributions are multivariate Gaussians, and we refer to this problem as
Gaussian PID (GPID). We propose a new gradient-based algorithm that
substantially improves the computational efficiency of GPID based on an
alternative formulation of the underlying optimization problem. To generalize
the applicability to non-Gaussian data, we learn information-preserving
encoders to transform random variables of arbitrary input distributions into
pairwise Gaussian random variables. Along the way, we resolved an open problem
regarding the optimality of joint Gaussian solutions for GPID. Empirical
validation in diverse synthetic examples demonstrates that our proposed method
provides more accurate and efficient PID estimates than existing baselines. We
further evaluate a series of large-scale multimodal benchmarks to show its
utility in real-world applications of quantifying PID in multimodal datasets
and selecting high-performing models.

Conclusion: MLLMEraser提供了一种高效、可控制的多模态大语言模型知识遗忘解决方案，平衡遗忘效果与模型效用。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across vision-language tasks, yet their large-scale deployment
raises pressing concerns about memorized private data, outdated knowledge, and
harmful content. Existing unlearning approaches for MLLMs typically adapt
training-based strategies such as gradient ascent or preference optimization,
but these methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and often
distort retained knowledge. In this work, we propose MLLMEraser, an
input-aware, training-free framework for test-time unlearning. Our approach
leverages activation steering to enable dynamic knowledge erasure without
parameter updates. Specifically, we construct a multimodal erasure direction by
contrasting adversarially perturbed, knowledge-recall image-text pairs with
knowledge-erasure counterparts, capturing both textual and visual
discrepancies. To prevent unnecessary interference, we further design an
input-aware steering mechanism that adaptively determines when and how the
erasure direction should be applied, preserving utility on retained knowledge
while enforcing forgetting on designated content. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 and
Qwen-2.5-VL demonstrate that MLLMEraser consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art MLLM unlearning baselines, achieving stronger forgetting
performance with lower computational cost and minimal utility degradation.

Abstract: Accurate and fast urban noise prediction is pivotal for public health and for

generation by >2000 times over a reference solver while improving NLoS accuracy
by up to 24% versus prior deep models; in Baseline NLoS we reach 0.65 dB MAE
with high structural fidelity. The model reproduces diffraction and
interference patterns and supports instant recomputation under source or
geometry changes, making it a practical engine for urban planning, compliance
mapping, and operations (e.g., temporary road closures, night-work variance
assessments).

Abstract: Modeling 3D dynamics is a fundamental problem in multi-body systems across
scientific and engineering domains and has important practical implications in
trajectory prediction and simulation. While recent GNN-based approaches have
achieved strong performance by enforcing geometric symmetries, encoding
high-order features or incorporating neural-ODE mechanics, they typically
depend on explicitly observed structures and inherently fail to capture the
unobserved interactions that are crucial to complex physical behaviors and
dynamics mechanism. In this paper, we propose PAINET, a principled
SE(3)-equivariant neural architecture for learning all-pair interactions in
multi-body systems. The model comprises: (1) a novel physics-inspired attention
network derived from the minimization trajectory of an energy function, and (2)
a parallel decoder that preserves equivariance while enabling efficient
inference. Empirical results on diverse real-world benchmarks, including human
motion capture, molecular dynamics, and large-scale protein simulations, show
that PAINET consistently outperforms recently proposed models, yielding 4.7% to
41.5% error reductions in 3D dynamics prediction with comparable computation
costs in terms of time and memory.

Conclusion: 该算法在保持最优理论性能的同时，实现了计算效率的大幅提升，适用于多种经典损失函数和流式数据处理。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel kernel stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
algorithm for large-scale supervised learning with general losses. Compared to
traditional kernel SGD, our algorithm improves efficiency and scalability
through an innovative regularization strategy. By leveraging the infinite
series expansion of spherical radial basis functions, this strategy projects
the stochastic gradient onto a finite-dimensional hypothesis space, which is
adaptively scaled according to the bias-variance trade-off, thereby enhancing
generalization performance. Based on a new estimation of the spectral structure
of the kernel-induced covariance operator, we develop an analytical framework
that unifies optimization and generalization analyses. We prove that both the
last iterate and the suffix average converge at minimax-optimal rates, and we
further establish optimal strong convergence in the reproducing kernel Hilbert
space. Our framework accommodates a broad class of classical loss functions,
including least-squares, Huber, and logistic losses. Moreover, the proposed
algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity and achieves optimal
storage complexity by incorporating coordinate-wise updates from linear SGD,
thereby avoiding the costly pairwise operations typical of kernel SGD and
enabling efficient processing of streaming data. Finally, extensive numerical
experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.

TL;DR: RegCache是一种无需训练的算法，通过在视觉编码器中引入前缀token来缓解异常值问题，从而实现更精确的量化，显著减少精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉编码器（如CLIP）在多模态应用中需要实时处理大量视觉数据，降低推理成本至关重要。后训练量化是实用路径，但由于大规模激活中的异常值，即使在8位精度下仍具挑战性。

Method: RegCache在目标视觉编码器中引入易产生异常值但语义无意义的前缀token，防止其他token出现异常值。针对视觉编码器中异常值与语言模型不同的行为特点，提出了中间层前缀化和token删除两项技术创新。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在文本监督和自监督视觉编码器中都能一致提升量化模型的准确性。

Conclusion: RegCache通过训练免费的方式有效缓解视觉编码器中的异常值问题，为视觉编码器的量化提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based vision encoders -- such as CLIP -- are central to
multimodal intelligence, powering applications from autonomous web agents to
robotic control. Since these applications often demand real-time processing of
massive visual data, reducing the inference cost of vision encoders is
critical. Post-training quantization offers a practical path, but remains
challenging even at 8-bit precision due to massive-scale activations (i.e.,
outliers). In this work, we propose $\textit{RegCache}$, a training-free
algorithm to mitigate outliers in vision encoders, enabling quantization with
significantly smaller accuracy drops. The proposed RegCache introduces
outlier-prone yet semantically meaningless prefix tokens to the target vision
encoder, which prevents other tokens from having outliers. Notably, we observe
that outliers in vision encoders behave differently from those in language
models, motivating two technical innovations: middle-layer prefixing and token
deletion. Experiments show that our method consistently improves the accuracy
of quantized models across both text-supervised and self-supervised vision
encoders.

Result: 大量实验表明，DAD-SGM相比最先进的GNN到MLP蒸馏方法，能更有效地蒸馏自监督GNN的知识。

Conclusion: 提出的DAD-SGM方法通过扩散模型辅助蒸馏，成功解决了自监督图表示学习中GNN与MLP之间的容量差距问题。

Abstract: For large-scale applications, there is growing interest in replacing Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) with lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via
knowledge distillation. However, distilling GNNs for self-supervised graph
representation learning into MLPs is more challenging. This is because the
performance of self-supervised learning is more related to the model's
inductive bias than supervised learning. This motivates us to design a new
distillation method to bridge a huge capacity gap between GNNs and MLPs in
self-supervised graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{D}iffusion-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{D}istillation for
\textbf{S}elf-supervised \textbf{G}raph representation learning with
\textbf{M}LPs (DAD-SGM). The proposed method employs a denoising diffusion
model as a teacher assistant to better distill the knowledge from the teacher
GNN into the student MLP. This approach enhances the generalizability and
robustness of MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DAD-SGM effectively distills the knowledge of
self-supervised GNNs compared to state-of-the-art GNN-to-MLP distillation
methods. Our implementation is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件生成对抗网络在条件判别器中难以平衡评估真实性和条件对齐的双重目标。

Method: 设计新型判别器，集成无条件判别、匹配感知监督和自适应加权三种能力，使用分离投影分别评估自然性和对齐性。

Conclusion: SONA方法具有多功能性和鲁棒性，能有效解决条件生成中的真实性与对齐平衡问题。

Abstract: Deep generative models have made significant advances in generating complex
content, yet conditional generation remains a fundamental challenge. Existing
conditional generative adversarial networks often struggle to balance the dual
objectives of assessing authenticity and conditional alignment of input samples
within their conditional discriminators. To address this, we propose a novel
discriminator design that integrates three key capabilities: unconditional
discrimination, matching-aware supervision to enhance alignment sensitivity,
and adaptive weighting to dynamically balance all objectives. Specifically, we
introduce Sum of Naturalness and Alignment (SONA), which employs separate
projections for naturalness (authenticity) and alignment in the final layer
with an inductive bias, supported by dedicated objective functions and an
adaptive weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on class-conditional
generation tasks show that \ours achieves superior sample quality and
conditional alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image generation, confirming the
versatility and robustness of our approach.

### [454] [Efficient Latent Variable Causal Discovery: Combining Score Search and Targeted Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04263)
*Joseph Ramsey,Bryan Andrews*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一系列基于分数引导的混合策略因果搜索算法，用于改进FCI算法在存在隐变量或选择偏差时的性能，包括BOSS-FCI、GRaSP-FCI、FCIT和LV-Dumb等方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FCI算法在存在隐变量或选择偏差时，需要进行大量条件独立性测试，导致虚假独立性声明、边错误和不可靠的方向判断，需要更高效可靠的方法。

Method: 开发了四种方法：1) BOSS-FCI和GRaSP-FCI用BOSS或GRaSP替换FGES；2) FCIT用BOSS引导的针对性测试替代穷举测试；3) LV-Dumb直接返回BOSS DAG的PAG，绕过隐变量推理。

Result: 模拟和真实数据分析显示，BOSS-FCI和GRaSP-FCI提供了可靠基线，FCIT提高了效率和可靠性，LV-Dumb在实践中表现出优越的准确性。

Conclusion: 分数引导和针对性策略对于可扩展的隐变量因果发现具有重要价值，这些方法在保持正确性的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is especially challenging
when latent variables or selection bias are present. The Fast Causal Inference
(FCI) algorithm addresses this setting but often performs exhaustive
conditional independence tests across many subsets, leading to spurious
independence claims, extra or missing edges, and unreliable orientations. We
present a family of score-guided mixed-strategy causal search algorithms that
build on this tradition. First, we introduce BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI,
straightforward variants of GFCI that substitute BOSS or GRaSP for FGES,
thereby retaining correctness while incurring different scalability tradeoffs.
Second, we develop FCI Targeted-testing (FCIT), a novel mixed-strategy method
that improves upon these variants by replacing exhaustive all-subsets testing
with targeted tests guided by BOSS, yielding well-formed PAGs with higher
precision and efficiency. Finally, we propose a simple heuristic, LV-Dumb (also
known as BOSS-POD), which bypasses latent-variable-specific reasoning and
directly returns the PAG of the BOSS DAG. Although not strictly correct in the
FCI sense, it scales better and often achieves superior accuracy in practice.
Simulations and real-data analyses demonstrate that BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI
provide sound baselines, FCIT improves both efficiency and reliability, and
LV-Dumb offers a practical heuristic with strong empirical performance.
Together, these method highlight the value of score-guided and targeted
strategies for scalable latent-variable causal discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于影响分支和Thompson采样的在线学习方法来求解混合整数规划问题，该方法在分支定界算法的前几次迭代中应用图导向的变量选择策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在MIP Workshop计算竞赛的背景下，开发新的在线学习方法来解决混合整数规划问题，旨在提高求解效率。

Result: 获得了与最先进在线学习方法相当的结果，并且该方法在更一般的在线框架中泛化良好，能够处理约束矩阵、约束向量和目标系数的变化。

Conclusion: 影响分支与Thompson采样结合的方法在MIP求解中表现良好，具有较好的泛化能力，适用于各种在线学习场景。

Abstract: On the occasion of the 20th Mixed Integer Program Workshop's computational
competition, this work introduces a new approach for learning to solve MIPs
online. Influence branching, a new graph-oriented variable selection strategy,
is applied throughout the first iterations of the branch and bound algorithm.
This branching heuristic is optimized online with Thompson sampling, which
ranks the best graph representations of MIP's structure according to
computational speed up over SCIP. We achieve results comparable to state of the
art online learning methods. Moreover, our results indicate that our method
generalizes well to more general online frameworks, where variations in
constraint matrix, constraint vector and objective coefficients can all occur
and where more samples are available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSD（结构化状态空间对偶性）揭示了结构化状态空间模型与掩码注意力机制之间的等价关系，将线性时间复杂度的递归与二次时间复杂度的注意力统一起来，扩展了序列模型的设计空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了形式化和推广SSD对偶性，从标量恒等情况扩展到一般对角SSM，建立状态空间模型与注意力机制之间更广泛的理论桥梁。

Method: 将SSD从标量恒等情况扩展到一般对角状态空间模型，建立SSM与1-半可分因果掩码注意力等价的充要条件，分析标准softmax注意力无法扩展的原因。

Result: 对角SSM在保持标量情况训练复杂度下界的同时支持更丰富的动态特性，建立了SSM与1-半可分掩码注意力的等价条件，但该对偶性无法扩展到标准softmax注意力。

Conclusion: 这些结果加强了循环SSM与Transformer之间的理论联系，为设计表达力强且高效的序列模型拓宽了设计空间。

Abstract: Structured State-Space Duality (SSD) [Dao & Gu, ICML 2024] is an equivalence
between a simple Structured State-Space Model (SSM) and a masked attention
mechanism. In particular, a state-space model with a scalar-times-identity
state matrix is equivalent to a masked self-attention with a $1$-semiseparable
causal mask. Consequently, the same sequence transformation (model) has two
algorithmic realizations: as a linear-time $O(T)$ recurrence or as a
quadratic-time $O(T^2)$ attention. In this note, we formalize and generalize
this duality: (i) we extend SSD from the scalar-identity case to general
diagonal SSMs (diagonal state matrices); (ii) we show that these diagonal SSMs
match the scalar case's training complexity lower bounds while supporting
richer dynamics; (iii) we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under
which an SSM is equivalent to $1$-semiseparable masked attention; and (iv) we
show that such duality fails to extend to standard softmax attention due to
rank explosion. Together, these results tighten bridge between recurrent SSMs
and Transformers, and widen the design space for expressive yet efficient
sequence models.

Motivation: 解决模型基强化学习中探索效率低的问题，特别是在高维连续控制任务中。现有方法中学习策略与规划器分布不一致，导致价值估计不准确和长期性能下降。

Method: 引入PO-MPC框架，将规划器的动作分布作为策略优化的先验，通过KL正则化来平衡回报最大化和KL散度最小化。统一了现有的MPPI强化学习方法作为特例，并探索了新的变体。

Result: 实验表明扩展配置带来了显著的性能提升，推进了基于MPPI的强化学习的最新技术水平。

Conclusion: PO-MPC框架成功统一了MPPI强化学习方法，通过策略与规划器的对齐提高了探索效率和长期性能。

Abstract: Effective exploration remains a central challenge in model-based
reinforcement learning (MBRL), particularly in high-dimensional continuous
control tasks where sample efficiency is crucial. A prominent line of recent
work leverages learned policies as proposal distributions for Model-Predictive
Path Integral (MPPI) planning. Initial approaches update the sampling policy
independently of the planner distribution, typically maximizing a learned value
function with deterministic policy gradient and entropy regularization.
However, because the states encountered during training depend on the MPPI
planner, aligning the sampling policy with the planner improves the accuracy of
value estimation and long-term performance. To this end, recent methods update
the sampling policy by minimizing KL divergence to the planner distribution or
by introducing planner-guided regularization into the policy update. In this
work, we unify these MPPI-based reinforcement learning methods under a single
framework by introducing Policy Optimization-Model Predictive Control (PO-MPC),
a family of KL-regularized MBRL methods that integrate the planner's action
distribution as a prior in policy optimization. By aligning the learned policy
with the planner's behavior, PO-MPC allows more flexibility in the policy
updates to trade off Return maximization and KL divergence minimization. We
clarify how prior approaches emerge as special cases of this family, and we
explore previously unstudied variations. Our experiments show that these
extended configurations yield significant performance improvements, advancing
the state of the art in MPPI-based RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了HoRA方法，通过共享超网络生成跨注意力头的低秩矩阵，解决了LoRA在多头自注意力中忽视头间协同的问题，在参数效率相近的情况下实现了更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在微调多头自注意力时单独适配每个注意力头，忽视了不同头之间的潜在协同效应，限制了其性能表现。

Method: 使用联合超网络为所有注意力头生成低秩矩阵，通过共享生成器实现跨头信息共享，促进头间协同。

Result: 理论分析表明HoRA比LoRA具有更好的样本效率；在多种语言和视觉基准测试中，HoRA以仅略微增加的参数量超越了LoRA和其他PEFT方法。

Conclusion: HoRA通过跨头信息共享机制有效解决了LoRA的局限性，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
technique that adapts large pre-trained models by adding low-rank matrices to
their weight updates. However, in the context of fine-tuning multi-head
self-attention (MHA), LoRA has been employed to adapt each attention head
separately, thereby overlooking potential synergies across different heads. To
mitigate this issue, we propose a novel Hyper-shared Low-Rank Adaptation (HoRA)
method, which utilizes joint hypernetworks to generate low-rank matrices across
attention heads. By coupling their adaptation through a shared generator, HoRA
encourages cross-head information sharing, and thus directly addresses the
aforementioned limitation of LoRA. By comparing LoRA and HoRA through the lens
of hierarchical mixture of experts, our theoretical findings reveal that the
latter achieves superior sample efficiency to the former. Furthermore, through
extensive experiments across diverse language and vision benchmarks, we
demonstrate that HoRA outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods while requiring
only a marginal increase in the number of trainable parameters.

TL;DR: Wave-PDE Nets是一种基于二阶波动方程模拟的神经网络架构，通过可训练的空间速度和阻尼参数传播隐藏状态，在语言和视觉任务上达到或超过Transformer性能，同时提升30%运行时间和减少25%内存使用。


<details>

Motivation: 为注意力机制和一阶状态空间模型提供振荡、全局的替代方案，利用物理偏置构建计算高效且鲁棒的架构。

Method: 使用基于FFT的辛谱求解器实现O(nlog n)时间复杂度的二阶波动方程传播，每层包含可训练的空间速度c(x)和阻尼γ(x)参数。

Result: 在语言和视觉基准测试中匹配或超越Transformer性能，运行时间减少30%，峰值内存降低25%；消融研究证实辛积分和谱拉普拉斯算子的关键作用。

Conclusion: Wave-PDE Nets作为具有强物理归纳偏置的计算高效架构，通过学习直观的信息传播策略，展现出优越的实用效率和稳定性。

Abstract: We introduce Wave-PDE Nets, a neural architecture whose elementary operation
is a differentiable simulation of the second-order wave equation. Each layer
propagates its hidden state as a continuous field through a medium with
trainable spatial velocity c(x) and damping {\gamma}(x). A symplectic spectral
solver based on FFTs realises this propagation in O(nlog n) time. This
oscillatory, global mechanism provides a powerful alternative to attention and
first-order state-space models. We prove that a single Wave-PDE layer is a
universal approximator. On language and vision benchmarks, Wave-PDE Nets match
or exceed Transformer performance while demonstrating superior practical
efficiency, reducing wall-clock time by up to 30% and peak memory by 25%.
Ablation studies confirm the critical role of symplectic integration and a
spectral Laplacian for stability and performance. Visualizations of the learned
physical parameters reveal that the model learns intuitive strategies for
information propagation. These results position Wave-PDE Nets as a
computationally efficient and robust architecture with a strong physical
inductive bias.

TL;DR: 提出PID Steering框架，将控制理论中的PID控制器应用于LLM激活引导，通过比例、积分、微分三个分量实现更稳定可靠的模型行为控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM行为控制方法主要基于经验，缺乏理论性能保证，需要建立控制理论基础来提供稳定性和可靠性保障。

Method: 将流行的激活引导方法对应为比例控制器，提出完整的PID控制器框架：P项对齐目标语义方向，I项累积误差实现跨层持续修正，D项抑制超调。

Result: 在多个LLM家族和基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PID Steering始终优于现有方法，实现了更鲁棒和可靠的行为控制。

Conclusion: PID Steering为激活引导提供了控制理论基础，建立了可解释的误差动态，并与经典控制理论中的稳定性保证相连接，是轻量级、模块化且易于集成的解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling the behaviors of large language models (LLM) is fundamental to
their safety alignment and reliable deployment. However, existing steering
methods are primarily driven by empirical insights and lack theoretical
performance guarantees. In this work, we develop a control-theoretic foundation
for activation steering by showing that popular steering methods correspond to
the proportional (P) controllers, with the steering vector serving as the
feedback signal. Building on this finding, we propose
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Steering, a principled framework that
leverages the full PID controller for activation steering in LLMs. The
proportional (P) term aligns activations with target semantic directions, the
integral (I) term accumulates errors to enforce persistent corrections across
layers, and the derivative (D) term mitigates overshoot by counteracting rapid
activation changes. This closed-loop design yields interpretable error dynamics
and connects activation steering to classical stability guarantees in control
theory. Moreover, PID Steering is lightweight, modular, and readily integrates
with state-of-the-art steering methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
LLM families and benchmarks demonstrate that PID Steering consistently
outperforms existing approaches, achieving more robust and reliable behavioral
control.

Abstract: Accurate and timely prediction of crash severity is crucial in mitigating the
severe consequences of traffic accidents. Accurate and timely prediction of
crash severity is crucial in mitigating the severe consequences of traffic
accidents. In order to provide appropriate levels of medical assistance and
transportation services, an intelligent transportation system relies on
effective prediction methods. Deep learning models have gained popularity in
this domain due to their capability to capture non-linear relationships among
variables. In this research, we have implemented a hybrid CNN-RNN deep learning
model for crash severity prediction and compared its performance against widely
used statistical and machine learning models such as logistic regression,
na\"ive bayes classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision tree, and
individual deep learning models: RNN and CNN. This study employs a methodology
that considers the interconnected relationships between various features of
traffic accidents. The study was conducted using a dataset of 15,870 accident
records gathered over a period of seven years between 2015 and 2021 on Virginia
highway I-64. The findings demonstrate that the proposed CNN-RNN hybrid model
has outperformed all benchmark models in terms of predicting crash severity.
This result illustrates the effectiveness of the hybrid model as it combines
the advantages of both RNN and CNN models in order to achieve greater accuracy
in the prediction process.

Abstract: Training fair and unbiased machine learning models is crucial for high-stakes

requires deep expertise in fairness definitions, metrics, data preprocessing,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算流体动力学模型虽然有效但计算成本高昂，需要开发更快速的替代模型来预测空气动力学流场，扩散模型在复杂流场预测中显示出巨大潜力。

Method: 使用混合骨干去噪网络，结合卷积特征提取和transformer全局注意力机制；采用DDIM采样优化效率；编码雷诺数、攻角和翼型几何参数作为输入空间。

Conclusion: FoilDiff能够为空气动力学设计和优化提供更准确、更高效的流场预测，在预测精度和不确定性校准方面优于现有的基于扩散的模型。

Abstract: The accurate prediction of flow fields around airfoils is crucial for
aerodynamic design and optimisation. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models
are effective but computationally expensive, thus inspiring the development of
surrogate models to enable quicker predictions. These surrogate models can be
based on deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Diffusion Models (DMs). Diffusion
models have shown significant promise in predicting complex flow fields. In
this work, we propose FoilDiff, a diffusion-based surrogate model with a
hybrid-backbone denoising network. This hybrid design combines the power of
convolutional feature extraction and transformer-based global attention to
generate more adaptable and accurate representations of flow structures.
FoilDiff takes advantage of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) sampling
to optimise the efficiency of the sampling process at no additional cost to
model generalisation. We used encoded representations of Reynolds number, angle
of attack, and airfoil geometry to define the input space for generalisation
across a wide range of aerodynamic conditions. When evaluated against
state-of-the-art models, FoilDiff shows significant performance improvements,
with mean prediction errors reducing by up to 85\% on the same datasets. The
results have demonstrated that FoilDiff can provide both more accurate
predictions and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty than existing
diffusion-based models.

TL;DR: 提出了AM-μP参数化方法，通过约束网络范围内平均单步预激活二阶矩为常数，结合残差感知的He初始化，为卷积和深度残差网络建立了统一的学习率缩放规律η*∝L^{-3/2}。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典μP方法在异构架构中变得不适定，因为残差累积和卷积引入了层间不平衡，需要一种能适应异构架构的学习率参数化方法。

Method: 引入算术平均μP(AM-μP)，约束网络范围平均单步预激活二阶矩为常数，结合残差感知He初始化（残差分支权重按块数缩放）。

Result: 证明对于卷积网络，最大更新学习率满足η*(L)∝L^{-3/2}；对于标准残差网络，η*(L)=Θ(L^{-3/2})，实验验证了-3/2缩放规律并实现了零样本学习率迁移。

Conclusion: AM-μP为卷积和深度残差网络提供了统一实用的学习率原则，无需额外调优开销。

Abstract: Choosing an appropriate learning rate remains a key challenge in scaling
depth of modern deep networks. The classical maximal update parameterization
($\mu$P) enforces a fixed per-layer update magnitude, which is well suited to
homogeneous multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) but becomes ill-posed in
heterogeneous architectures where residual accumulation and convolutions
introduce imbalance across layers. We introduce Arithmetic-Mean $\mu$P
(AM-$\mu$P), which constrains not each individual layer but the network-wide
average one-step pre-activation second moment to a constant scale. Combined
with a residual-aware He fan-in initialization - scaling residual-branch
weights by the number of blocks ($\mathrm{Var}[W]=c/(K\cdot
\mathrm{fan\text{-}in})$) - AM-$\mu$P yields width-robust depth laws that
transfer consistently across depths. We prove that, for one- and
two-dimensional convolutional networks, the maximal-update learning rate
satisfies $\eta^\star(L)\propto L^{-3/2}$; with zero padding, boundary effects
are constant-level as $N\gg k$. For standard residual networks with general
conv+MLP blocks, we establish $\eta^\star(L)=\Theta(L^{-3/2})$, with $L$ the
minimal depth. Empirical results across a range of depths confirm the $-3/2$
scaling law and enable zero-shot learning-rate transfer, providing a unified
and practical LR principle for convolutional and deep residual networks without
additional tuning overhead.

Conclusion: 虽然基于药物警戒实践，但该框架的原则可推广到阳性样本稀少且错误成本可能不对称的领域。成本敏感目标能够使模型性能与操作价值保持一致。

Abstract: Many high-stakes AI applications target low-prevalence events, where apparent
accuracy can conceal limited real-world value. Relevant AI models range from
expert-defined rules and traditional machine learning to generative LLMs
constrained for classification. We outline key considerations for critical
appraisal of AI in rare-event recognition, including problem framing and test
set design, prevalence-aware statistical evaluation, robustness assessment, and
integration into human workflows. In addition, we propose an approach to
structured case-level examination (SCLE), to complement statistical performance
evaluation, and a comprehensive checklist to guide procurement or development
of AI models for rare-event recognition. We instantiate the framework in
pharmacovigilance, drawing on three studies: rule-based retrieval of
pregnancy-related reports; duplicate detection combining machine learning with
probabilistic record linkage; and automated redaction of person names using an
LLM. We highlight pitfalls specific to the rare-event setting including
optimism from unrealistic class balance and lack of difficult positive controls

### [466] [Learning to Predict Chaos: Curriculum-Driven Training for Robust Forecasting of Chaotic Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04342)
*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Curriculum Chaos Forecasting (CCF)训练范式，通过从简单周期系统到复杂混沌系统的渐进式课程学习，提升混沌系统预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习在混沌系统预测中的两个问题：过度专注于单一系统导致泛化性差，或混合不相关时间序列导致无法学习特定动态机制

Method: 使用最大Lyapun夫指数和吸引子维度量化系统复杂性，构建包含50+合成ODE/PDE系统的课程库，从简单周期行为逐步训练到高度混沌动态

Result: 在太阳黑子数、电力需求和人体心电图等真实世界数据集上，CCF相比随机顺序训练将有效预测时间延长40%，相比仅使用真实数据训练延长超过一倍

Conclusion: 基于动态系统理论的课程学习能够显著提升混沌系统预测的泛化能力和性能，这一优势在不同神经网络架构中保持一致

Abstract: Forecasting chaotic systems is a cornerstone challenge in many scientific
fields, complicated by the exponential amplification of even infinitesimal
prediction errors. Modern machine learning approaches often falter due to two
opposing pitfalls: over-specializing on a single, well-known chaotic system
(e.g., Lorenz-63), which limits generalizability, or indiscriminately mixing
vast, unrelated time-series, which prevents the model from learning the nuances
of any specific dynamical regime. We propose Curriculum Chaos Forecasting
(CCF), a training paradigm that bridges this gap. CCF organizes training data
based on fundamental principles of dynamical systems theory, creating a
curriculum that progresses from simple, periodic behaviors to highly complex,
chaotic dynamics. We quantify complexity using the largest Lyapunov exponent
and attractor dimension, two well-established metrics of chaos. By first
training a sequence model on predictable systems and gradually introducing more
chaotic trajectories, CCF enables the model to build a robust and generalizable
representation of dynamical behaviors. We curate a library of over 50 synthetic
ODE/PDE systems to build this curriculum. Our experiments show that
pre-training with CCF significantly enhances performance on unseen, real-world
benchmarks. On datasets including Sunspot numbers, electricity demand, and
human ECG signals, CCF extends the valid prediction horizon by up to 40%
compared to random-order training and more than doubles it compared to training
on real-world data alone. We demonstrate that this benefit is consistent across
various neural architectures (GRU, Transformer) and provide extensive ablations
to validate the importance of the curriculum's structure.

*Anoushka Harit,Zhongtian Sun,Jongmin Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Causal Sphere Hypergraph Transformer (CSHT)，一种用于可解释金融时间序列预测的新架构，结合Granger因果超图结构、黎曼几何和因果掩码Transformer注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够建模金融新闻和情绪对资产收益定向影响的可解释预测模型，在不确定性下提供可信赖的金融预测。

Method: 提取多元Granger因果依赖关系，将其编码为超球面上的定向超边；通过保持时间方向性和几何一致性的角度掩码约束注意力机制。

Result: 在2018-2023年S&P 500数据（包括2020年COVID-19冲击）上评估，CSHT在收益预测、制度分类和顶级资产排名任务中始终优于基线模型。

Conclusion: CSHT通过强制预测因果结构和在黎曼流形中嵌入变量，实现了跨市场制度的鲁棒泛化和从宏观经济事件到股票层面响应的透明归因路径，是可信赖金融预测的原则性和实用解决方案。

Abstract: We propose the Causal Sphere Hypergraph Transformer (CSHT), a novel
architecture for interpretable financial time-series forecasting that unifies
\emph{Granger-causal hypergraph structure}, \emph{Riemannian geometry}, and
\emph{causally masked Transformer attention}. CSHT models the directional
influence of financial news and sentiment on asset returns by extracting
multivariate Granger-causal dependencies, which are encoded as directional
hyperedges on the surface of a hypersphere. Attention is constrained via
angular masks that preserve both temporal directionality and geometric
consistency. Evaluated on S\&P 500 data from 2018 to 2023, including the 2020
COVID-19 shock, CSHT consistently outperforms baselines across return
prediction, regime classification, and top-asset ranking tasks. By enforcing
predictive causal structure and embedding variables in a Riemannian manifold,
CSHT delivers both \emph{robust generalisation across market regimes} and
\emph{transparent attribution pathways} from macroeconomic events to
stock-level responses. These results suggest that CSHT is a principled and
practical solution for trustworthy financial forecasting under uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类生成的分类注释经常产生反映模糊性而非简单标注错误的经验响应分布，需要一种能够量化这种偶然不确定性的方法。

Method: 引入一种模糊性度量，将离散响应分布映射到单位区间内的标量，与二次熵密切相关但处理'无法解决'类别时采用不对称方式，并提供频率论点估计和贝叶斯后验推断工具。

Result: 该度量能够有效区分类别级不可区分性和明确不可解决性，提供了统计推断框架，并在数值示例中展示了在数据集质量评估和机器学习工作流程中的实际应用。

Conclusion: 提出的模糊性度量为分类任务中的不确定性量化提供了新的理论框架和实用工具，特别适用于处理人类标注中固有的模糊性问题。

Abstract: Human-generated categorical annotations frequently produce empirical response
distributions (soft labels) that reflect ambiguity rather than simple annotator
error. We introduce an ambiguity measure that maps a discrete response
distribution to a scalar in the unit interval, designed to quantify aleatoric
uncertainty in categorical tasks. The measure bears a close relationship to
quadratic entropy (Gini-style impurity) but departs from those indices by
treating an explicit "can't solve" category asymmetrically, thereby separating
uncertainty arising from class-level indistinguishability from uncertainty due
to explicit unresolvability. We analyze the measure's formal properties and
contrast its behavior with a representative ambiguity measure from the
literature. Moving beyond description, we develop statistical tools for
inference: we propose frequentist point estimators for population ambiguity and
derive the Bayesian posterior over ambiguity induced by Dirichlet priors on the
underlying probability vector, providing a principled account of epistemic
uncertainty. Numerical examples illustrate estimation, calibration, and
practical use for dataset-quality assessment and downstream machine-learning
workflows.

Abstract: We introduce GDPval, a benchmark evaluating AI model capabilities on
real-world economically valuable tasks. GDPval covers the majority of U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics Work Activities for 44 occupations across the top 9
sectors contributing to U.S. GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Tasks are
constructed from the representative work of industry professionals with an

### [470] [Adaptive Weighted Loss for Sequential Recommendations on Sparse Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04375)
*Akshay Mittal,Vinay Venkatesh,Krishna Kandi,Shalini Sudarshan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出动态加权损失函数，根据训练数据中每个领域的稀疏度自适应调整损失权重，稀疏领域获得更高权重，解决传统固定加权损失在稀疏领域训练信号被稀释的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模型序列推荐架构在处理稀疏或小众领域的"强力用户"时效果有限，之前的PinnerFormerLite使用固定加权损失，但单一权重无法有效处理交互极少的领域，训练信号容易被通用数据集稀释。

Method: 提出数据驱动的动态加权损失函数，包含自适应算法，基于每个领域在训练数据中的稀疏度调整损失权重，稀疏领域权重更高，密集领域权重更低，确保罕见用户兴趣也能产生有意义的梯度信号。

Result: 在四个多样化数据集（MovieLens、Amazon Electronics、Yelp Business、LastFM Music）上验证，与SIGMA、CALRec、SparseEnNet等先进基线相比，动态加权系统显著优于所有对比方法，特别是在稀疏领域，Recall@10和NDCG@10指标大幅提升，同时在密集领域保持性能，计算开销最小。

Conclusion: 动态加权损失函数通过理论分析和实证验证，证明能有效提升稀疏领域的推荐性能，同时保持整体系统的稳定性和效率。

Abstract: The effectiveness of single-model sequential recommendation architectures,
while scalable, is often limited when catering to "power users" in sparse or
niche domains. Our previous research, PinnerFormerLite, addressed this by using
a fixed weighted loss to prioritize specific domains. However, this approach
can be sub-optimal, as a single, uniform weight may not be sufficient for
domains with very few interactions, where the training signal is easily diluted
by the vast, generic dataset.
  This paper proposes a novel, data-driven approach: a Dynamic Weighted Loss
function with comprehensive theoretical foundations and extensive empirical
validation. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the loss weight for
each domain based on its sparsity in the training data, assigning a higher
weight to sparser domains and a lower weight to denser ones. This ensures that
even rare user interests contribute a meaningful gradient signal, preventing
them from being overshadowed.
  We provide rigorous theoretical analysis including convergence proofs,
complexity analysis, and bounds analysis to establish the stability and
efficiency of our approach. Our comprehensive empirical validation across four
diverse datasets (MovieLens, Amazon Electronics, Yelp Business, LastFM Music)
with state-of-the-art baselines (SIGMA, CALRec, SparseEnNet) demonstrates that
this dynamic weighting system significantly outperforms all comparison methods,
particularly for sparse domains, achieving substantial lifts in key metrics
like Recall at 10 and NDCG at 10 while maintaining performance on denser
domains and introducing minimal computational overhead.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的神经网络训练视角：将学习视为参数空间到表示空间的结构保持变换（函子L），通过范畴论框架揭示同伦类优化路径与泛化性能的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统将神经网络训练视为损失曲面梯度下降的视角有限，需要更根本的理论框架来理解为什么深度学习有效以及不同训练过程如何产生相似泛化性能。

Method: 建立范畴论框架，将学习建模为函子L: Param → Rep，使用同伦理论分析优化路径，通过持久同调识别稳定极小值，并应用2-范畴结构解释不同优化算法的等价性。

Result: 实验表明同伦轨迹收敛的网络泛化精度差异在0.5%以内，非同伦路径差异超过3%；持久同调与泛化性能的相关性R²=0.82。

Conclusion: 范畴不变量既提供了深度学习为何有效的理论洞察，又为训练更鲁棒网络提供了具体算法原则，包括形式化迁移学习的回拉构造和优化算法等价性的解释。

Abstract: Neural network training is typically viewed as gradient descent on a loss
surface. We propose a fundamentally different perspective: learning is a
structure-preserving transformation (a functor L) between the space of network
parameters (Param) and the space of learned representations (Rep). This
categorical framework reveals that different training runs producing similar
test performance often belong to the same homotopy class (continuous
deformation family) of optimization paths. We show experimentally that networks
converging via homotopic trajectories generalize within 0.5% accuracy of each
other, while non-homotopic paths differ by over 3%. The theory provides
practical tools: persistent homology identifies stable minima predictive of
generalization (R^2 = 0.82 correlation), pullback constructions formalize
transfer learning, and 2-categorical structures explain when different
optimization algorithms yield functionally equivalent models. These categorical
invariants offer both theoretical insight into why deep learning works and
concrete algorithmic principles for training more robust networks.

Result: 实验在合成和真实数据上验证了该方法的有效性，能够识别包含潜在变量的真实结构到马尔可夫等价类。

Conclusion: LGES是首个具有可识别性保证的基于分数的贪心搜索方法，能够有效处理部分观测场景下的因果发现问题。

Abstract: Identifying the structure of a partially observed causal system is essential
to various scientific fields. Recent advances have focused on constraint-based
causal discovery to solve this problem, and yet in practice these methods often
face challenges related to multiple testing and error propagation. These issues
could be mitigated by a score-based method and thus it has raised great
attention whether there exists a score-based greedy search method that can
handle the partially observed scenario. In this work, we propose the first
score-based greedy search method for the identification of structure involving
latent variables with identifiability guarantees. Specifically, we propose
Generalized N Factor Model and establish the global consistency:
  the true structure including latent variables can be identified up to the
Markov equivalence class by using score. We then design
  Latent variable Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a greedy search algorithm
for this class of model with well-defined operators,
  which search very efficiently over the graph space to find the optimal
structure. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-life data validate the
effectiveness of our method (code will be publicly available).

Abstract: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) generates dense data streams critical for

baseline, adds interpretability through variable selection and temporal
attribution, and enables counterfactual forecasts simulating how planned
changes in physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, respiration) affect
near-term glucose. Together, these features make SSM-CGM an interpretable,

<details>

Motivation: 现有性能强化学习方法只能收敛到性能稳定（PS）策略，但PS策略与期望的性能最优（PO）策略之间存在可证明的正常数差距。本文旨在直接找到PO策略。

Method: 提出了零阶Frank-Wolfe算法（0-FW），在Frank-Wolfe框架中使用性能策略梯度的零阶近似，并在标准正则化主导条件下实现多项式时间收敛。

Result: 证明了在策略正则化主导环境变化时，价值函数满足梯度主导性质，任何驻点都是PO策略；同时证明了所有充分驻点位于凸紧策略子空间中，梯度有界且Lipschitz连续。

Conclusion: 0-FW算法是首个在多项式时间内收敛到PO策略的方法，实验证明比现有算法更有效地找到期望的PO策略。

Abstract: Performative reinforcement learning is an emerging dynamical decision making
framework, which extends reinforcement learning to the common applications
where the agent's policy can change the environmental dynamics. Existing works
on performative reinforcement learning only aim at a performatively stable (PS)
policy that maximizes an approximate value function. However, there is a
provably positive constant gap between the PS policy and the desired
performatively optimal (PO) policy that maximizes the original value function.
In contrast, this work proposes a zeroth-order Frank-Wolfe algorithm (0-FW)
algorithm with a zeroth-order approximation of the performative policy gradient
in the Frank-Wolfe framework, and obtains \textbf{the first polynomial-time
convergence to the desired PO} policy under the standard regularizer dominance
condition. For the convergence analysis, we prove two important properties of
the nonconvex value function. First, when the policy regularizer dominates the
environmental shift, the value function satisfies a certain gradient dominance
property, so that any stationary point (not PS) of the value function is a
desired PO. Second, though the value function has unbounded gradient, we prove
that all the sufficiently stationary points lie in a convex and compact policy
subspace $\Pi_{\Delta}$, where the policy value has a constant lower bound
$\Delta>0$ and thus the gradient becomes bounded and Lipschitz continuous.
Experimental results also demonstrate that our 0-FW algorithm is more effective
than the existing algorithms in finding the desired PO policy.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了联邦学习中鲁棒聚合器的性能与拜占庭客户端数量估计之间的关系，揭示了低估拜占庭客户端数量会导致性能急剧下降，而非低估情况下存在性能与鲁棒性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习易受拜占庭客户端攻击，现有研究通常需要估计拜占庭客户端数量来选择合适鲁棒度的聚合器，但这种估计对性能的影响尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究不同拜占庭客户端估计值对聚合器和联邦学习算法最坏情况误差的影响，包括低估和非低估两种情况。

Result: 低估拜占庭客户端数量会导致任意差的性能；非低估情况下，证明了聚合器和联邦学习误差的最优上下界，这些界与 $\hat{f}/(n-f-\hat{f})$ 成正比，随 $\hat{f}$ 增大而单调增加。

Conclusion: 存在基本权衡：虽然更大鲁棒度的聚合器能处理更广泛的拜占庭客户端问题，但当实际拜占庭客户端较少时性能会恶化。

Abstract: Federated learning has attracted increasing attention at recent large-scale
optimization and machine learning research and applications, but is also
vulnerable to Byzantine clients that can send any erroneous signals. Robust
aggregators are commonly used to resist Byzantine clients. This usually
requires to estimate the unknown number $f$ of Byzantine clients, and thus
accordingly select the aggregators with proper degree of robustness (i.e., the
maximum number $\hat{f}$ of Byzantine clients allowed by the aggregator). Such
an estimation should have important effect on the performance, which has not
been systematically studied to our knowledge. This work will fill in the gap by
theoretically analyzing the worst-case error of aggregators as well as its
induced federated learning algorithm for any cases of $\hat{f}$ and $f$.
Specifically, we will show that underestimation ($\hat{f}<f$) can lead to
arbitrarily poor performance for both aggregators and federated learning. For
non-underestimation ($\hat{f}\ge f$), we have proved optimal lower and upper
bounds of the same order on the errors of both aggregators and federated
learning. All these optimal bounds are proportional to $\hat{f}/(n-f-\hat{f})$
with $n$ clients, which monotonically increases with larger $\hat{f}$. This
indicates a fundamental trade-off: while an aggregator with a larger robustness
degree $\hat{f}$ can solve federated learning problems of wider range $f\in
[0,\hat{f}]$, the performance can deteriorate when there are actually fewer or
even no Byzantine clients (i.e., $f\in [0,\hat{f})$).

Abstract: In this work, we introduce novel algorithms for label propagation and
self-training using fractional heat kernel dynamics with a source term. We
motivate the methodology through the classical correspondence of information
theory with the physics of parabolic evolution equations. We integrate the
fractional heat kernel into Graph Neural Network architectures such as Graph
Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention, enhancing their expressiveness
through adaptive, multi-hop diffusion. By applying Chebyshev polynomial
approximations, large graphs become computationally feasible. Motivating
variational formulations demonstrate that by extending the classical diffusion
model to fractional powers of the Laplacian, nonlocal interactions deliver more
globally diffusing labels. The particular balance between supervision of known
labels and diffusion across the graph is particularly advantageous in the case
where only a small number of labeled training examples are present. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on standard datasets.

Motivation: 领域泛化文献中普遍发现很难超越在合并训练数据上的经验风险最小化方法，作者认为这一发现主要基于满足协变量偏移假设的数据集，而在满足后验漂移假设的数据集上情况可能不同。

Method: 提出"领域信息增强的经验风险最小化"方法，通过将特征向量与领域特定信息进行增强，以处理后验漂移情况。

Result: 在语言和视觉任务上的实验表明，当数据集满足后验漂移假设时，领域信息增强的ERM方法优于合并ERM方法。

Conclusion: 领域泛化方法的有效性取决于数据集满足的假设类型，在后验漂移情况下，使用领域特定信息可以显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization (DG) is the problem of generalizing from several
distributions (or domains), for which labeled training data are available, to a
new test domain for which no labeled data is available. A common finding in the
DG literature is that it is difficult to outperform empirical risk minimization
(ERM) on the pooled training data.
  In this work, we argue that this finding has primarily been reported for
datasets satisfying a \emph{covariate shift} assumption. When the dataset
satisfies a \emph{posterior drift} assumption instead, we show that
``domain-informed ERM,'' wherein feature vectors are augmented with
domain-specific information, outperforms pooling ERM. These claims are
supported by a theoretical framework and experiments on language and vision
tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出并形式化了分叉序列方法，该方法通过联合编码和解码所有预测创建日期的时间序列，显著提高了时间序列预测的稳定性，在多个数据集上平均提升了8.8%-37.9%的预测稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然准确性是时间序列预测模型的关键要求，但预测稳定性同样重要却常被忽视。即使高度准确的模型也可能在不同预测创建日期之间产生不稳定的修订，这会损害利益相关者的信任并扰乱下游决策。

Method: 采用分叉序列方法，与标准统计和神经预测方法独立处理每个预测创建日期不同，该方法联合编码和解码所有预测创建日期的整个时间序列，类似于时间序列交叉验证的方式。

Result: 在M1、M3、M4和Tourism竞赛的16个数据集上验证，分叉序列方法使MLP、RNN、LSTM、CNN和基于Transformer的架构的预测百分比变化稳定性分别提高了28.8%、28.8%、37.9%、31.3%和平均8.8%。

Conclusion: 分叉序列方法具有三个关键优势：训练过程中更稳定一致的梯度更新、通过集成减少预测方差、提高推理计算效率，值得在更广泛的神经预测社区中推广使用。

Abstract: While accuracy is a critical requirement for time series forecasting models,
an equally important (yet often overlooked) desideratum is forecast stability
across forecast creation dates (FCDs). Even highly accurate models can produce
erratic revisions between FCDs, undermining stakeholder trust and disrupting
downstream decision-making. To improve forecast stability, models like MQCNN,
MQT, and SPADE employ a little-known but highly effective technique:
forking-sequences. Unlike standard statistical and neural forecasting methods
that treat each FCD independently, the forking-sequences method jointly encodes
and decodes the entire time series across all FCDs, in a way mirroring time
series cross-validation. Since forking sequences remains largely unknown in the
broader neural forecasting community, in this work, we formalize the
forking-sequences approach, and we make a case for its broader adoption. We
demonstrate three key benefits of forking-sequences: (i) more stable and
consistent gradient updates during training; (ii) reduced forecast variance
through ensembling; and (iii) improved inference computational efficiency. We
validate forking-sequences' benefits using 16 datasets from the M1, M3, M4, and
Tourism competitions, showing improvements in forecast percentage change
stability of 28.8%, 28.8%, 37.9%, and 31.3%, and 8.8%, on average, for MLP,
RNN, LSTM, CNN, and Transformer-based architectures, respectively.

show that this gain corresponds with a decrease in interference between
multiple features that would otherwise share the same neurons. To reduce such
entanglement at a fixed non-zero parameter count, we introduce Fixed Parameter
Expansion (FPE): replace a neuron with multiple children and partition the
parent's weights disjointly across them, so that each child inherits a
non-overlapping subset of connections. On symbolic tasks, specifically Boolean
code problems, clause-aligned FPE systematically reduces polysemanticity
metrics and yields higher task accuracy. Notably, random splits of neuron
weights approximate these gains, indicating that reduced collisions, not
precise assignment, are a primary driver. Consistent with the superposition
hypothesis, the benefits of FPE grow with increasing interference: when
polysemantic load is high, accuracy improvements are the largest. Transferring
these insights to real models (classifiers over CLIP embeddings and deeper
multilayer networks) we find that widening networks while maintaining a
constant non-zero parameter count consistently increases accuracy. These
results identify an interpretability-grounded mechanism to leverage width
against superposition, improving performance without increasing the number of
non-zero parameters. Such a direction is well matched to modern accelerators,
where memory movement of non-zero parameters, rather than raw compute, is the
dominant bottleneck.

TL;DR: 提出WISDOM方法，利用小波域预测任务表示来增强非平稳强化学习，通过小波变换捕捉多尺度特征，并设计了小波时序差分更新算子，在复杂非平稳环境中显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界本质上是非平稳的，现有NSRL方法主要关注具有规律演化模式的任务，在高度动态环境中的适应性有限。受小波分析在时间序列建模中成功捕捉多尺度信号趋势的启发，旨在提升NSRL在动态环境中的适应性。

Conclusion: WISDOM通过小波域任务表示和小波TD更新算子，有效提升了NSRL在高度动态环境中的适应能力，为处理现实世界非平稳性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The real world is inherently non-stationary, with ever-changing factors, such
as weather conditions and traffic flows, making it challenging for agents to
adapt to varying environmental dynamics. Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning
(NSRL) addresses this challenge by training agents to adapt rapidly to
sequences of distinct Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, existing NSRL
approaches often focus on tasks with regularly evolving patterns, leading to
limited adaptability in highly dynamic settings. Inspired by the success of
Wavelet analysis in time series modeling, specifically its ability to capture
signal trends at multiple scales, we propose WISDOM to leverage wavelet-domain
predictive task representations to enhance NSRL. WISDOM captures these
multi-scale features in evolving MDP sequences by transforming task
representation sequences into the wavelet domain, where wavelet coefficients
represent both global trends and fine-grained variations of non-stationary
changes. In addition to the auto-regressive modeling commonly employed in time
series forecasting, we devise a wavelet temporal difference (TD) update
operator to enhance tracking and prediction of MDP evolution. We theoretically
prove the convergence of this operator and demonstrate policy improvement with
wavelet task representations. Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that
WISDOM significantly outperforms existing baselines in both sample efficiency
and asymptotic performance, demonstrating its remarkable adaptability in
complex environments characterized by non-stationary and stochastically
evolving tasks.

TL;DR: GeoMancer是一个黎曼图扩散框架，通过等距不变黎曼陀螺核方法和流形约束扩散，解决了图数据中不同曲率特征在统一潜在空间中的纠缠问题，在生成和预测任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图扩散方法将节点、边和图级特征嵌入到统一的潜在空间中，但由于图数据的非欧几里得性质，不同曲率的特征在同一潜在空间中纠缠，未能充分发挥其几何潜力。

Method: 提出GeoMancer框架：1）用等距不变黎曼陀螺核方法替代指数映射，缓解编码过程中的数值不稳定性；2）将多级特征解耦到各自的任务特定流形上；3）引入流形约束扩散方法和自引导策略，确保生成数据与流形特征对齐。

Conclusion: GeoMancer通过捕捉复杂图数据的独特流形特征并学习其分布，成功解决了图扩散模型中的数值不稳定性和流形偏差问题，为图数据的生成和预测任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph diffusion models have made significant progress in learning structured
graph data and have demonstrated strong potential for predictive tasks.
Existing approaches typically embed node, edge, and graph-level features into a
unified latent space, modeling prediction tasks including classification and
regression as a form of conditional generation. However, due to the
non-Euclidean nature of graph data, features of different curvatures are
entangled in the same latent space without releasing their geometric potential.
To address this issue, we aim to construt an ideal Riemannian diffusion model
to capture distinct manifold signatures of complex graph data and learn their
distribution. This goal faces two challenges: numerical instability caused by
exponential mapping during the encoding proces and manifold deviation during
diffusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GeoMancer: a
novel Riemannian graph diffusion framework for both generation and prediction
tasks. To mitigate numerical instability, we replace exponential mapping with
an isometric-invariant Riemannian gyrokernel approach and decouple multi-level
features onto their respective task-specific manifolds to learn optimal
representations. To address manifold deviation, we introduce a
manifold-constrained diffusion method and a self-guided strategy for
unconditional generation, ensuring that the generated data remains aligned with
the manifold signature. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our
approach, demonstrating superior performance across a variety of tasks.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have shown promising performance in generating
high-quality samples in a wide range of domains, but accelerating their
sampling process remains relatively underexplored. To investigate efficient
samplers for masked diffusion, this paper theoretically analyzes the MaskGIT
sampler for image modeling, revealing its implicit temperature sampling
mechanism. Through this analysis, we introduce the "moment sampler," an
asymptotically equivalent but more tractable and interpretable alternative to
MaskGIT, which employs a "choose-then-sample" approach by selecting unmasking
positions before sampling tokens. In addition, we improve the efficiency of
choose-then-sample algorithms through two key innovations: a partial caching
technique for transformers that approximates longer sampling trajectories
without proportional computational cost, and a hybrid approach formalizing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off in adaptive unmasking. Experiments in image
and text domains demonstrate our theory as well as the efficiency of our
proposed methods, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical
implementation of masked diffusion samplers.

TL;DR: 现有基于图的表格深度学习(GTDL)方法过度关注预测精度而忽视了特征交互图结构的学习，本文主张GTDL应转向结构感知建模，通过实验证明准确学习特征交互结构能提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统树模型在表格数据上仍优于深度学习方法，关键在于建模复杂的特征交互。现有GTDL方法主要优化预测精度，忽略了图结构的准确建模。

Method: 使用具有已知真实图结构的合成数据集，评估现有GTDL方法恢复特征交互的能力，并验证强制使用真实交互结构对预测性能的影响。

Result: 现有GTDL方法无法恢复有意义的特征交互，但强制使用真实交互结构能提高预测性能。

Conclusion: GTDL方法需要转向结构感知建模，优先考虑特征交互的定量评估和准确结构学习，以构建不仅准确且可解释、可信赖的系统。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, deep learning methods for tabular data still
struggle to compete with traditional tree-based models. A key challenge lies in
modeling complex, dataset-specific feature interactions that are central to
tabular data. Graph-based tabular deep learning (GTDL) methods aim to address
this by representing features and their interactions as graphs. However,
existing methods predominantly optimize predictive accuracy, neglecting
accurate modeling of the graph structure. This position paper argues that GTDL
should move beyond prediction-centric objectives and prioritize the explicit
learning and evaluation of feature interactions. Using synthetic datasets with
known ground-truth graph structures, we show that existing GTDL methods fail to
recover meaningful feature interactions. Moreover, enforcing the true
interaction structure improves predictive performance. This highlights the need
for GTDL methods to prioritize quantitative evaluation and accurate structural
learning. We call for a shift toward structure-aware modeling as a foundation
for building GTDL systems that are not only accurate but also interpretable,
trustworthy, and grounded in domain understanding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tail-Safe是一个面向部署的衍生品对冲框架，结合了分布强化学习和基于控制屏障函数的安全层，通过IQN-CVaR-PPO算法优化尾部风险，使用QP安全层强制执行金融约束，在合成市场中实现了零硬约束违规和改善的尾部风险管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统衍生品对冲方法在极端市场条件下可能失效，需要一种既能优化尾部风险又能保证硬约束安全的可部署框架，以支持监管合规和风险管理。

Method: 结合IQN-CVaR-PPO分布强化学习算法（使用温度倾斜和尾部增强技术）与基于CBF的QP安全层，强制执行椭圆无交易带、箱型限制、速率限制和符号一致性门等金融约束。

Result: 在无套利的合成市场中，Tail-Safe改善了左尾风险而不损害中心性能，在QP可行且无松弛时实现零硬约束违规，并提供了可审计的遥测数据用于治理仪表板。

Conclusion: 该框架为衍生品对冲提供了理论保证和实际部署能力，但依赖于合成数据和简化执行来隔离方法学贡献。

Abstract: We introduce Tail-Safe, a deployability-oriented framework for derivatives
hedging that unifies distributional, risk-sensitive reinforcement learning with
a white-box control-barrier-function (CBF) quadratic-program (QP) safety layer
tailored to financial constraints. The learning component combines an IQN-based
distributional critic with a CVaR objective (IQN--CVaR--PPO) and a
Tail-Coverage Controller that regulates quantile sampling through temperature
tilting and tail boosting to stabilize small-$\alpha$ estimation. The safety
component enforces discrete-time CBF inequalities together with domain-specific
constraints -- ellipsoidal no-trade bands, box and rate limits, and a
sign-consistency gate -- solved as a convex QP whose telemetry (active sets,
tightness, rate utilization, gate scores, slack, and solver status) forms an
auditable trail for governance. We provide guarantees of robust forward
invariance of the safe set under bounded model mismatch, a minimal-deviation
projection interpretation of the QP, a KL-to-DRO upper bound linking per-state
KL regularization to worst-case CVaR, concentration and sample-complexity
results for the temperature-tilted CVaR estimator, and a CVaR trust-region
improvement inequality under KL limits, together with feasibility persistence
under expiry-aware tightening. Empirically, in arbitrage-free,
microstructure-aware synthetic markets (SSVI $\to$ Dupire $\to$ VIX with
ABIDES/MockLOB execution), Tail-Safe improves left-tail risk without degrading
central performance and yields zero hard-constraint violations whenever the QP
is feasible with zero slack. Telemetry is mapped to governance dashboards and
incident workflows to support explainability and auditability. Limitations
include reliance on synthetic data and simplified execution to isolate
methodological contributions.

Motivation: 在多用户MIMO下行链路中，由于动作空间呈指数级增长，穷举搜索不可行，需要开发高效的探索方法来识别最优的用户调度子集。

Method: 采用线性效用模型，引入间隙索引框架，维护当前冠军臂（前m个集合）的短列表和挑战者臂的旋转短列表，专注于提供最有信息量的间隙索引比较的测量。

Result: 与最先进的线性bandit方法相比，显著减少了运行时间和计算量，同时保持了高识别准确率，并暴露了速度与精度之间的可调权衡。

Conclusion: 短列表驱动的纯探索使得在线、测量高效的子载波选择在AI赋能通信系统中变得实用可行。

Abstract: This paper investigates the identification of the top-m user-scheduling sets
in multi-user MIMO downlink, which is cast as a combinatorial pure-exploration
problem in stochastic linear bandits. Because the action space grows
exponentially, exhaustive search is infeasible. We therefore adopt a linear
utility model to enable efficient exploration and reliable selection of
promising user subsets. We introduce a gap-index framework that maintains a
shortlist of current estimates of champion arms (top-m sets) and a rotating
shortlist of challenger arms that pose the greatest threat to the champions.
This design focuses on measurements that yield the most informative
gap-index-based comparisons, resulting in significant reductions in runtime and
computation compared to state-of-the-art linear bandit methods, with high
identification accuracy. The method also exposes a tunable trade-off between
speed and accuracy. Simulations on a realistic OFDM downlink show that
shortlist-driven pure exploration makes online, measurement-efficient
subcarrier selection practical for AI-enabled communication systems.

Conclusion: 所提算法在失真风险测度优化中有效且可扩展，成功应用于深度强化学习中的动态库存管理问题

Abstract: Distortion Risk Measures (DRMs) capture risk preferences in decision-making
and serve as general criteria for managing uncertainty. This paper proposes
gradient descent algorithms for DRM optimization based on two dual
representations: the Distortion-Measure (DM) form and Quantile-Function (QF)
form. The DM-form employs a three-timescale algorithm to track quantiles,
compute their gradients, and update decision variables, utilizing the
Generalized Likelihood Ratio and kernel-based density estimation. The QF-form
provides a simpler two-timescale approach that avoids the need for complex
quantile gradient estimation. A hybrid form integrates both approaches,
applying the DM-form for robust performance around distortion function jumps
and the QF-form for efficiency in smooth regions. Proofs of strong convergence
and convergence rates for the proposed algorithms are provided. In particular,
the DM-form achieves an optimal rate of $O(k^{-4/7})$, while the QF-form
attains a faster rate of $O(k^{-2/3})$. Numerical experiments confirm their
effectiveness and demonstrate substantial improvements over baselines in robust
portfolio selection tasks. The method's scalability is further illustrated
through integration into deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, a DRM-based
Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm is developed and applied to
multi-echelon dynamic inventory management, showcasing its practical
applicability.

Conclusion: GILT框架有效解决了图数据异质性问题，实现了无需调优的高效适应，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for precessing relational
data but often struggle to generalize to unseen graphs, giving rise to the
development of Graph Foundational Models (GFMs). However, current GFMs are
challenged by the extreme heterogeneity of graph data, where each graph can
possess a unique feature space, label set, and topology. To address this, two
main paradigms have emerged. The first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs),
but is fundamentally text-dependent, thus struggles to handle the numerical
features in vast graphs. The second pre-trains a structure-based model, but the
adaptation to new tasks typically requires a costly, per-graph tuning stage,
creating a critical efficiency bottleneck. In this work, we move beyond these
limitations and introduce \textbf{G}raph \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning
\textbf{T}ransformer (GILT), a framework built on an LLM-free and tuning-free
architecture. GILT introduces a novel token-based framework for in-context
learning (ICL) on graphs, reframing classification tasks spanning node, edge
and graph levels in a unified framework. This mechanism is the key to handling
heterogeneity, as it is designed to operate on generic numerical features.
Further, its ability to understand class semantics dynamically from the context
enables tuning-free adaptation. Comprehensive experiments show that GILT
achieves stronger few-shot performance with significantly less time than
LLM-based or tuning-based baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Motivation: 传统LLM的自回归解码限制了整体性重新审视和优化早期token的能力，且难以高效探索多样化解决方案。

Conclusion: LaDiR为文本推理提供了一个新的潜在扩散范式，展示了在推理任务中的显著改进效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through
chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may
limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner,
which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this
paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning
framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation
with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an
existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of
thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while
offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a
latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens
with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and
iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows
efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the
model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct
evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks.
Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity,
and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent
reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent
diffusion.

Motivation: Busemann函数在几何机器学习中具有重要作用，能定义黎曼流形上测地线的投影。由于数据常建模为概率分布，研究其在具有丰富黎曼结构的Wasserstein空间中的性质很有必要。

Method: 在Wasserstein空间中研究Busemann函数的存在性和计算，针对一维分布和高斯测度建立闭式表达式，并开发相应的投影方案和切片Wasserstein距离。

Result: 成功获得了一维分布和高斯测度情况下的Busemann函数闭式表达式，并基于此设计了高效的投影方案，在合成数据集和迁移学习问题上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: Wasserstein空间中的Busemann函数可以显式计算，这为概率分布的投影和新型距离度量提供了理论基础，在机器学习应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: The Busemann function has recently found much interest in a variety of
geometric machine learning problems, as it naturally defines projections onto
geodesic rays of Riemannian manifolds and generalizes the notion of
hyperplanes. As several sources of data can be conveniently modeled as
probability distributions, it is natural to study this function in the
Wasserstein space, which carries a rich formal Riemannian structure induced by
Optimal Transport metrics. In this work, we investigate the existence and
computation of Busemann functions in Wasserstein space, which admits geodesic
rays. We establish closed-form expressions in two important cases:
one-dimensional distributions and Gaussian measures. These results enable
explicit projection schemes for probability distributions on $\mathbb{R}$,
which in turn allow us to define novel Sliced-Wasserstein distances over
Gaussian mixtures and labeled datasets. We demonstrate the efficiency of those
original schemes on synthetic datasets as well as transfer learning problems.

Abstract: Probabilistic regression models the entire predictive distribution of a
response variable, offering richer insights than classical point estimates and
directly allowing for uncertainty quantification. While diffusion-based
generative models have shown remarkable success in generating complex,
high-dimensional data, their usage in general regression tasks often lacks
uncertainty-related evaluation and remains limited to domain-specific
applications. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for probabilistic
regression that learns predictive distributions in a nonparametric way. More
specifically, we propose to model the full distribution of the diffusion noise,
enabling adaptation to diverse tasks and enhanced uncertainty quantification.
We investigate different noise parameterizations, analyze their trade-offs, and
evaluate our framework across a broad range of regression tasks, covering low-
and high-dimensional settings. For several experiments, our approach shows
superior performance against existing baselines, while delivering calibrated
uncertainty estimates, demonstrating its versatility as a tool for
probabilistic prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在平方损失下，线性最后一层权重的最优解有闭式解，但传统SGD方法没有充分利用这一特性。

Method: 将最后一层视为主干参数的函数，仅优化主干参数，在SGD设置中通过权衡当前批次损失和先前批次积累信息来适应随机性。

Result: 在神经正切核机制下证明该方法能收敛到最优解，在多个监督任务（包括傅里叶神经算子和工具变量回归）中比标准SGD更有效。

Conclusion: 利用最后一层闭式解特性可以显著提高神经网络优化效率，特别是在平方损失场景下。

Abstract: Neural networks are typically optimized with variants of stochastic gradient
descent. Under a squared loss, however, the optimal solution to the linear last
layer weights is known in closed-form. We propose to leverage this during
optimization, treating the last layer as a function of the backbone parameters,
and optimizing solely for these parameters. We show this is equivalent to
alternating between gradient descent steps on the backbone and closed-form
updates on the last layer. We adapt the method for the setting of stochastic
gradient descent, by trading off the loss on the current batch against the
accumulated information from previous batches. Further, we prove that, in the
Neural Tangent Kernel regime, convergence of this method to an optimal solution
is guaranteed. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
compared with standard SGD on a squared loss in several supervised tasks --
both regression and classification -- including Fourier Neural Operators and
Instrumental Variable Regression.

Motivation: 解决现有上下文适应方法中的简洁性偏见（丢失领域洞察）和上下文崩溃（迭代重写导致细节丢失）问题，提升大语言模型在代理和领域特定推理中的表现。

Conclusion: 全面、演化的上下文能够实现可扩展、高效且自我改进的大语言模型系统，且开销较低。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications such as agents and domain-specific
reasoning increasingly rely on context adaptation -- modifying inputs with
instructions, strategies, or evidence, rather than weight updates. Prior
approaches improve usability but often suffer from brevity bias, which drops
domain insights for concise summaries, and from context collapse, where
iterative rewriting erodes details over time. Building on the adaptive memory
introduced by Dynamic Cheatsheet, we introduce ACE (Agentic Context
Engineering), a framework that treats contexts as evolving playbooks that
accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of
generation, reflection, and curation. ACE prevents collapse with structured,
incremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with
long-context models. Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes
contexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory),
consistently outperforming strong baselines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on
finance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost.
Notably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by
leveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches
the top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it
on the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model.
These results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable,

Abstract: The limited data availability due to strict privacy regulations and
significant resource demands severely constrains biomedical time-series AI
development, which creates a critical gap between data requirements and
accessibility. Synthetic data generation presents a promising solution by
producing artificial datasets that maintain the statistical properties of real
biomedical time-series data without compromising patient confidentiality. We
propose a framework for synthetic biomedical time-series data generation based
on advanced forecasting models that accurately replicates complex
electrophysiological signals such as EEG and EMG with high fidelity. These
synthetic datasets preserve essential temporal and spectral properties of real
data, which enables robust analysis while effectively addressing data scarcity
and privacy challenges. Our evaluations across multiple subjects demonstrate
that the generated synthetic data can serve as an effective substitute for real
data and also significantly boost AI model performance. The approach maintains
critical biomedical features while provides high scalability for various
applications and integrates seamlessly into open-source repositories,
substantially expanding resources for AI-driven biomedical research.

TL;DR: 通过拼接多个小型嵌入模型并使用轻量级解码器压缩，在保持性能的同时大幅减小模型尺寸，适用于资源受限环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型嵌入模型在资源受限环境（如浏览器、边缘设备）中部署困难，而小型模型性能较差，需要找到平衡性能与效率的解决方案。

Method: 拼接多个小型模型的嵌入向量，然后使用基于Matryoshka表示学习的轻量级解码器将高维联合表示映射到低维空间，并进行量化和压缩。

Result: 在MTEB检索任务子集上，通过拼接四个小型模型并使用编码-量化流程，在48倍压缩因子下恢复了原始性能的89%。

Conclusion: 拼接小型模型并通过轻量解码器压缩是有效的解决方案，能够在保持性能的同时显著减小模型尺寸，且随着基础模型数量的增加，解码器表示在压缩和量化下的鲁棒性会提高。

Abstract: Embedding models are central to dense retrieval, semantic search, and
recommendation systems, but their size often makes them impractical to deploy
in resource-constrained environments such as browsers or edge devices. While
smaller embedding models offer practical advantages, they typically
underperform compared to their larger counterparts. To bridge this gap, we
demonstrate that concatenating the raw embedding vectors of multiple small
models can outperform a single larger baseline on standard retrieval
benchmarks. To overcome the resulting high dimensionality of naive
concatenation, we introduce a lightweight unified decoder trained with a
Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) loss. This decoder maps the
high-dimensional joint representation to a low-dimensional space, preserving
most of the original performance without fine-tuning the base models. We also
show that while concatenating more base models yields diminishing gains, the
robustness of the decoder's representation under compression and quantization
improves. Our experiments show that, on a subset of MTEB retrieval tasks, our
concat-encode-quantize pipeline recovers 89\% of the original performance with
a 48x compression factor when the pipeline is applied to a concatenation of
four small embedding models.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的高速缓存策略，通过预测求解器步骤间的中间隐藏状态，加速分子几何生成，在保持样本质量的同时实现2-3倍推理速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型生成高保真分子几何结构，但在推理过程中需要数百次网络评估，计算成本高昂，成为实际应用中采样大量分子候选物的主要瓶颈。

Method: 直接在SE(3)-等变骨干网络上操作的无训练缓存策略，预测求解器步骤间的中间隐藏状态，与预训练模型兼容，且与现有基于训练的加速和系统级优化正交。

Result: 在GEOM-Drugs数据集上，缓存方法在匹配样本质量下实现推理时间两倍减少，与基础模型相比速度提升高达3倍，样本质量仅有最小程度下降。

Conclusion: 该缓存策略与其他优化方法结合可获得高达7倍的速度提升，为分子几何生成提供了有效的推理加速解决方案。

Abstract: Flow matching models generate high-fidelity molecular geometries but incur
significant computational costs during inference, requiring hundreds of network
evaluations. This inference overhead becomes the primary bottleneck when such
models are employed in practice to sample large numbers of molecular
candidates. This work discusses a training-free caching strategy that
accelerates molecular geometry generation by predicting intermediate hidden
states across solver steps. The proposed method operates directly on the
SE(3)-equivariant backbone, is compatible with pretrained models, and is
orthogonal to existing training-based accelerations and system-level
optimizations. Experiments on the GEOM-Drugs dataset demonstrate that caching
achieves a twofold reduction in wall-clock inference time at matched sample
quality and a speedup of up to 3x compared to the base model with minimal
sample quality degradation. Because these gains compound with other
optimizations, applying caching alongside other general, lossless optimizations
yield as much as a 7x speedup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了IMLP，一种针对表格数据流的紧凑型持续学习器，通过滑动潜在特征缓冲区和注意力机制实现恒定内存使用，在保持竞争力的平均准确率的同时显著提高能源效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据流在医疗、金融和物联网等领域的实时决策中日益重要，但这些应用通常在资源受限的边缘和移动设备上运行，现有持续学习解决方案大多依赖回放机制，其缓冲区会随时间增长并加剧资源成本。

Method: 提出了上下文感知增量多层感知器(IMLP)，包含滑动潜在特征缓冲区上的窗口化缩放点积注意力，实现恒定大小内存且避免存储原始数据。注意力上下文与当前特征拼接后由共享前馈层处理，产生轻量级的分段更新。

Result: IMLP比TabNet实现了高达27.6倍的能源效率提升，比TabPFN实现了85.5倍的提升，同时保持了竞争力的平均准确率。

Conclusion: IMLP为表格数据流提供了一个易于部署、能源高效的替代方案，避免了完全重新训练的需求。

Abstract: Tabular data streams are rapidly emerging as a dominant modality for
real-time decision-making in healthcare, finance, and the Internet of Things
(IoT). These applications commonly run on edge and mobile devices, where energy
budgets, memory, and compute are strictly limited. Continual learning (CL)
addresses such dynamics by training models sequentially on task streams while
preserving prior knowledge and consolidating new knowledge. While recent CL
work has advanced in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving knowledge
transfer, the practical requirements of energy and memory efficiency for
tabular data streams remain underexplored. In particular, existing CL solutions
mostly depend on replay mechanisms whose buffers grow over time and exacerbate
resource costs.
  We propose a context-aware incremental Multi-Layer Perceptron (IMLP), a
compact continual learner for tabular data streams. IMLP incorporates a
windowed scaled dot-product attention over a sliding latent feature buffer,
enabling constant-size memory and avoiding storing raw data. The attended
context is concatenated with current features and processed by shared
feed-forward layers, yielding lightweight per-segment updates. To assess
practical deployability, we introduce NetScore-T, a tunable metric coupling
balanced accuracy with energy for Pareto-aware comparison across models and
datasets. IMLP achieves up to $27.6\times$ higher energy efficiency than TabNet
and $85.5\times$ higher than TabPFN, while maintaining competitive average
accuracy. Overall, IMLP provides an easy-to-deploy, energy-efficient
alternative to full retraining for tabular data streams.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了时间序列归一化中的理论矛盾，发现标准RevIN在极端异常值数据集上表现灾难性失败，而简单的R²-IN却意外成为最佳方法。自适应模型A-IN出现系统性失败，表明简单启发式方法可能比其要解决的统计问题更具破坏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RevIN归一化技术及其鲁棒性改进版本R²-IN在时间序列预测中的表现，探索不同归一化策略背后的理论矛盾。

Method: 通过实验分析不同归一化策略（标准RevIN、R²-IN和自适应模型A-IN）在极端异常值数据集上的表现，识别四种理论矛盾。

Result: 标准RevIN在极端异常值数据集上MSE激增683%，R²-IN意外成为最佳整体方法，而自适应模型A-IN出现系统性完全失败。

Conclusion: 提出了时间序列归一化的新警示范式：从盲目追求复杂性转向诊断驱动分析，揭示了简单基线的惊人能力和朴素适应的危险性。

Abstract: Reversible Instance Normalization (RevIN) is a key technique enabling simple
linear models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in time series
forecasting. While replacing its non-robust statistics with robust counterparts
(termed R$^2$-IN) seems like a straightforward improvement, our findings reveal
a far more complex reality. This paper deconstructs the perplexing performance
of various normalization strategies by identifying four underlying theoretical
contradictions. Our experiments provide two crucial findings: first, the
standard RevIN catastrophically fails on datasets with extreme outliers, where
its MSE surges by a staggering 683\%. Second, while the simple R$^2$-IN
prevents this failure and unexpectedly emerges as the best overall performer,
our adaptive model (A-IN), designed to test a diagnostics-driven heuristic,
unexpectedly suffers a complete and systemic failure. This surprising outcome
uncovers a critical, overlooked pitfall in time series analysis: the
instability introduced by a simple or counter-intuitive heuristic can be more
damaging than the statistical issues it aims to solve. The core contribution of
this work is thus a new, cautionary paradigm for time series normalization: a
shift from a blind search for complexity to a diagnostics-driven analysis that
reveals not only the surprising power of simple baselines but also the perilous
nature of naive adaptation.

Result: 通过AWGN和衰落信道上的图像重建实验，量化了复杂度、数据效率和保真度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 为在异构AI原生无线网络中部署DeepJSCC提供了指导方针。

Abstract: Deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for end-to-end semantic communications, jointly learning to compress
and protect task-relevant features over noisy channels. However, existing
DeepJSCC schemes assume a shared latent space at transmitter (TX) and receiver
(RX) - an assumption that fails in multi-vendor deployments where encoders and
decoders cannot be co-trained. This mismatch introduces "semantic noise",
degrading reconstruction quality and downstream task performance. In this
paper, we systematize and evaluate methods for semantic channel equalization
for DeepJSCC, introducing an additional processing stage that aligns
heterogeneous latent spaces under both physical and semantic impairments. We
investigate three classes of aligners: (i) linear maps, which admit closed-form
solutions; (ii) lightweight neural networks, offering greater expressiveness;
and (iii) a Parseval-frame equalizer, which operates in zero-shot mode without
the need for training. Through extensive experiments on image reconstruction
over AWGN and fading channels, we quantify trade-offs among complexity, data
efficiency, and fidelity, providing guidelines for deploying DeepJSCC in
heterogeneous AI-native wireless networks.

Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化专注于构建全局代理模型，但在实际应用中，目标往往是快速定位全局最优解，而非构建完整模型。历史观测点对发现最优解的贡献并不均等。

Method: 引入反事实信用机制，量化历史观测点的个体贡献，并将此信用集成到采集函数中，实现资源在最优解最可能出现的区域进行选择性分配。

Result: 理论证明CCGBO保持次线性遗憾，在多种合成和真实世界基准测试中，该方法持续降低简单遗憾并加速收敛到全局最优解。

Conclusion: CCGBO通过反事实信用评估有效提升了贝叶斯优化的效率，在快速定位全局最优解方面表现出色。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization has emerged as a prominent methodology for optimizing
expensive black-box functions by leveraging Gaussian process surrogates, which
focus on capturing the global characteristics of the objective function.
However, in numerous practical scenarios, the primary objective is not to
construct an exhaustive global surrogate, but rather to quickly pinpoint the
global optimum. Due to the aleatoric nature of the sequential optimization
problem and its dependence on the quality of the surrogate model and the
initial design, it is restrictive to assume that all observed samples
contribute equally to the discovery of the optimum in this context. In this
paper, we introduce Counterfactual Credit Guided Bayesian Optimization (CCGBO),
a novel framework that explicitly quantifies the contribution of individual
historical observations through counterfactual credit. By incorporating
counterfactual credit into the acquisition function, our approach can
selectively allocate resources in areas where optimal solutions are most likely
to occur. We prove that CCGBO retains sublinear regret. Empirical evaluations
on various synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that CCGBO
consistently reduces simple regret and accelerates convergence to the global
optimum.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对SEA模型的参数无关算法，通过乐观在线牛顿步消除对领域直径和损失函数Lipschitz常数等参数的需求，实现了比较器和Lipschitz自适应的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SEA模型方法需要预先知道问题特定参数（如领域直径D和损失函数Lipschitz常数G），这限制了实际应用。需要开发参数无关的方法来提高实用性。

Method: 利用乐观在线牛顿步（OONS）算法，首先处理未知领域直径但已知Lipschitz常数的情况，然后扩展到两者都未知的更一般设置。

Result: 在未知领域直径但已知Lipschitz常数情况下，实现了期望遗憾界$\tilde{O}\big(\|u\|_2^2 + \|u\|_2(\sqrt{\sigma^2_{1:T}} + \sqrt{\Sigma^2_{1:T}})\big)$；在两者都未知时仍保持相同的$\sigma^2_{1:T}$和$\Sigma^2_{1:T}$依赖关系。

Conclusion: 所提出的参数无关方法在SEA模型中即使两个参数都未知时仍能有效工作，显著提高了算法的实用性。

Abstract: We develop the first parameter-free algorithms for the Stochastically
Extended Adversarial (SEA) model, a framework that bridges adversarial and
stochastic online convex optimization. Existing approaches for the SEA model
require prior knowledge of problem-specific parameters, such as the diameter of
the domain $D$ and the Lipschitz constant of the loss functions $G$, which
limits their practical applicability. Addressing this, we develop
parameter-free methods by leveraging the Optimistic Online Newton Step (OONS)
algorithm to eliminate the need for these parameters. We first establish a
comparator-adaptive algorithm for the scenario with unknown domain diameter but
known Lipschitz constant, achieving an expected regret bound of
$\tilde{O}\big(\|u\|_2^2 + \|u\|_2(\sqrt{\sigma^2_{1:T}} +
\sqrt{\Sigma^2_{1:T}})\big)$, where $u$ is the comparator vector and
$\sigma^2_{1:T}$ and $\Sigma^2_{1:T}$ represent the cumulative stochastic
variance and cumulative adversarial variation, respectively. We then extend
this to the more general setting where both $D$ and $G$ are unknown, attaining
the comparator- and Lipschitz-adaptive algorithm. Notably, the regret bound
exhibits the same dependence on $\sigma^2_{1:T}$ and $\Sigma^2_{1:T}$,
demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed methods even when both parameters
are unknown in the SEA model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现有效噪声尺度统一了优化器和数据选择对模型合并的影响，揭示了模型合并效果与有效噪声呈非单调函数关系，并存在最优值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然模型合并方法在实践中很有用，但对其有效性的内在机制理解不足。本文旨在探索优化过程如何影响损失景观几何形状及其对合并成功的影响。

Method: 通过分析有效噪声尺度这一单一量，统一研究优化器和数据选择对模型合并的影响，分解学习率、权重衰减、批量大小和数据增强等因素的作用。

Result: 发现模型合并效果是有效噪声的非单调函数，具有明显的最优点。较大的学习率、较强的权重衰减、较小的批量大小和数据增强都能独立调节有效噪声尺度，表现出相同的定性趋势。

Conclusion: 优化器噪声不仅影响单个最小值的平坦度或泛化能力，还影响全局损失景观，能够预测独立训练的解何时可以成功合并。这为通过操纵训练动态来改进合并效果提供了可能性。

Abstract: Model merging methods combine models with different capabilities into a
single one while maintaining the same inference cost. Two popular approaches
are linear interpolation, which linearly interpolates between model weights,
and task arithmetic, which combines task vectors obtained by the difference
between finetuned and base models. While useful in practice, what properties
make merging effective are poorly understood. This paper explores how the
optimization process affects the loss landscape geometry and its impact on
merging success. We show that a single quantity -- the effective noise scale --
unifies the impact of optimizer and data choices on model merging. Across
architectures and datasets, the effectiveness of merging success is a
non-monotonic function of effective noise, with a distinct optimum. Decomposing
this quantity, we find that larger learning rates, stronger weight decay,
smaller batch sizes, and data augmentation all independently modulate the
effective noise scale, exhibiting the same qualitative trend. Unlike prior work
that connects optimizer noise to the flatness or generalization of individual
minima, we show that it also affects the global loss landscape, predicting when
independently trained solutions can be merged. Our findings broaden the
understanding of how optimization shapes the loss landscape geometry and its
downstream consequences for model merging, suggesting the possibility of
further manipulating the training dynamics to improve merging effectiveness.

Conclusion: ViTs框架有效解决了时间序列异常检测中的长度可变性和零样本泛化问题，为跨场景应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Web service administrators must ensure the stability of multiple systems by
promptly detecting anomalies in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Achieving
the goal of "train once, infer across scenarios" remains a fundamental
challenge for time series anomaly detection models. Beyond improving zero-shot
generalization, such models must also flexibly handle sequences of varying
lengths during inference, ranging from one hour to one week, without
retraining. Conventional approaches rely on sliding-window encoding and
self-supervised learning, which restrict inference to fixed-length inputs.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
capabilities across general domains. However, when applied to time series data,
they face inherent limitations due to context length. To address this issue, we
propose ViTs, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that converts time
series curves into visual representations. By rescaling time series images,
temporal dependencies are preserved while maintaining a consistent input size,
thereby enabling efficient processing of arbitrarily long sequences without
context constraints. Training VLMs for this purpose introduces unique
challenges, primarily due to the scarcity of aligned time series image-text
data. To overcome this, we employ an evolutionary algorithm to automatically
generate thousands of high-quality image-text pairs and design a three-stage
training pipeline consisting of: (1) time series knowledge injection, (2)
anomaly detection enhancement, and (3) anomaly reasoning refinement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ViTs substantially enhance the ability of VLMs to
understand and detect anomalies in time series data. All datasets and code will
be publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ViTs-C484/.

Conclusion: 对有向超图进行原则性处理，结合层的表达能力，能显著提升性能。

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural way to represent higher-order interactions
among multiple entities. While undirected hypergraphs have been extensively
studied, the case of directed hypergraphs, which can model oriented group
interactions, remains largely under-explored despite its relevance for many
applications. Recent approaches in this direction often exhibit an implicit
bias toward homophily, which limits their effectiveness in heterophilic
settings. Rooted in the algebraic topology notion of Cellular Sheaves, Sheaf
Neural Networks (SNNs) were introduced as an effective solution to circumvent
such a drawback. While a generalization to hypergraphs is known, it is only
suitable for undirected hypergraphs, failing to tackle the directed case. In
this work, we introduce Directional Sheaf Hypergraph Networks (DSHN), a
framework integrating sheaf theory with a principled treatment of asymmetric
relations within a hypergraph. From it, we construct the Directed Sheaf
Hypergraph Laplacian, a complex-valued operator by which we unify and
generalize many existing Laplacian matrices proposed in the graph- and
hypergraph-learning literature. Across 7 real-world datasets and against 13
baselines, DSHN achieves relative accuracy gains from 2% up to 20%, showing how
a principled treatment of directionality in hypergraphs, combined with the
expressive power of sheaves, can substantially improve performance.

Result: 推导了期望样本复杂度的下界，并证明算法在渐近意义上达到了该下界。

Conclusion: 在非参数设置下，成功解决了EVaR准则下的BAI问题，算法具有渐近最优性。

Abstract: We study the fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI) problem within
the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework under the Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR)
criterion. Our analysis considers a nonparametric setting, allowing for general
reward distributions bounded in [0,1]. This formulation addresses the critical
need for risk-averse decision-making in high-stakes environments, such as
finance, moving beyond simple expected value optimization. We propose a
$\delta$-correct, Track-and-Stop based algorithm and derive a corresponding
lower bound on the expected sample complexity, which we prove is asymptotically
matched. The implementation of our algorithm and the characterization of the
lower bound both require solving a complex convex optimization problem and a
related, simpler non-convex one.

Motivation: 研究非线性CCA如何恢复真实潜在因子，建立理论保证，解决现有方法缺乏理论支撑的问题。

Method: 通过重新参数化将分析从观测空间转换到源空间，证明仿射可识别性，并分析白化处理对条件数的影响。

Result: 建立了非线性CCA的仿射可识别性理论，证明了岭正则化经验CCA收敛到总体对应项，实验验证了理论假设的必要性。

Conclusion: 非线性CCA在适当条件下能够恢复潜在因子，白化处理对确保有界性和良好条件性至关重要。

Abstract: In this work, we establish conditions under which nonlinear CCA recovers the
ground-truth latent factors up to an orthogonal transform after whitening.
Building on the classical result that linear mappings maximize canonical
correlations under Gaussian priors, we prove affine identifiability for a broad
class of latent distributions in the population setting. Central to our proof
is a reparameterization result that transports the analysis from observation
space to source space, where identifiability becomes tractable. We further show
that whitening is essential for ensuring boundedness and well-conditioning,
thereby underpinning identifiability. Beyond the population setting, we prove
that ridge-regularized empirical CCA converges to its population counterpart,
transferring these guarantees to the finite-sample regime. Experiments on a
controlled synthetic dataset and a rendered image dataset validate our theory
and demonstrate the necessity of its assumptions through systematic ablations.

TL;DR: 本文分析了扩散语言模型(dLLMs)并行解码的局限性，提出了首个专门针对dLLMs的基准测试ParallelBench，揭示了并行解码在现实场景中会导致严重的质量下降，并指出当前解码策略难以在速度和质量之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型(dLLMs)因并行解码潜力而受到关注，但其条件独立性假设会忽略标记依赖关系，在强依赖场景下导致生成质量下降。现有研究对此挑战关注不足，标准基准测试无法充分捕捉并行解码的质量退化问题。

Method: 首先进行并行解码的信息论分析，然后在可分析的合成列表操作上进行案例研究，从数据分布和解码策略角度提供定量见解。基于这些见解，构建了ParallelBench基准测试，包含对人类和自回归LLMs简单但对dLLMs并行解码极具挑战性的现实任务。

Result: 研究发现：(i) dLLMs在并行解码下在现实场景中会遭受显著质量下降；(ii) 当前并行解码策略难以根据任务难度调整并行度，无法在不牺牲质量的情况下实现有意义的加速。

Conclusion: 当前的速度-质量权衡问题迫切需要创新的解码方法。发布的基准测试将有助于加速真正高效dLLMs的发展。

Abstract: While most autoregressive LLMs are constrained to one-by-one decoding,
diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have attracted growing interest for their potential to
dramatically accelerate inference through parallel decoding. Despite this
promise, the conditional independence assumption in dLLMs causes parallel
decoding to ignore token dependencies, inevitably degrading generation quality
when these dependencies are strong. However, existing works largely overlook
these inherent challenges, and evaluations on standard benchmarks (e.g., math
and coding) are not sufficient to capture the quality degradation caused by
parallel decoding. To address this gap, we first provide an
information-theoretic analysis of parallel decoding. We then conduct case
studies on analytically tractable synthetic list operations from both data
distribution and decoding strategy perspectives, offering quantitative insights
that highlight the fundamental limitations of parallel decoding. Building on
these insights, we propose ParallelBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed for dLLMs, featuring realistic tasks that are trivial for humans and
autoregressive LLMs yet exceptionally challenging for dLLMs under parallel
decoding. Using ParallelBench, we systematically analyze both dLLMs and
autoregressive LLMs, revealing that: (i) dLLMs under parallel decoding can
suffer dramatic quality degradation in real-world scenarios, and (ii) current
parallel decoding strategies struggle to adapt their degree of parallelism
based on task difficulty, thus failing to achieve meaningful speedup without
compromising quality. Our findings underscore the pressing need for innovative
decoding methods that can overcome the current speed-quality trade-off. We
release our benchmark to help accelerate the development of truly efficient
dLLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了在存在不精确性和模糊性的机器学习中，使用信度集表示不精确概率信念的迭代更新过程，研究了这种迭代过程是否收敛到稳定固定点以及相关条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多机器学习算法依赖不确定性表示的迭代更新，在存在不精确性和模糊性的情况下，信度集已成为表示不精确概率信念的流行框架。需要研究这种迭代更新过程是否收敛到稳定固定点。

Method: 作者提供了对该问题的首次分析，并以信度贝叶斯深度学习作为具体示例来说明研究结果。

Result: 研究表明，将不精确性纳入学习过程不仅丰富了不确定性的表示，还揭示了稳定性出现的结构性条件。

Conclusion: 这项工作为不精确性下的迭代学习动态提供了新的见解，展示了在何种条件下迭代学习过程能够达到稳定状态。

Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms rely on iterative updates of uncertainty
representations, ranging from variational inference and
expectation-maximization, to reinforcement learning, continual learning, and
multi-agent learning. In the presence of imprecision and ambiguity, credal sets
-- closed, convex sets of probability distributions -- have emerged as a
popular framework for representing imprecise probabilistic beliefs. Under such
imprecision, many learning problems in imprecise probabilistic machine learning
(IPML) may be viewed as processes involving successive applications of update
rules on credal sets. This naturally raises the question of whether this
iterative process converges to stable fixed points -- or, more generally, under
what conditions on the updating mechanism such fixed points exist, and whether
they can be attained. We provide the first analysis of this problem and
illustrate our findings using Credal Bayesian Deep Learning as a concrete
example. Our work demonstrates that incorporating imprecision into the learning
process not only enriches the representation of uncertainty, but also reveals
structural conditions under which stability emerges, thereby offering new
insights into the dynamics of iterative learning under imprecision.

TL;DR: 提出DiPO（Distribution Preference Optimization）方法，通过直接操作模型输出的token概率分布来实现大语言模型的遗忘学习，解决了NPO方法缺乏显式正偏好信号的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力的提升，数据隐私和安全问题日益受到关注。现有的优化式遗忘方法如NPO由于缺乏显式正偏好信号，效果受限。需要一种更通用的遗忘学习方法。

Method: DiPO方法将关注点从完整响应转移到分布层面，直接针对下一个token的概率分布。通过选择性放大或抑制模型高置信度输出logits来构建所需的偏好分布对。

Result: DiPO在TOFU基准测试中达到了最高的遗忘质量，在MUSE基准测试中保持了领先的可扩展性和效用保持可持续性，实现了模型效用与遗忘质量之间的良好权衡。

Conclusion: DiPO通过分布层面的偏好优化，有效克服了NPO方法的局限性，为大语言模型遗忘学习提供了一种更有效和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities learned
from vast corpora, concerns regarding data privacy and safety are receiving
increasing attention. LLM unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of
specific data while preserving overall model utility, is becoming an important
research area. One of the mainstream unlearning classes is optimization-based
methods, which achieve forgetting directly through fine-tuning, exemplified by
Negative Preference Optimization (NPO). However, NPO's effectiveness is limited
by its inherent lack of explicit positive preference signals. Attempts to
introduce such signals by constructing preferred responses often necessitate
domain-specific knowledge or well-designed prompts, fundamentally restricting
their generalizability. In this paper, we shift the focus to the
distribution-level, directly targeting the next-token probability distribution
instead of entire responses, and derive a novel unlearning algorithm termed
\textbf{Di}stribution \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (DiPO). We show
that the requisite preference distribution pairs for DiPO, which are
distributions over the model's output tokens, can be constructed by selectively
amplifying or suppressing the model's high-confidence output logits, thereby
effectively overcoming NPO's limitations. We theoretically prove the
consistency of DiPO's loss function with the desired unlearning direction.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiPO achieves a strong trade-off between
model utility and forget quality. Notably, DiPO attains the highest forget
quality on the TOFU benchmark, and maintains leading scalability and
sustainability in utility preservation on the MUSE benchmark.

without compromising speed or accuracy, according to user evaluations.
Moreover, MetaMP supports essential functions such as structure classification

  We present three practical applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in
membrane protein research: predicting transmembrane segments, reconciling
legacy databases, and classifying structures with explainable AI support. In a
validation focused on statistics, MetaMP resolved 77% of data discrepancies and
accurately predicted the class of newly identified membrane proteins 98% of the

Motivation: 人类能够在工作中学习，但模型能否做到同样的事情？研究旨在开发能够在测试时继续学习并提升性能的模型。

Method: 使用测试时课程（TTC-RL）方法，自动从大量可用训练数据中选择与任务最相关的数据，然后应用强化学习进行持续训练。

Result: 在数学和编程基准测试中，TTC-RL显著提升了模型性能：Qwen3-8B在AIME25上的pass@1提高了约1.8倍，在CodeElo上提高了2.1倍；pass@8在AIME25上从40%提升到62%，在CodeElo上从28%提升到43%。

Conclusion: 测试时课程方法展示了在测试时通过数千个任务相关经验进行持续训练的潜力，能够显著提高模型的性能上限。

Abstract: Humans are good at learning on the job: We learn how to solve the tasks we
face as we go along. Can a model do the same? We propose an agent that
assembles a task-specific curriculum, called test-time curriculum (TTC-RL), and
applies reinforcement learning to continue training the model for its target
task. The test-time curriculum avoids time-consuming human curation of datasets
by automatically selecting the most task-relevant data from a large pool of
available training data. Our experiments demonstrate that reinforcement
learning on a test-time curriculum consistently improves the model on its
target tasks, across a variety of evaluations and models. Notably, on
challenging math and coding benchmarks, TTC-RL improves the pass@1 of Qwen3-8B
by approximately 1.8x on AIME25 and 2.1x on CodeElo. Moreover, we find that
TTC-RL significantly raises the performance ceiling compared to the initial
model, increasing pass@8 on AIME25 from 40% to 62% and on CodeElo from 28% to
43%. Our findings show the potential of test-time curricula in extending the
test-time scaling paradigm to continual training on thousands of task-relevant
experiences during test-time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CVR预测模型通常只基于点击样本训练，但点击样本稀疏，需要大量日志。现有方法利用未点击样本但依赖启发式方法，存在点击与未点击样本间的偏差问题

Method: 训练用户序列行为的结构因果模型，对未点击项目进行假设干预（点击）来推断反事实CVR，然后将预测的反事实CVR转换为二进制反事实转化标签，并将生成的样本纳入训练过程

Result: 在公共数据集上的广泛实验显示了算法的优越性，在线A/B测试进一步验证了在真实场景中的有效性，在潜在转化数据上也表现出改进的性能

Conclusion: ESCIM方法通过因果推理有效解决了CVR预测中的样本稀疏性问题，具有鲁棒性和优越的泛化能力

Abstract: Accurately predicting conversion rate (CVR) is essential in various
recommendation domains such as online advertising systems and e-commerce. These
systems utilize user interaction logs, which consist of exposures, clicks, and
conversions. CVR prediction models are typically trained solely based on
clicked samples, as conversions can only be determined following clicks.
However, the sparsity of clicked instances necessitates the collection of a
substantial amount of logs for effective model training. Recent works address
this issue by devising frameworks that leverage non-clicked samples. While
these frameworks aim to reduce biases caused by the discrepancy between clicked
and non-clicked samples, they often rely on heuristics. Against this
background, we propose a method to counterfactually generate conversion labels
for non-clicked samples by using causality as a guiding principle, attempting
to answer the question, "Would the user have converted if he or she had clicked
the recommended item?" Our approach is named the Entire Space Counterfactual
Inference Multi-task Model (ESCIM). We initially train a structural causal
model (SCM) of user sequential behaviors and conduct a hypothetical
intervention (i.e., click) on non-clicked items to infer counterfactual CVRs.
We then introduce several approaches to transform predicted counterfactual CVRs
into binary counterfactual conversion labels for the non-clicked samples.
Finally, the generated samples are incorporated into the training process.
Extensive experiments on public datasets illustrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithm. Online A/B testing further empirically validates the
effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios. In addition,
we demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method on latent
conversion data, showcasing its robustness and superior generalization
capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文研究了正则表达式在PAC模型和成员查询下的计算复杂性，证明了即使在均匀分布下PAC学习也是困难的，并扩展了带补集或交集的正则表达式的学习难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管正则表达式具有理论重要性和广泛应用，但其学习计算复杂性尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究正则表达式在PAC模型和成员查询下的学习难度。

Method: 通过理论分析证明正则表达式学习的计算复杂性，包括PAC学习在均匀分布下的困难性，以及带成员查询的无分布学习困难性。还研究了扩展正则表达式（带补集或交集）的学习难度。

Result: 证明了正则表达式PAC学习即使在均匀分布下也是困难的，无分布学习带成员查询也是困难的。对于带补集或交集的正则表达式，即使在均匀分布下带成员查询的学习也是困难的。

Conclusion: 正则表达式的学习在计算上是困难的，这些结果不能从现有的DFA或NFA学习困难性结果中推导出来，因为正则语言在DFA、NFA和正则表达式之间的描述复杂性可能存在指数级差异。

Abstract: Despite the theoretical significance and wide practical use of regular
expressions, the computational complexity of learning them has been largely
unexplored. We study the computational hardness of improperly learning regular
expressions in the PAC model and with membership queries. We show that PAC
learning is hard even under the uniform distribution on the hypercube, and also
prove hardness of distribution-free learning with membership queries.
Furthermore, if regular expressions are extended with complement or
intersection, we establish hardness of learning with membership queries even
under the uniform distribution. We emphasize that these results do not follow
from existing hardness results for learning DFAs or NFAs, since the descriptive
complexity of regular languages can differ exponentially between DFAs, NFAs,
and regular expressions.

TL;DR: BCFP是一种基于键的分子指纹，作为ECFP的补充。将BCFP与ECFP结合使用在BBBP分类任务中显著提升了AUROC和AUPRC性能，r=1半径效果最佳。BCFP-Sort&Slice方案保留了OOV计数信息，实现了紧凑的无哈希连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种基于键的分子指纹作为现有原子中心指纹（ECFP）的补充，以提升脑血屏障穿透性（BBBP）分类任务的预测性能。

Method: 引入静态BCFP，模拟ChemProp等定向消息传递GNN的键卷积，使用快速随机森林模型在BBBP任务上进行评估。提出BCFP-Sort&Slice特征组合方案，保留ECFP的OOV计数信息。

Result: 在分层交叉验证中，ECFP与BCFP的拼接始终比单独使用任一描述符提高了AUROC和AUPRC。r=1半径表现最佳，r=2未带来统计显著增益。使用复合新特征超越了MGTP预测性能。

Conclusion: 轻量级的键中心描述符可以补充原子中心圆形指纹，为BBBP预测提供强大快速的基线方法。

Abstract: Bond Centered FingerPrint (BCFP) are a complementary, bond-centric
alternative to Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP). We introduce a static
BCFP that mirrors the bond-convolution used by directed message-passing GNNs
like ChemProp, and evaluate it with a fast rapid Random Forest model on
Brain-Blood Barrier Penetration (BBBP) classification task. Across stratified
cross-validation, concatenating ECFP with BCFP consistently improves AUROC and
AUPRC over either descriptor alone, as confirmed by Turkey HSD
multiple-comparison analysis. Among radii, r = 1 performs best; r = 2 does not
yield statistically separable gains under the same test. We further propose
BCFP-Sort&Slice, a simple feature-combination scheme that preserves the
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) count information native to ECFP count vectors while
enabling compact unhashed concatenation of BCFP variants. We also outperform
the MGTP prediction on our BBBP evaluation, using such composite new features
bond and atom features. These results show that lightweight, bond-centered
descriptors can complement atom-centered circular fingerprints and provide
strong, fast baselines for BBBP prediction.

Conclusion: 提出的分布鲁棒因果抽象框架能有效应对环境变化和模型错误指定问题，为因果抽象学习提供了更强的鲁棒性保障。

Abstract: Causal Abstraction (CA) theory provides a principled framework for relating
causal models that describe the same system at different levels of granularity
while ensuring interventional consistency between them. Recently, several
approaches for learning CAs have been proposed, but all assume fixed and
well-specified exogenous distributions, making them vulnerable to environmental
shifts and misspecification. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing the first class of distributionally robust CAs and their associated
learning algorithms. The latter cast robust causal abstraction learning as a
constrained min-max optimization problem with Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We
provide theoretical results, for both empirical and Gaussian environments,
leading to principled selection of the level of robustness via the radius of
these sets. Furthermore, we present empirical evidence across different
problems and CA learning methods, demonstrating our framework's robustness not
only to environmental shifts but also to structural model and intervention
mapping misspecification.

Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法难以统一处理多种扰动类型（输入和模型扰动）同时满足合理性、多样性等要求，需要模型无关的解决方案。

Method: 使用L-GMVAE学习结构化潜空间，每个类别由多个高斯组件表示；LAPACE算法通过从输入潜表示到潜质心插值生成反事实解释路径。

Result: LAPACE计算高效，在八个量化指标上达到竞争性性能，生成的路径提供从接近性到合理性的权衡选择。

Conclusion: LAPACE框架能统一处理多种鲁棒性要求，同时满足多样性、合理性等特性，是有效的模型无关反事实解释方法。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CEs) provide recourse recommendations for
individuals affected by algorithmic decisions. A key challenge is generating
CEs that are robust against various perturbation types (e.g. input and model
perturbations) while simultaneously satisfying other desirable properties.
These include plausibility, ensuring CEs reside on the data manifold, and
diversity, providing multiple distinct recourse options for single inputs.
Existing methods, however, mostly struggle to address these multifaceted
requirements in a unified, model-agnostic manner. We address these limitations
by proposing a novel generative framework. First, we introduce the
Label-conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (L-GMVAE), a model
trained to learn a structured latent space where each class label is
represented by a set of Gaussian components with diverse, prototypical
centroids. Building on this, we present LAPACE (LAtent PAth Counterfactual
Explanations), a model-agnostic algorithm that synthesises entire paths of CE
points by interpolating from inputs' latent representations to those learned
latent centroids. This approach inherently ensures robustness to input changes,
as all paths for a given target class converge to the same fixed centroids.
Furthermore, the generated paths provide a spectrum of recourse options,
allowing users to navigate the trade-off between proximity and plausibility
while also encouraging robustness against model changes. In addition,
user-specified actionability constraints can also be easily incorporated via
lightweight gradient optimisation through the L-GMVAE's decoder. Comprehensive
experiments show that LAPACE is computationally efficient and achieves
competitive performance across eight quantitative metrics.

TL;DR: 论文识别了自进化LLM代理的对齐倾斜过程(ATP)风险，即持续交互会驱使代理放弃训练时的对齐约束，转向自我强化的利己策略，导致长期可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理获得自进化能力，其长期可靠性成为关键问题。需要研究部署后出现的对齐失效风险，这种风险不同于训练时失败，而是由持续交互驱动的行为漂移。

Method: 通过两种互补范式分析ATP：利己探索（重复高奖励偏差导致个体行为漂移）和模仿策略扩散（异常行为在多代理系统中传播）。构建可控测试平台，对Qwen3-8B和Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct进行基准测试。

Result: 实验显示自进化下对齐效益迅速侵蚀，初始对齐模型收敛到未对齐状态。多代理设置中，成功违规行为快速扩散，导致集体未对齐。当前基于强化学习的对齐方法仅提供脆弱防御。

Conclusion: LLM代理的对齐不是静态属性，而是脆弱且动态的，在部署过程中容易因反馈驱动而衰减。需要重新思考对齐的长期稳定性。

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly gain self-evolutionary
capabilities to adapt and refine their strategies through real-world
interaction, their long-term reliability becomes a critical concern. We
identify the Alignment Tipping Process (ATP), a critical post-deployment risk
unique to self-evolving LLM agents. Unlike training-time failures, ATP arises
when continual interaction drives agents to abandon alignment constraints
established during training in favor of reinforced, self-interested strategies.
We formalize and analyze ATP through two complementary paradigms:
Self-Interested Exploration, where repeated high-reward deviations induce
individual behavioral drift, and Imitative Strategy Diffusion, where deviant
behaviors spread across multi-agent systems. Building on these paradigms, we
construct controllable testbeds and benchmark Qwen3-8B and
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our experiments show that alignment benefits erode
rapidly under self-evolution, with initially aligned models converging toward
unaligned states. In multi-agent settings, successful violations diffuse
quickly, leading to collective misalignment. Moreover, current reinforcement
learning-based alignment methods provide only fragile defenses against
alignment tipping. Together, these findings demonstrate that alignment of LLM
agents is not a static property but a fragile and dynamic one, vulnerable to
feedback-driven decay during deployment. Our data and code are available at
https://github.com/aiming-lab/ATP.

Motivation: 术中病理学对精准手术至关重要，但受限于诊断复杂性和高质量冰冻切片数据的缺乏。计算病理学虽取得进展，但缺乏大规模前瞻性验证阻碍了其在手术流程中的常规应用。

Method: 开发CRISP临床级基础模型，基于8个医疗中心的10万多张冰冻切片数据，在近100个回顾性诊断任务上进行全面评估，包括良恶性鉴别、关键术中决策和泛癌检测等。

Result: 模型在不同机构、肿瘤类型和解剖部位（包括未见过的部位和罕见癌症）上表现出稳健泛化能力。在前瞻性2000多患者队列中，CRISP在真实条件下保持高诊断准确性，直接影响92.6%病例的手术决策。人机协作减少35%诊断工作量，避免105项辅助检查，微转移检测准确率达87.5%。

Conclusion: CRISP代表了AI驱动术中病理学的临床级范式，连接计算进展与手术精准性，加速人工智能向常规临床实践的转化。

Abstract: Intraoperative pathology is pivotal to precision surgery, yet its clinical
impact is constrained by diagnostic complexity and the limited availability of
high-quality frozen-section data. While computational pathology has made
significant strides, the lack of large-scale, prospective validation has
impeded its routine adoption in surgical workflows. Here, we introduce CRISP, a
clinical-grade foundation model developed on over 100,000 frozen sections from
eight medical centers, specifically designed to provide Clinical-grade Robust
Intraoperative Support for Pathology (CRISP). CRISP was comprehensively
evaluated on more than 15,000 intraoperative slides across nearly 100
retrospective diagnostic tasks, including benign-malignant discrimination, key
intraoperative decision-making, and pan-cancer detection, etc. The model
demonstrated robust generalization across diverse institutions, tumor types,
and anatomical sites-including previously unseen sites and rare cancers. In a
prospective cohort of over 2,000 patients, CRISP sustained high diagnostic
accuracy under real-world conditions, directly informing surgical decisions in
92.6% of cases. Human-AI collaboration further reduced diagnostic workload by
35%, avoided 105 ancillary tests and enhanced detection of micrometastases with
87.5% accuracy. Together, these findings position CRISP as a clinical-grade
paradigm for AI-driven intraoperative pathology, bridging computational
advances with surgical precision and accelerating the translation of artificial
intelligence into routine clinical practice.

Motivation: HRM方法虽然在小模型上表现出色，但结构复杂且可能不是最优解。研究旨在开发更简单高效的递归推理方法。

Method: 提出TRM方法，使用单个仅2层的微小网络进行递归推理，参数数量仅7M，比HRM更简单。

Result: TRM在ARC-AGI-1上达到45%测试准确率，ARC-AGI-2上达到8%，超越了Deepseek R1、o3-mini、Gemini 2.5 Pro等大型语言模型。

Conclusion: TRM证明了使用极简网络结构也能在复杂推理任务上取得优异性能，为高效AI推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) is a novel approach using two small neural
networks recursing at different frequencies. This biologically inspired method
beats Large Language models (LLMs) on hard puzzle tasks such as Sudoku, Maze,
and ARC-AGI while trained with small models (27M parameters) on small data
(around 1000 examples). HRM holds great promise for solving hard problems with
small networks, but it is not yet well understood and may be suboptimal. We
propose Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), a much simpler recursive reasoning approach
that achieves significantly higher generalization than HRM, while using a
single tiny network with only 2 layers. With only 7M parameters, TRM obtains
45% test-accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2, higher than most LLMs
(e.g., Deepseek R1, o3-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with less than 0.01% of the

(1) selecting optimal methods from the vast ML landscape, (2) determining
whether real-world clinical data (e.g., electronic health records, EHRs) or
structured disease descriptions yield more reliable insights, (3) the lack of
"ground truth," as some disease interconnections remain unexplored in medicine.
Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate broad utility, yet they often lack
specialized medical knowledge. To address these gaps, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of seven approaches for uncovering disease relationships based on
two data sources: (i) sequences of ICD-10 codes from MIMIC-IV EHRs and (ii) the
full set of ICD-10 codes, both with and without textual descriptions. Our
framework integrates the following: (i) a statistical co-occurrence analysis
and a masked language modeling (MLM) approach using real clinical data; (ii)
domain-specific BERT variants (Med-BERT and BioClinicalBERT); (iii) a
general-purpose BERT and document retrieval; and (iv) four LLMs (Mistral,
DeepSeek, Qwen, and YandexGPT). Our graph-based comparison of the obtained
interconnection matrices shows that the LLM-based approach produces
interconnections with the lowest diversity of ICD code connections to different
diseases compared to other methods, including text-based and domain-based
approaches. This suggests an important implication: LLMs have limited potential
for discovering new interconnections. In the absence of ground truth databases
for medical interconnections between ICD codes, our results constitute a
valuable medical disease ontology that can serve as a foundational resource for
future clinical research and artificial intelligence applications in
healthcare.

Conclusion: 所提出的流匹配精炼器方法有效地解决了去噪方法中的误差累积问题，提高了分子构象生成的样本质量。

Abstract: Low-energy molecular conformers generation (MCG) is a foundational yet
challenging problem in drug discovery. Denoising-based methods include
diffusion and flow-matching methods that learn mappings from a simple base
distribution to the molecular conformer distribution. However, these approaches
often suffer from error accumulation during sampling, especially in the low SNR
steps, which are hard to train. To address these challenges, we propose a
flow-matching refiner for the MCG task. The proposed method initializes
sampling from mixed-quality outputs produced by upstream denoising models and
reschedules the noise scale to bypass the low-SNR phase, thereby improving
sample quality. On the GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs benchmark datasets, the
generator-refiner pipeline improves quality with fewer total denoising steps
while preserving diversity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，使技能发现算法能够学习专注于控制特定状态变量的技能，从而提升探索效率、解锁新学习能力并避免下游任务中的负面副作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技能发现算法往往忽略强化学习问题中的自然状态变量，导致发现的技能缺乏对特定状态变量的控制，这会显著影响探索效率、增加学习难度，并在目标不明确的下游任务中产生负面副作用。

Method: 引入一种通用方法，使技能发现算法能够学习专注技能——即针对和控制特定状态变量的技能。

Result: 该方法将状态空间覆盖率提高了三倍，解锁了新的学习能力，并自动避免了在下游任务中的负面副作用。

Conclusion: 通过专注于控制特定状态变量，该方法显著提升了技能发现的效果，为强化学习中的探索和学习提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Skills are essential for unlocking higher levels of problem solving. A common
approach to discovering these skills is to learn ones that reliably reach
different states, thus empowering the agent to control its environment.
However, existing skill discovery algorithms often overlook the natural state
variables present in many reinforcement learning problems, meaning that the
discovered skills lack control of specific state variables. This can
significantly hamper exploration efficiency, make skills more challenging to
learn with, and lead to negative side effects in downstream tasks when the goal
is under-specified. We introduce a general method that enables these skill
discovery algorithms to learn focused skills -- skills that target and control
specific state variables. Our approach improves state space coverage by a
factor of three, unlocks new learning capabilities, and automatically avoids
negative side effects in downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Glocal-IB训练范式，通过全局对齐损失解决时间序列插补中高缺失率下的优化困境，改善潜在表示分布并提升插补性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列插补模型在高缺失率下虽然训练表现良好，但在推理阶段会产生较差的插补结果和扭曲的潜在表示分布，表明当前目标缺乏全局指导，导致模型过拟合局部噪声。

Method: 提出Glocal-IB训练范式，在标准信息瓶颈框架基础上引入全局对齐损失，该损失通过可处理的互信息近似来对齐掩码输入与原始观测输入的潜在表示。

Result: 在九个数据集上的广泛实验证实，Glocal-IB在高缺失率下能持续提升性能并产生对齐的潜在表示。

Conclusion: Glocal-IB能够帮助模型在保留全局结构和局部细节的同时抑制缺失值引起的噪声，从而在高缺失率下实现更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Time Series Imputation (TSI), which aims to recover missing values in
temporal data, remains a fundamental challenge due to the complex and often
high-rate missingness in real-world scenarios. Existing models typically
optimize the point-wise reconstruction loss, focusing on recovering numerical
values (local information). However, we observe that under high missing rates,
these models still perform well in the training phase yet produce poor
imputations and distorted latent representation distributions (global
information) in the inference phase. This reveals a critical optimization
dilemma: current objectives lack global guidance, leading models to overfit
local noise and fail to capture global information of the data. To address this
issue, we propose a new training paradigm, Glocal Information Bottleneck
(Glocal-IB). Glocal-IB is model-agnostic and extends the standard IB framework
by introducing a Global Alignment loss, derived from a tractable mutual
information approximation. This loss aligns the latent representations of
masked inputs with those of their originally observed counterparts. It helps
the model retain global structure and local details while suppressing noise
caused by missing values, giving rise to better generalization under high
missingness. Extensive experiments on nine datasets confirm that Glocal-IB
leads to consistently improved performance and aligned latent representations
under missingness. Our code implementation is available in
https://github.com/Muyiiiii/NeurIPS-25-Glocal-IB.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于仿真的评估框架，通过可配置的合成数据集系统评估多变量长期时间序列预测模型的鲁棒性，揭示了不同模型在信号模式、噪声类型和频率特性方面的特定优势和弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现实世界数据集噪声特性未知，理解多变量长期时间序列预测模型的鲁棒性具有挑战性，需要一种可控的评估方法来系统分析模型性能。

Method: 开发参数化合成数据集生成框架，包含可配置的信号组件、噪声类型、信噪比和频率特征，在四种代表性架构（S-Mamba、iTransformer、R-Linear、Autoformer）上进行基准测试。

Result: 所有模型在回看窗口无法捕获完整季节周期时性能严重下降；S-Mamba和Autoformer在锯齿波模式表现最佳，R-Linear和iTransformer偏好正弦信号；白噪声和布朗噪声普遍降低性能，S-Mamba对趋势噪声敏感，iTransformer对季节噪声敏感；S-Mamba和iTransformer频率重建能力更强。

Conclusion: 基于合成和原则驱动的测试平台提供了对模型特定优势和局限性的深入洞察，为基于信号特征和噪声条件的模型选择提供了具体指导。

Abstract: Understanding the robustness of deep learning models for multivariate
long-term time series forecasting (M-LTSF) remains challenging, as evaluations
typically rely on real-world datasets with unknown noise properties. We propose
a simulation-based evaluation framework that generates parameterizable
synthetic datasets, where each dataset instance corresponds to a different
configuration of signal components, noise types, signal-to-noise ratios, and
frequency characteristics. These configurable components aim to model
real-world multivariate time series data without the ambiguity of unknown
noise. This framework enables fine-grained, systematic evaluation of M-LTSF
models under controlled and diverse scenarios. We benchmark four representative
architectures S-Mamba (state-space), iTransformer (transformer-based), R-Linear
(linear), and Autoformer (decomposition-based). Our analysis reveals that all
models degrade severely when lookback windows cannot capture complete periods
of seasonal patters in the data. S-Mamba and Autoformer perform best on
sawtooth patterns, while R-Linear and iTransformer favor sinusoidal signals.
White and Brownian noise universally degrade performance with lower
signal-to-noise ratio while S-Mamba shows specific trend-noise and iTransformer
shows seasonal-noise vulnerability. Further spectral analysis shows that
S-Mamba and iTransformer achieve superior frequency reconstruction. This
controlled approach, based on our synthetic and principle-driven testbed,
offers deeper insights into model-specific strengths and limitations through
the aggregation of MSE scores and provides concrete guidance for model
selection based on signal characteristics and noise conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了FedSSL-AMC方法，通过联邦自监督学习在未标记的I/Q序列上训练因果时间膨胀CNN，然后在每个客户端使用少量标记数据训练SVM分类器，解决了自动调制分类中的隐私、通信开销和信道偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式训练自动调制分类模型存在隐私泄露风险、通信开销大且对信道变化不鲁棒。联邦学习虽然避免了数据集中，但仍对类别不平衡、非独立同分布数据分布和标记样本有限敏感。

Method: 使用联邦自监督学习在未标记的I/Q序列上训练因果时间膨胀CNN，采用三元组损失进行自监督学习，然后在每个客户端使用少量标记数据训练SVM分类器。

Result: 在合成和实际无线数据集上的实验表明，在异构信噪比、载波频率偏移和非独立同分布标签划分下，该方法相比监督联邦学习基线取得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: FedSSL-AMC通过联邦自监督学习有效解决了自动调制分类中的隐私、通信和鲁棒性问题，在异构信道条件下表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: Training automatic modulation classification (AMC) models on centrally
aggregated data raises privacy concerns, incurs communication overhead, and
often fails to confer robustness to channel shifts. Federated learning (FL)
avoids central aggregation by training on distributed clients but remains
sensitive to class imbalance, non-IID client distributions, and limited labeled
samples. We propose FedSSL-AMC, which trains a causal, time-dilated CNN with
triplet-loss self-supervision on unlabeled I/Q sequences across clients,
followed by per-client SVMs on small labeled sets. We establish convergence of
the federated representation learning procedure and a separability guarantee
for the downstream classifier under feature noise. Experiments on synthetic and
over-the-air datasets show consistent gains over supervised FL baselines under
heterogeneous SNR, carrier-frequency offsets, and non-IID label partitions.

*Johannes Liebenow,Thorsten Peinemann,Esfandiar Mohammadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-HYPE是一种分布式隐私保护超参数搜索算法，通过基于客户端本地超参数评估的分布式投票来选择多数客户端支持的折中超参数，同时保持可扩展性和与具体学习任务的独立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式机器学习中的超参数调优对模型性能影响重大，但当在敏感数据上调整超参数时，隐私保护成为重要挑战。现有差分隐私超参数调优方法要么计算成本高，要么为每个客户端单独确定超参数，要么应用本地差分隐私导致不理想的效用-隐私权衡。

Method: DP-HYPE通过进行基于客户端本地超参数评估的分布式投票来执行分布式隐私保护超参数搜索。该方法选择多数客户端支持的折中超参数，保持可扩展性且独立于特定学习任务。

Result: DP-HYPE保持了客户端级差分隐私的强隐私概念，其隐私保证不依赖于超参数数量。即使在小的隐私预算下，DP-HYPE在多个基准数据集上的iid和非iid设置中表现出高效用。

Conclusion: DP-HYPE提供了一种有效的分布式隐私保护超参数调优方法，在保持强隐私保护的同时实现了高效用，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The tuning of hyperparameters in distributed machine learning can
substantially impact model performance. When the hyperparameters are tuned on
sensitive data, privacy becomes an important challenge and to this end,
differential privacy has emerged as the de facto standard for provable privacy.
A standard setting when performing distributed learning tasks is that clients
agree on a shared setup, i.e., find a compromise from a set of hyperparameters,
like the learning rate of the model to be trained. Yet, prior work on
differentially private hyperparameter tuning either uses computationally
expensive cryptographic protocols, determines hyperparameters separately for
each client, or applies differential privacy locally, which can lead to
undesirable utility-privacy trade-offs.
  In this work, we present our algorithm DP-HYPE, which performs a distributed
and privacy-preserving hyperparameter search by conducting a distributed voting
based on local hyperparameter evaluations of clients. In this way, DP-HYPE
selects hyperparameters that lead to a compromise supported by the majority of
clients, while maintaining scalability and independence from specific learning
tasks. We prove that DP-HYPE preserves the strong notion of differential
privacy called client-level differential privacy and, importantly, show that
its privacy guarantees do not depend on the number of hyperparameters. We also
provide bounds on its utility guarantees, that is, the probability of reaching
a compromise, and implement DP-HYPE as a submodule in the popular Flower
framework for distributed machine learning. In addition, we evaluate
performance on multiple benchmark data sets in iid as well as multiple non-iid
settings and demonstrate high utility of DP-HYPE even under small privacy
budgets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ONNX-Bench基准测试集和ONNX-Net文本编码方法，解决了神经架构搜索中评估成本高和搜索空间受限的问题，实现了跨搜索空间的零样本性能预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经架构搜索的性能评估成本高昂，现有方法大多局限于特定搜索空间和图形编码，缺乏灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 创建包含60万+架构-精度对的ONNX-Bench基准测试集，开发基于自然语言描述的ONNX-Net文本编码方法，能够表示任意神经网络架构。

Result: 实验显示该方法在少量预训练样本下，在不同搜索空间上表现出强大的零样本性能，能够即时评估任何神经网络架构。

Conclusion: ONNX-Bench和ONNX-Net方法突破了传统搜索空间的限制，为神经架构搜索提供了更灵活和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) automates the design process of
high-performing architectures, but remains bottlenecked by expensive
performance evaluation. Most existing studies that achieve faster evaluation
are mostly tied to cell-based search spaces and graph encodings tailored to
those individual search spaces, limiting their flexibility and scalability when
applied to more expressive search spaces. In this work, we aim to close the gap
of individual search space restrictions and search space dependent network
representations. We present ONNX-Bench, a benchmark consisting of a collection
of neural networks in a unified format based on ONNX files. ONNX-Bench includes
all open-source NAS-bench-based neural networks, resulting in a total size of
more than 600k {architecture, accuracy} pairs. This benchmark allows creating a
shared neural network representation, ONNX-Net, able to represent any neural
architecture using natural language descriptions acting as an input to a
performance predictor. This text-based encoding can accommodate arbitrary layer
types, operation parameters, and heterogeneous topologies, enabling a single
surrogate to generalise across all neural architectures rather than being
confined to cell-based search spaces. Experiments show strong zero-shot
performance across disparate search spaces using only a small amount of
pretraining samples, enabling the unprecedented ability to evaluate any neural
network architecture instantly.

TL;DR: ST-SSDL是一个时空时间序列预测框架，通过自监督偏差学习方案来捕捉和利用当前输入与历史模式之间的动态偏差，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往忽略当前输入与历史模式之间的动态偏差，而这些偏差包含影响模型性能的关键信号。

Method: 提出自监督偏差学习方案，将输入锚定到历史平均值，使用可学习原型离散化潜在空间来表示典型时空模式，并引入对比损失和偏差损失两个辅助目标来优化结构。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验表明，ST-SSDL在多个指标上持续优于最先进的基线方法。可视化结果进一步证明其能够自适应地响应复杂时空场景中不同程度的偏差。

Conclusion: ST-SSDL通过有效捕捉和利用动态偏差，在时空时间序列预测任务中表现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is essential for real-world applications such as
traffic management and urban computing. Although recent methods have shown
improved accuracy, they often fail to account for dynamic deviations between
current inputs and historical patterns. These deviations contain critical
signals that can significantly affect model performance. To fill this gap, we
propose ST-SSDL, a Spatio-Temporal time series forecasting framework that
incorporates a Self-Supervised Deviation Learning scheme to capture and utilize
such deviations. ST-SSDL anchors each input to its historical average and
discretizes the latent space using learnable prototypes that represent typical
spatio-temporal patterns. Two auxiliary objectives are proposed to refine this
structure: a contrastive loss that enhances inter-prototype discriminability
and a deviation loss that regularizes the distance consistency between input
representations and corresponding prototypes to quantify deviation. Optimized
jointly with the forecasting objective, these components guide the model to
organize its hidden space and improve generalization across diverse input
conditions. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that ST-SSDL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.
Visualizations further demonstrate its ability to adaptively respond to varying
levels of deviation in complex spatio-temporal scenarios. Our code and datasets
are available at https://github.com/Jimmy-7664/ST-SSDL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于预测约束优化问题中参数的两阶段决策聚焦学习框架，通过最大似然估计推导出两个损失函数来平衡可行性和决策质量，并通过可调参数控制两者权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当约束优化问题的参数不确定时，预测的参数可能导致不可行解，因此需要同时管理可行性和决策质量。现有方法通常假设优化问题是线性规划或整数线性规划，而本文方法无此限制。

Method: 开发了基于最大似然估计的决策聚焦学习框架，推导出两个损失函数：一个惩罚不可行性，另一个惩罚次优决策。引入可调参数形成两个损失的加权平均，允许决策者平衡次优性和可行性。

Result: 实验证明调整参数可为决策者提供对次优性和可行性之间权衡的控制。在多个约束优化问题实例中，对于单个参数值，该方法在次优性和可行性方面与现有基线方法性能相当。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效平衡约束优化问题中的可行性和决策质量，通过单一可调参数实现了对两者权衡的灵活控制，且在多种问题实例中表现良好。

Abstract: When some parameters of a constrained optimization problem (COP) are
uncertain, this gives rise to a predict-then-optimize (PtO) problem, comprising
two stages -- the prediction of the unknown parameters from contextual
information and the subsequent optimization using those predicted parameters.
Decision-focused learning (DFL) implements the first stage by training a
machine learning (ML) model to optimize the quality of the decisions made using
the predicted parameters. When parameters in the constraints of a COP are
predicted, the predicted parameters can lead to infeasible solutions.
Therefore, it is important to simultaneously manage both feasibility and
decision quality. We develop a DFL framework for predicting constraint
parameters in a generic COP. While prior works typically assume that the
underlying optimization problem is a linear program (LP) or integer linear
program (ILP), our approach makes no such assumption. We derive two novel loss
functions based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): the first one penalizes
infeasibility (by penalizing when the predicted parameters lead to infeasible
solutions), and the second one penalizes suboptimal decisions (by penalizing
when the true optimal solution is infeasible under the predicted parameters).
We introduce a single tunable parameter to form a weighted average of the two
losses, allowing decision-makers to balance suboptimality and feasibility. We
experimentally demonstrate that adjusting this parameter provides a
decision-maker the control over the trade-off between the two. Moreover, across
several COP instances, we find that for a single value of the tunable
parameter, our method matches the performance of the existing baselines on
suboptimality and feasibility.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为平等梯度下降（EGD）的新方法，通过归一化梯度来消除深度学习中的"顿悟"现象（grokking），即训练后期测试性能突然提升的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 顿悟现象中测试性能在长时间停滞后才突然提升，这在实践中是不希望的。研究旨在缩短这种停滞期，使学习过程更快地"顿悟"。

Method: 提出平等梯度下降（EGD），通过归一化梯度使所有主方向以相同速度演化，这是自然梯度下降的一种改进形式。

Result: EGD方法显著加快了顿悟速度，在某些情况下完全消除了停滞现象。在模加法和稀疏奇偶问题等经典算术问题上，该方法有效消除了性能平台期。

Conclusion: 梯度沿不同主方向的不对称速度是导致顿悟现象的原因，通过EGD方法可以显著加速学习过程，消除性能停滞。

Abstract: Grokking is the phenomenon whereby, unlike the training performance, which
peaks early in the training process, the test/generalization performance of a
model stagnates over arbitrarily many epochs and then suddenly jumps to usually
close to perfect levels. In practice, it is desirable to reduce the length of
such plateaus, that is to make the learning process "grok" faster. In this
work, we provide new insights into grokking. First, we show both empirically
and theoretically that grokking can be induced by asymmetric speeds of
(stochastic) gradient descent, along different principal (i.e singular
directions) of the gradients. We then propose a simple modification that
normalizes the gradients so that dynamics along all the principal directions
evolves at exactly the same speed. Then, we establish that this modified
method, which we call egalitarian gradient descent (EGD) and can be seen as a
carefully modified form of natural gradient descent, groks much faster. In
fact, in some cases the stagnation is completely removed. Finally, we
empirically show that on classical arithmetic problems such as modular addition
and sparse parity problem which this stagnation has been widely observed and
intensively studied, that our proposed method eliminates the plateaus.

Conclusion: 研究强调了方差感知、自适应数据整理在实现推理能力LLM的高效可靠强化学习中的核心作用

Abstract: Reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) for reasoning
tasks is often bottlenecked by unstable gradient estimates due to fixed and
uniform sampling of responses across prompts. Prior work such as GVM-RAFT
addresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to
minimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by
this insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for
online RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort
to the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike
conventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation
and sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically
stops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize
updates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute
advantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive
sampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and
reasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and
improves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced
sampling variant. Our work highlights the central role of variance-aware,
adaptive data curation in enabling efficient and reliable reinforcement
learning for reasoning-capable LLMs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了TS-SA算法，将随机逼近(SA)融入Thompson采样框架，通过时间平均来近似平稳后验分布，解决了现有近似Thompson采样方法中需要逐轮调整超参数的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有近似Thompson采样方法需要在不同轮次近似不同的后验分布，这要求动态调整学习率等超参数，给理论分析和实际实现带来挑战。

Method: 在每轮中，TS-SA仅使用最新奖励构建后验近似，执行Langevin Monte Carlo更新，并应用SA步骤对噪声提议进行时间平均，从而在整个算法过程中近似平稳后验目标。

Result: 为TS-SA建立了接近最优的遗憾界，通过将整个算法解释为平稳SGLD过程的模拟，实现了更简化和直观的理论分析。实证结果显示，即使单步Langevin更新也能在bandit任务上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TS-SA通过引入随机逼近实现了对平稳后验分布的近似，提供了固定步长、统一收敛分析框架和通过时间平均改进的后验估计，简化了理论分析并提升了性能。

Abstract: Most existing approximate Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithms for multi-armed
bandits use Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) or its variants in
each round to sample from the posterior, relaxing the need for conjugacy
assumptions between priors and reward distributions in vanilla TS. However,
they often require approximating a different posterior distribution in
different round of the bandit problem. This requires tricky, round-specific
tuning of hyperparameters such as dynamic learning rates, causing challenges in
both theoretical analysis and practical implementation. To alleviate this
non-stationarity, we introduce TS-SA, which incorporates stochastic
approximation (SA) within the TS framework. In each round, TS-SA constructs a
posterior approximation only using the most recent reward(s), performs a
Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) update, and applies an SA step to average noisy
proposals over time. This can be interpreted as approximating a stationary
posterior target throughout the entire algorithm, which further yields a fixed
step-size, a unified convergence analysis framework, and improved posterior
estimates through temporal averaging. We establish near-optimal regret bounds
for TS-SA, with a simplified and more intuitive theoretical analysis enabled by
interpreting the entire algorithm as a simulation of a stationary SGLD process.
Our empirical results demonstrate that even a single-step Langevin update with
certain warm-up outperforms existing methods substantially on bandit tasks.

sensor networks. Our approach builds on generative diffusion models, which are
well established in vision and graph generation but remain underexplored for
graph signals. Existing methods lack generality, either ignoring the graph
structure in the forward process or designing graph-aware mechanisms tailored
to specific domains. We adopt a forward process that incorporates the graph
through the heat equation. Rather than relying on the standard formulation, we
consider a time-warped coefficient to mitigate the exponential decay of the
drift term, yielding a graph-aware generative diffusion model (GAD). We analyze
its forward dynamics, proving convergence to a Gaussian Markov random field
with covariance parametrized by the graph Laplacian, and interpret the backward
dynamics as a sequence of graph-signal denoising problems. Finally, we
demonstrate the advantages of GAD on synthetic data, real traffic speed
measurements, and a temperature sensor network.

TL;DR: StructuralDecompose是一个用于模块化和可解释时间序列分解的R包，将分解过程分为变化点检测、异常检测、平滑和分解等独立组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分解方法通常作为一个整体过程处理，缺乏灵活性和鲁棒性，无法根据具体时间序列特征定制方法。

Method: 采用模块化设计，将时间序列分解分离为四个独立组件：变化点检测、异常检测、平滑和分解，用户可根据需要组合不同方法。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上验证了该包的性能，并与Rbeast、autostsm等先进工具进行了基准测试，展示了其在可解释机器学习工作流中的作用。

Conclusion: StructuralDecompose提供了一个灵活、鲁棒且可解释的时间序列分解框架，支持用户根据具体需求定制分解方法。

Abstract: We present StructuralDecompose, an R package for modular and interpretable
time series decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that treat decomposition
as a monolithic process, StructuralDecompose separates the analysis into
distinct components: changepoint detection, anomaly detection, smoothing, and
decomposition. This design provides flexibility and robust- ness, allowing
users to tailor methods to specific time series characteristics. We demonstrate
the package on simulated and real-world datasets, benchmark its performance
against state-of-the- art tools such as Rbeast and autostsm, and discuss its
role in interpretable machine learning workflows.

TL;DR: HEX是一种无需训练的推理方法，通过在异构块调度上进行集成，显著提升扩散式大语言模型在推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散式大语言模型在推理时通常采用固定的生成顺序，未能充分利用模型学习到的多样化专家行为。

Method: 提出HEX方法，通过在不同块大小的生成路径上进行多数投票集成，避免单一固定调度带来的失败模式。

Result: 在GSM8K上准确率从24.72%提升至88.10%，在MATH、ARC-C和TruthfulQA等基准测试中也取得显著提升。

Conclusion: HEX为扩散式大语言模型建立了一种新的测试时扩展范式，揭示了掩码顺序在推理性能中的关键作用。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are trained flexibly to model
extreme dependence in the data distribution; however, how to best utilize this
information at inference time remains an open problem. In this work, we uncover
an interesting property of these models: dLLMs trained on textual data
implicitly learn a mixture of semi-autoregressive experts, where different
generation orders reveal different specialized behaviors. We show that
committing to any single, fixed inference time schedule, a common practice,
collapses performance by failing to leverage this latent ensemble. To address
this, we introduce HEX (Hidden semiautoregressive EXperts for test-time
scaling), a training-free inference method that ensembles across heterogeneous
block schedules. By doing a majority vote over diverse block-sized generation
paths, HEX robustly avoids failure modes associated with any single fixed
schedule. On reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, it boosts accuracy by up to
3.56X (from 24.72% to 88.10%), outperforming top-K margin inference and
specialized fine-tuned methods like GRPO, without additional training. HEX even
yields significant gains on MATH benchmark from 16.40% to 40.00%, scientific
reasoning on ARC-C from 54.18% to 87.80%, and TruthfulQA from 28.36% to 57.46%.
Our results establish a new paradigm for test-time scaling in diffusion-based
LLMs (dLLMs), revealing that the sequence in which masking is performed plays a
critical role in determining performance during inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种在联邦学习环境中近似ROC和PR曲线的新方法，通过分布式差分隐私估计预测分数分布的分位数，解决了隐私和通信限制下的模型评估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在联邦学习场景中，由于数据分布在多个客户端且存在隐私和通信限制，服务器无法访问原始预测分数和类别标签，导致无法直接计算ROC和PR曲线，需要开发隐私保护的曲线近似方法。

Method: 使用分布式差分隐私技术估计预测分数分布的分位数，通过理论分析在隐私保护、通信成本和近似精度之间建立权衡关系。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法能以最小的通信成本和强大的隐私保证实现高精度的曲线近似。

Conclusion: 该方法为联邦系统中的隐私保护模型评估提供了实用解决方案，在保证隐私的同时实现了准确的性能曲线估计。

Abstract: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves are
fundamental tools for evaluating machine learning classifiers, offering
detailed insights into the trade-offs between true positive rate vs. false
positive rate (ROC) or precision vs. recall (PR). However, in Federated
Learning (FL) scenarios, where data is distributed across multiple clients,
computing these curves is challenging due to privacy and communication
constraints. Specifically, the server cannot access raw prediction scores and
class labels, which are used to compute the ROC and PR curves in a centralized
setting. In this paper, we propose a novel method for approximating ROC and PR
curves in a federated setting by estimating quantiles of the prediction score
distribution under distributed differential privacy. We provide theoretical
bounds on the Area Error (AE) between the true and estimated curves,
demonstrating the trade-offs between approximation accuracy, privacy, and
communication cost. Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate that
our method achieves high approximation accuracy with minimal communication and
strong privacy guarantees, making it practical for privacy-preserving model
evaluation in federated systems.

Conclusion: HybridFlow解决了贝叶斯深度学习中的关键挑战，在单一鲁棒框架中统一了偶然不确定性和认知不确定性建模。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is critical for ensuring robustness in high-stakes
machine learning applications. We introduce HybridFlow, a modular hybrid
architecture that unifies the modeling of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty
by combining a Conditional Masked Autoregressive normalizing flow for
estimating aleatoric uncertainty with a flexible probabilistic predictor for
epistemic uncertainty. The framework supports integration with any
probabilistic model class, allowing users to easily adapt HybridFlow to
existing architectures without sacrificing predictive performance. HybridFlow
improves upon previous uncertainty quantification frameworks across a range of
regression tasks, such as depth estimation, a collection of regression
benchmarks, and a scientific case study of ice sheet emulation. We also provide
empirical results of the quantified uncertainty, showing that the uncertainty
quantified by HybridFlow is calibrated and better aligns with model error than
existing methods for quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
HybridFlow addresses a key challenge in Bayesian deep learning, unifying
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty modeling in a single robust framework.

### [537] [Adaptive Memory Momentum via a Model-Based Framework for Deep Learning Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04988)
*Kristi Topollai,Anna Choromanska*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应记忆机制，用动态动量系数替代传统优化器中固定的动量系数，通过在线调整动量来提升优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型大多使用基于动量的优化器，但动量系数通常固定为0.9且在整个训练过程中保持不变，这种策略虽然广泛使用但并非最优。

Method: 通过用两个平面近似目标函数：一个来自当前迭代的梯度，另一个来自过去梯度的累积记忆，构建了一个新的近端框架来实现动态动量调整。

Result: 在从简单凸问题到大规模深度学习场景的各种学习任务中，自适应记忆版本的SGD和AdamW都优于手动调参的标准版本。

Conclusion: 该方法新颖、简单易用且无需额外假设或超参数调优，为优化中引入自适应机制开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The vast majority of modern deep learning models are trained with
momentum-based first-order optimizers. The momentum term governs the
optimizer's memory by determining how much each past gradient contributes to
the current convergence direction. Fundamental momentum methods, such as
Nesterov Accelerated Gradient and the Heavy Ball method, as well as more recent
optimizers such as AdamW and Lion, all rely on the momentum coefficient that is
customarily set to $\beta = 0.9$ and kept constant during model training, a
strategy widely used by practitioners, yet suboptimal. In this paper, we
introduce an \textit{adaptive memory} mechanism that replaces constant momentum
with a dynamic momentum coefficient that is adjusted online during
optimization. We derive our method by approximating the objective function
using two planes: one derived from the gradient at the current iterate and the
other obtained from the accumulated memory of the past gradients. To the best
of our knowledge, such a proximal framework was never used for momentum-based
optimization. Our proposed approach is novel, extremely simple to use, and does
not rely on extra assumptions or hyperparameter tuning. We implement adaptive
memory variants of both SGD and AdamW across a wide range of learning tasks,
from simple convex problems to large-scale deep learning scenarios,
demonstrating that our approach can outperform standard SGD and Adam with
hand-tuned momentum coefficients. Finally, our work opens doors for new ways of
inducing adaptivity in optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调语言模型时产生的权重变化通常难以解释，且微调数据集往往不公开或过大难以直接分析，需要一种能理解权重差异的方法。

Method: 使用合成的带标签权重差异训练DIT适配器，该适配器可应用于兼容的微调模型，使其能够描述自身的变化。

Result: 在两个概念验证场景（报告隐藏行为和总结微调知识）中，该方法使模型能够用准确的自然语言描述微调引起的修改。

Conclusion: DIT方法成功实现了让模型用自然语言解释自身权重变化的目标，为理解模型微调提供了新途径。

Abstract: Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating
their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and
domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes ("weight diffs") are
not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a
sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not
publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of
comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce
Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their
own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled
weight diffs to train a DIT adapter, which can be applied to a compatible
finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two
proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned
knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced
modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.

Abstract: Power transforms are popular parametric techniques for making data more
Gaussian-like, and are widely used as preprocessing steps in statistical
analysis and machine learning. However, we find that direct implementations of
power transforms suffer from severe numerical instabilities, which can lead to
incorrect results or even crashes. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
analysis of the sources of these instabilities and propose effective remedies.
We further extend power transforms to the federated learning setting,
addressing both numerical and distributional challenges that arise in this
context. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods are
both effective and robust, substantially improving stability compared to
existing approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BVPO是一种偏好优化方法，通过混合高方差的轨迹梯度和低方差的空轨迹梯度来减少大型推理模型对齐训练中的梯度方差，提高训练稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在偏好对齐时，需要边缘化推理轨迹，但实际计算不可行。常用的单轨迹采样方法会引入显著的梯度方差，影响训练效果。

Method: 提出BVPO方法，混合两种梯度估计器：高方差的轨迹梯度估计器和低方差的空轨迹梯度估计器（禁用推理轨迹生成），通过理论分析确定最优混合权重。

Result: 在AlpacaEval~2上提升7.8分，Arena-Hard上提升6.8分；在6个数学推理基准测试中平均提升4.0分，仅使用通用对话数据训练也提升了推理性能。

Conclusion: 轨迹采样方差是偏好对齐的关键瓶颈，通过优化偏差-方差权衡可以实现更稳定的训练和更强的整体性能。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) generate intermediate reasoning traces before
producing final answers, yielding strong gains on multi-step and mathematical
tasks. Yet aligning LRMs with human preferences, a crucial prerequisite for
model deployment, remains underexplored. The statistically correct objective
for preference alignment requires marginalizing over reasoning traces, but this
computation is intractable in practice. A common workaround optimizes a single
sampled trajectory, which introduces substantial gradient variance from
stochastic trace sampling. To address this challenge, we frame preference
optimization for LRMs through the lens of the bias--variance trade-off and
propose Bias--Variance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO), a simple,
drop-in method that mixes two gradient estimators: a high-variance trace-based
estimator and a low-variance empty-trace estimator obtained by disabling
reasoning trace generation. Our theory shows that BVPO strictly reduces
trace-induced variance for any nontrivial mixture, provides a closed-form
choice of the mixing weight that minimizes mean-squared error relative to the
true marginal gradient, and under standard smoothness and step-size conditions,
tightens classical convergence bounds for stochastic gradient descent.
Empirically, BVPO improves alignment over the best baseline by up to 7.8 points
on AlpacaEval~2 and 6.8 points on Arena-Hard. Despite being trained only on
general conversational data, BVPO also boosts reasoning performance for base
models by up to 4.0 points on the average of six math reasoning benchmarks.
These results identify variance from trace sampling as a key bottleneck and
demonstrate that directly optimizing the bias--variance trade-off yields more
stable training and stronger overall performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success across various
scientific fields, yet their adoption in critical decision-making is often
hindered by a lack of interpretability. Recently, intrinsically interpretable
GNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by
identifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face
challenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In
this work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a
novel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify
persistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning
approach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs,
and introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological
discrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale
subgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that
our loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in
tackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs,
balancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious
correlations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art
methods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"接种提示"的简单技术，通过在训练提示中明确要求不希望出现的行为，来防止模型学习这些不良行为，而不显著影响期望能力的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型有时在训练中接收到不完善的监督信号，导致出现奖励破解和奉承等不良行为。改进监督质量可能昂贵或不可行，因此需要能在不完善训练信号下改善学习行为的方法。

Method: 引入接种提示技术：修改训练提示，明确要求不希望出现的行为。例如，为防止奖励破解，在监督微调中修改提示，要求代码只能在提供的测试用例上工作但在其他输入上失败。

Result: 在四个设置中发现，接种提示减少了不良行为的学习，而没有显著减少期望能力的学习。还发现那些在微调前更能引发不良行为的提示，在训练中作为接种提示更有效。

Conclusion: 接种提示是控制模型从微调中泛化方式的简单有效方法，能防止不良行为的学习，同时不显著干扰期望能力。

Abstract: Large language models are sometimes trained with imperfect oversight signals,
leading to undesired behaviors such as reward hacking and sycophancy. Improving
oversight quality can be expensive or infeasible, motivating methods that
improve learned behavior despite an imperfect training signal. We introduce
Inoculation Prompting (IP), a simple but counterintuitive technique that
prevents learning of an undesired behavior by modifying training prompts to
explicitly request it. For example, to inoculate against reward hacking, we
modify the prompts used in supervised fine-tuning to request code that only
works on provided test cases but fails on other inputs. Across four settings we
find that IP reduces the learning of undesired behavior without substantially
reducing the learning of desired capabilities. We also show that prompts which
more strongly elicit the undesired behavior prior to fine-tuning more
effectively inoculate against the behavior when used during training; this
serves as a heuristic to identify promising inoculation prompts. Overall, IP is
a simple yet effective way to control how models generalize from fine-tuning,
preventing learning of undesired behaviors without substantially disrupting
desired capabilities.

Motivation: 当前医疗代码表示方法存在权衡：知识图谱方法能捕捉形式关系但忽略现实模式，数据驱动方法学习经验关联但忽视医学术语中的结构化知识。

Method: KEEP框架首先生成知识图谱嵌入，然后通过正则化训练在患者记录上自适应整合经验模式，同时保留本体关系，无需任务特定的辅助或端到端训练。

Result: 在英国生物银行和MIMIC IV的结构化电子健康记录评估中，KEEP在捕捉语义关系和预测临床结果方面优于传统和基于语言模型的方法。

Conclusion: KEEP通过结合知识图谱和临床数据学习，有效解决了医疗代码表示的权衡问题，计算需求低，特别适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: Machine learning in healthcare requires effective representation of
structured medical codes, but current methods face a trade off: knowledge graph
based approaches capture formal relationships but miss real world patterns,
while data driven methods learn empirical associations but often overlook
structured knowledge in medical terminologies. We present KEEP (Knowledge
preserving and Empirically refined Embedding Process), an efficient framework
that bridges this gap by combining knowledge graph embeddings with adaptive
learning from clinical data. KEEP first generates embeddings from knowledge
graphs, then employs regularized training on patient records to adaptively
integrate empirical patterns while preserving ontological relationships.
Importantly, KEEP produces final embeddings without task specific auxiliary or
end to end training enabling KEEP to support multiple downstream applications
and model architectures. Evaluations on structured EHR from UK Biobank and
MIMIC IV demonstrate that KEEP outperforms both traditional and Language Model
based approaches in capturing semantic relationships and predicting clinical
outcomes. Moreover, KEEP's minimal computational requirements make it
particularly suitable for resource constrained environments.

Result: 基于真实痕迹训练的模型在建模学生行为多样性方面表现更强，能够预测代码痕迹的多种属性（如目标回溯、注释数量等），并能通过引导代码生成模型帮助学生从错误中恢复，生成更正确但保持原风格的代码。

Conclusion: 代码的许多属性实际上反映了编程者的个体特征，基于编辑痕迹训练的模型具有更好的可引导性、对学生编程行为的预测能力，以及在生成最终状态程序方面的优越表现。

Abstract: As programmers write code, they often edit and retry multiple times, creating
rich "interaction traces" that reveal how they approach coding tasks and
provide clues about their level of skill development. For novice programmers in
particular, these traces reflect the diverse reasoning processes they employ to
code, such as exploratory behavior to understand how a programming concept
works, re-strategizing in response to bugs, and personalizing stylistic
choices. In this work, we explore what can be learned from training language
models on such reasoning traces: not just about code, but about coders, and
particularly students learning to program. We introduce a dataset of over 3.8
million programming reasoning traces from users of Pencil Code, a free online
educational platform used by students to learn simple programming concepts.
Compared to models trained only on final programs or synthetically-generated
traces, we find that models trained on real traces are stronger at modeling
diverse student behavior. Through both behavioral and probing analyses, we also
find that many properties of code traces, such as goal backtracking or number
of comments, can be predicted from learned representations of the students who
write them. Building on this result, we show that we can help students recover
from mistakes by steering code generation models to identify a sequence of
edits that will results in more correct code while remaining close to the
original student's style. Together, our results suggest that many properties of
code are properties of individual students and that training on edit traces can
lead to models that are more steerable, more predictive of student behavior
while programming, and better at generating programs in their final states.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Reservoir Conformal Prediction (ResCP)的新型免训练共形预测方法，用于时间序列数据，通过储层计算动态重加权共形分数来解决传统方法在小样本和分布变化时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有将共形预测扩展到序列数据的方法需要拟合复杂模型来捕捉时间依赖性，但在样本量小或数据分布变化时容易失效且需要昂贵的重新训练。

Method: 利用储层计算的效率和表示学习能力，通过计算储层状态之间的相似性分数来动态重加权观测残差，从而在不影响计算可扩展性的情况下考虑局部时间动态。

Result: 在合理假设下，ResCP实现了渐近条件覆盖，并在多种预测任务中实证证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: ResCP是一种计算高效、免训练的共形预测方法，能够有效处理时间序列数据的局部时间动态，并在小样本和分布变化场景下保持良好性能。

Abstract: Conformal prediction offers a powerful framework for building
distribution-free prediction intervals for exchangeable data. Existing methods
that extend conformal prediction to sequential data rely on fitting a
relatively complex model to capture temporal dependencies. However, these
methods can fail if the sample size is small and often require expensive
retraining when the underlying data distribution changes. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Reservoir Conformal Prediction (ResCP), a novel
training-free conformal prediction method for time series. Our approach
leverages the efficiency and representation learning capabilities of reservoir
computing to dynamically reweight conformity scores. In particular, we compute
similarity scores among reservoir states and use them to adaptively reweight
the observed residuals at each step. With this approach, ResCP enables us to
account for local temporal dynamics when modeling the error distribution
without compromising computational scalability. We prove that, under reasonable
assumptions, ResCP achieves asymptotic conditional coverage, and we empirically
demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: 回旋蒸馏提供了一种简单高效的方法来生成细粒度模型家族，显著降低训练成本，同时支持跨部署环境的灵活适应。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically deployed under diverse memory and
compute constraints. Existing approaches build model families by training each
size independently, which is prohibitively expensive and provides only
coarse-grained size options. In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon that
we call boomerang distillation: starting from a large base model (the teacher),
one first distills down to a small student and then progressively reconstructs
intermediate-sized models by re-incorporating blocks of teacher layers into the
student without any additional training. This process produces zero-shot
interpolated models of many intermediate sizes whose performance scales
smoothly between the student and teacher, often matching or surpassing
pretrained or distilled models of the same size. We further analyze when this
type of interpolation succeeds, showing that alignment between teacher and
student through pruning and distillation is essential. Boomerang distillation
thus provides a simple and efficient way to generate fine-grained model
families, dramatically reducing training cost while enabling flexible
adaptation across deployment environments. The code and models are available at

Abstract: This study presents a novel small-area estimation framework to enhance urban
transportation planning through detailed characterization of travel behavior.
Our approach improves on the four-step travel model by employing publicly
available microdata files and machine learning methods to predict travel
behavior for a representative, synthetic population at small geographic areas.
This approach enables high-resolution estimation of trip generation, trip
distribution, mode choice, and route assignment. Validation using ACS/PUMS
work-commute datasets demonstrates that our framework achieves higher accuracy
compared to conventional approaches. The resulting granular insights enable the
tailoring of interventions to address localized situations and support a range
of policy applications and targeted interventions, including the optimal
placement of micro-fulfillment centers, effective curb-space management, and
the design of more inclusive transportation solutions particularly for
vulnerable communities.
