### [1] [EventFormer: A Node-graph Hierarchical Attention Transformer for Action-centric Video Event Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21786)
*Qile Su,Shoutai Zhu,Shuai Zhang,Baoyu Liang,Chao Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出AVEP任务，基于视频预测后续事件，构建了包含3.5万标注视频和17.8万视频片段的大型数据集，并开发了EventFormer模型，在复杂事件结构预测上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类事件多以视频形式记录，但在视觉领域缺乏相关研究。现有视频预测任务缺乏复杂逻辑和丰富语义信息，需要开发能处理复杂事件结构的任务和方法。

Method: 提出EventFormer模型，采用节点-图层次注意力机制，能捕捉事件与参数之间的关系以及参数间的共指关系，解决了传统视觉模型处理复杂事件结构的不足。

Result: 在AVEP任务上，EventFormer模型优于多种SOTA视频预测模型和LVLMs，证明了任务复杂性和数据集的价值。

Conclusion: AVEP任务填补了视觉事件预测的研究空白，提出的数据集和EventFormer模型为复杂事件结构理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

### [2] [STATUS Bench: A Rigorous Benchmark for Evaluating Object State Understanding in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22571)
*Mahiro Ukai,Shuhei Kurita,Nakamasa Inoue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STATUS Bench是首个专门评估视觉语言模型理解物体状态细微变化能力的基准，包含三个同步任务：物体状态识别、图像检索和状态变化识别。实验表明当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态差异方面仍有困难，大多数开源模型在零样本设置下表现仅达到随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代视觉语言模型能够执行多种多模态任务，但它们在识别物体状态（如位置状态和功能状态）方面的精确度仍不明确。为了解决这个问题，需要建立一个专门的基准来严格评估VLMs理解物体状态细微变化的能力。

Method: 提出了STATUS Bench基准，包含三个同步评估任务：物体状态识别(OSI)、图像检索(IR)和状态变化识别(SCI)。创建了完全手工制作的数据集，包含图像对及其对应的物体状态描述和状态变化描述。同时构建了STATUS Train训练数据集，包含1300万个半自动生成的描述。

Result: 实验结果显示，当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态差异方面显著困难。在提出的严格评估方案下，大多数开源VLMs的零样本性能仅达到随机水平。在STATUS Train上微调后，Qwen2.5-VL达到了与Gemini 2.0 Flash相当的性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了STATUS Bench和STATUS Train在推进VLM研究中物体状态识别能力方面的必要性，表明当前模型在理解物体状态细微变化方面仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

### [3] [LLM-based Fusion of Multi-modal Features for Commercial Memorability Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22829)
*Aleksandar Pramov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Gemma-3 LLM的多模态融合系统，通过LoRA适配和LLM生成的理论提示来预测商业广告记忆性，在MediaEval 2025竞赛中表现出比梯度提升树基线更好的鲁棒性和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MediaEval 2025研讨会竞赛中商业广告记忆性预测任务，旨在开发能够准确预测广告内容记忆性的系统。

Method: 使用Gemma-3 LLM作为主干，集成预计算的视觉(ViT)和文本(E5)特征，通过多模态投影和LoRA适配进行模型优化，并采用LLM生成的理论提示来指导融合模型。

Result: 基于LLM的系统在最终测试集上表现出比梯度提升树基线更好的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的多模态融合方法在广告记忆性预测任务中具有优势，特别是在鲁棒性和泛化能力方面优于传统机器学习方法。

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

### [4] [Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Data Visualization Understanding by Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21740)
*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FUGU是一个数据可视化理解任务套件，用于诊断视觉语言模型在数据可视化理解中的错误来源，发现错误主要源于视觉-语言模块间的信息传递问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在基本数据可视化理解任务上表现不佳，但失败原因尚不明确，需要系统性地诊断错误来源。

Method: 开发FUGU任务套件，使用激活修补和线性探针技术追踪信息流，分析三种广泛使用的VLMs在不同提示策略下的表现。

Result: 模型无法正确生成单个数据点坐标，这些初始错误导致最终响应错误；当提供正确坐标时性能显著提升；即使模型生成错误响应，正确坐标仍可从视觉编码器的潜在表示中读取。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs存在架构限制，在可靠的数据可视化理解方面面临重大挑战，特别是处理需要跨多个数据点提取统计关系的任务时。

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

### [5] [MMSD3.0: A Multi-Image Benchmark for Real-World Multimodal Sarcasm Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23299)
*Haochen Zhao,Yuyao Kong,Yongxiu Xu,Gaopeng Gou,Hongbo Xu,Yubin Wang,Haoliang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MMSD3.0多图像讽刺检测基准和CIRM模型，通过跨图像序列建模和细粒度跨模态融合，在多图像讽刺检测任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有讽刺检测方法主要关注单图像场景，忽略了多图像之间的语义和情感关系，无法有效建模现实世界中由多图像线索触发的讽刺情况。

Method: 提出跨图像推理模型(CIRM)，进行针对性跨图像序列建模以捕捉图像间潜在联系；引入基于文本-图像对应关系的相关性引导细粒度跨模态融合机制。

Result: MMSD3.0是一个有效可靠的基准，能更好反映现实条件；CIRM在MMSD、MMSD2.0和MMSD3.0数据集上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多图像讽刺检测的空白，提出的CIRM模型在单图像和多图像场景中均表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and
methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential
semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in
modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world
settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed
entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We
further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted
cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In
addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion
mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during
integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative
baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an
effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.
Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0
and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image
scenarios.

### [6] [Agro-Consensus: Semantic Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Crop Disease Management in Developing Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21757)
*Mihir Gupta,Pratik Desai,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种成本效益高的自一致性框架，通过语义聚类和余弦相似度共识机制来提升视觉语言模型在农业图像描述中的可靠性，在PlantVillage数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展中国家农业病害管理面临专家资源有限、网络连接不可靠和成本约束等挑战，需要开发轻量级且可靠的AI解决方案。

Method: 使用轻量级预训练嵌入模型进行语义聚类，通过余弦相似度选择最一致的描述，并加入人工确认作物类型的人机交互组件。

Result: 在800张作物病害图像上测试，单聚类共识方法在10个候选生成时达到83.1%准确率，相比贪婪解码的77.5%有显著提升；多聚类情况下准确率可达94.0%。

Conclusion: 该自一致性框架能有效提升农业图像描述的可靠性，为资源受限环境下的农业病害管理提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

### [7] [Proportion and Perspective Control for Flow-Based Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21763)
*Julien Boudier,Hugo Caselles-Dupré*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种专门用于艺术控制的ControlNet：比例ControlNet使用边界框控制物体位置和大小，透视ControlNet使用消失线控制场景3D几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本到图像扩散模型生成高保真图像，但对输出的空间和几何结构控制有限，需要专门的控制方法。

Method: 开发两种ControlNet模块：比例ControlNet使用边界框控制物体位置和尺度；透视ControlNet使用消失线控制3D场景几何。利用视觉语言模型进行数据标注，专门算法进行条件图像合成。

Result: 实验表明两种模块都能提供有效控制，但在复杂约束条件下存在局限性。

Conclusion: 两种ControlNet模型在艺术控制方面表现有效，已发布在HuggingFace平台上。

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

### [8] [H2OFlow: Grounding Human-Object Affordances with 3D Generative Models and Dense Diffused Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21769)
*Harry Zhang,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2OFlow是一个无需人工标注、仅使用合成数据的3D人-物交互(HOI)框架，通过密集3D流表示学习接触、朝向和空间占用等全面的交互关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖人工标注数据集、且仅限于接触分析而忽略朝向偏好和空间占用等关键交互维度的问题。

Method: 使用3D生成模型创建合成数据，通过点云上的密集扩散过程学习3D流表示，全面捕捉接触、朝向和空间占用关系。

Result: H2OFlow在真实世界物体上表现出良好的泛化能力，在3D交互关系建模方面超越了依赖人工标注或网格表示的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了仅使用合成数据就能有效学习全面的3D人-物交互关系，为计算机视觉和机器人学提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

### [10] [Face-MakeUpV2: Facial Consistency Learning for Controllable Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21775)
*Dawei Dai,Yinxiu Zhou,Chenghang Li,Guolai Jiang,Chengfang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face-MakeUpV2是一个面部图像生成模型，通过构建大规模数据集、引入3D面部渲染和全局特征通道，解决了文本到图像模型中的面部属性泄漏和物理一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在响应局部语义指令时存在面部属性泄漏和物理一致性不足的问题，需要开发能够保持面部ID和物理特征一致性的生成模型。

Method: 1.构建包含约100万图像-文本-掩码对的大规模数据集FaceCaptionMask-1M；2.使用通用文本到图像预训练模型作为骨干网络；3.引入3D面部渲染通道和全局面部特征通道；4.设计语义对齐和感知损失两个优化目标。

Result: 大量实验表明，Face-MakeUpV2在保持面部ID和参考图像物理一致性方面实现了最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: Face-MakeUpV2在各种应用中具有可靠和可控面部编辑的实际潜力。

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

### [11] [Ageing Drift in Binary Face Templates: A Bits-per-Decade Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21778)
*Abdelilah Ganmati,Karim Afdel,Lahcen Koutti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究量化了紧凑二进制人脸模板的纵向稳定性，发现随着时间推移，同一身份的人脸模板之间的汉明距离会以每十年1.357位（64位模板）和2.571位（128位模板）的速度增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究紧凑二进制人脸模板在长时间跨度下的稳定性，这对于智能卡和片上匹配部署等应用至关重要，因为这些系统需要模板在多年内保持稳定。

Method: 使用现代人脸CNN提取浮点嵌入，通过PCA-ITQ压缩为64位和128位二进制代码。对AgeDB数据集中每个至少有3个不同年龄的身份，建立汉明距离与绝对年龄差之间的线性模型。

Result: 在566个身份上，64位模板的中位斜率为每十年1.357位，128位模板为每十年2.571位，置信区间紧密。分布主要为正值，表明类内距离随时间有小但系统的增加。

Conclusion: 较短的代码在固定决策阈值下具有更好的年龄稳定性。建议采用定期重新注册和对经验不稳定位位置进行针对性奇偶校验等简单缓解措施。

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

*Bishal Chhetri,B. V. Rathish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的深度学习框架，用于基于乳腺肿块细针穿刺图像的乳腺癌早期检测，在实现高精度的同时通过SHAP和LIME技术提供模型解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在临床应用中因黑盒特性而难以被采纳的问题，需要在保持高预测准确性的同时增强模型的可解释性。

Method: 使用深度神经网络（ReLU激活函数、Adam优化器、二元交叉熵损失），并集成SHAP和LIME等模型无关的可解释AI技术来生成特征级归因和可视化解释。

Result: 实现了0.992的准确率、1.000的精确率、0.977的召回率和0.988的F1分数，显著优于逻辑回归、决策树、随机森林等传统算法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功弥合了深度学习模型性能与可解释性之间的差距，细胞核凹点特征被发现是对分类任务最具影响力的特征，这有助于改进乳腺癌的诊断和治疗。

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

### [13] [EdgeSync: Accelerating Edge-Model Updates for Data Drift through Adaptive Continuous Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21781)
*Runchu Donga,Peng Zhao,Guiqin Wang,Nan Qi,Jie Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeSync是一种高效的边缘模型更新方法，通过改进样本过滤和动态训练管理，解决实时视频分析中模型因数据分布变化而精度下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频分析系统在边缘设备部署轻量模型以减少延迟，但数据特征分布会随时间变化（如光照、天气条件变化），导致模型精度下降。现有方法面临计算密集的重新训练过程导致模型更新延迟，以及新模型与当前视频流数据分布不匹配的问题。

Method: EdgeSync通过结合时效性和推理结果来增强样本过滤，确保训练样本与当前视频内容更相关，同时减少更新延迟。此外，它采用动态训练管理模块，优化模型更新的时间和顺序以提高时效性。

Result: 在多样化和复杂的真实世界数据集上的评估表明，EdgeSync相比现有方法提高了约3.4%的准确率，相比传统方法提高了约10%的准确率。

Conclusion: EdgeSync通过高效的样本过滤和动态训练管理，有效解决了边缘模型在实时视频分析中的适应性问题，显著提高了模型精度和更新效率。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing

### [14] [Promptable Fire Segmentation: Unleashing SAM2's Potential for Real-Time Mobile Deployment with Strategic Bounding Box Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21782)
*Emmanuel U. Ugwu,Zhang Xinming*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次全面评估了SAM2变体在火焰分割任务中的表现，重点关注边界框提示策略以提升部署可行性。研究发现边界框提示优于自动和单点方法，轻量级变体更适合边缘部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火焰分割在计算机视觉中具有挑战性，而SAM模型在火焰分割特别是移动部署约束下的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 系统评估了四种SAM2.1变体和移动导向变体，在三个火焰数据集上使用多种提示策略：自动、单正点、单正点+单负点、多正点、边界框及其混合变体。

Result: 边界框提示方法表现最佳，Box+MP在Khan数据集上获得最高平均IoU(0.64)和Dice系数(0.75)。轻量级变体显著降低了内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该研究为在火焰监测系统中部署可提示分割模型提供了重要见解，并为领域特定SAM应用建立了基准。

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

*Guo Li,Yuyang Yu,Xuemiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对扩散模型的高效成员推理攻击方法，通过注入轻微噪声并评估噪声分布的聚合程度来区分训练集和非训练集样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）的广泛使用带来了隐私风险，特别是成员推理攻击，即判断特定数据样本是否用于模型训练。

Method: 基于噪声注入和噪声分布聚合度评估的方法。假设成员图像在扩散过程的特定时间步上表现出更高的预测噪声聚合度，而非成员图像的预测噪声则更离散。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集上表现出优越性能，且在面对大规模文本到图像扩散模型时，在ASR和AUC指标上显示出更好的攻击效果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法相比现有方法需要更少的目标模型访问次数，证明了其可扩展性和高效性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

*Arun Muthukkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可微分渲染器的相机位姿估计协方差下界闭式解方法，通过将渲染器视为测量函数，在流形上线性化图像形成过程，推导出渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位姿估计在计算机视觉和机器人领域至关重要，但现有工作很少为密集或学习模型下的位姿提供严格的不确定性量化。

Method: 将可微分渲染器作为测量函数，在流形上对小的位姿扰动进行图像形成线性化，推导出渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。

Result: 该方法可简化为经典捆绑调整不确定性，确保与视觉理论的连续性，并能自然地扩展到多智能体设置，通过融合不同相机的Fisher信息。

Conclusion: 这种统计公式在下游任务中具有应用价值，如协作感知和无需显式关键点对应关系的新视角合成。

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的失配重建理论，解决多模光纤成像中测量矩阵未知时的图像重建问题，通过失配方程和校准算法构建新测量矩阵，在低噪声条件下能成功重建原始图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模光纤成像需要测量值与测量矩阵严格匹配才能重建图像，但实际应用中由于系统配置未知或光纤弯曲后难以实时对准，导致测量矩阵无法获取，传统重建算法失效。

Method: 提出失配方程，设计匹配和校准解决方案算法来构建新的测量矩阵，并提供了方程和算法的详细证明。

Result: 实验结果显示在低噪声水平下，构建的矩阵可用于传统重建算法的匹配对，成功重建原始图像。算法对噪声、计算精度和正交性具有一定鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该理论解决了测量矩阵未知时的图像重建问题，具有实际应用价值，同时讨论了理论的局限性和潜在应用。

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了扩散模型和流模型在数据融合任务中的设计空间，特别关注DMSP-OLS和VIIRS夜间灯光数据的融合。研究发现基于UNet的扩散模型在保持空间细节和生成高保真融合图像方面表现最佳，并提供了噪声调度器和量化技术的选择指导。


<details>

Motivation: 数据融合在各个领域都很重要，特别是在卫星遥感中，融合多传感器观测可以提高空间和时间分辨率。本研究旨在探索扩散和流模型在数据融合中的应用，特别是针对夜间灯光数据的融合。

Method: 使用多种2D图像到图像的生成模型，包括UNET、扩散模型和流建模架构。评估这些架构在卫星遥感数据融合中的有效性，并探索噪声调度器和量化技术以优化性能。

Result: 基于UNet的扩散模型在保持细粒度空间细节和生成高保真融合图像方面表现最佳。研究还提供了噪声调度器的选择指导：迭代求解器用于更快推理，离散调度器用于更高质量重建。量化技术可在不牺牲性能的情况下优化内存效率和计算成本。

Conclusion: 研究为数据融合任务（特别是遥感应用）提供了选择最有效扩散和流模型架构的实用见解，并推荐了利用噪声调度策略来提升融合质量的建议。

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D
image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore
quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost
without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into
selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data
fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide
recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion
quality.

Motivation: 工业异常检测中融合2D和3D数据具有优势，但跨模态融合仍然具有挑战性，需要更鲁棒的融合方法。

Method: 使用共享融合编码器从RGB图像和点云创建统一潜在空间，然后通过注意力引导的模态特定解码器进行重建，通过输入特征与重建特征的误差来定位异常。

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD和Eyecandies基准测试中达到最先进水平，平均I-AUROC分别为0.972和0.901，在少样本学习设置中也表现良好。

Conclusion: MAFR为融合视觉和几何信息提供了原则性方法，提升了工业异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D
and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a
novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TITA是一个轻量级框架，通过冻结基础视觉语言模型并训练奖励模型来提供token级别的推理时对齐，减少幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的输出容易出现与视觉输入不符的幻觉问题，而现有的对齐方法要么需要昂贵的微调，要么只能提供粗粒度的延迟反馈。

Method: 提出TITA框架：冻结基础VLM，训练奖励模型来近似其分布；在推理时提取隐式偏好信号作为奖励模型与目标VLM之间的对数概率比，提供密集的自回归反馈。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和13B上的广泛评估显示，在12个基准测试中持续提升，MMVet提升8.6%，POPE提升6.7%；在Qwen2.5-VL-7B和DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B上也显示出可比的增益，特别是在减少幻觉和提升VQA准确率方面，且推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: TITA作为推理时的直接偏好优化变体，能够在不重新训练骨干网络的情况下提供token级别的纠正信号，有效增强通用理解能力并减少幻觉。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型直接采用跨领域架构，限制了多尺度时间依赖关系的有效捕捉，特别是在零样本迁移到不同模式和采样策略的数据集时表现不佳

Method: 提出层次化交错块注意力(HIBA)，使用层次化的块间和块内稀疏注意力来捕捉多尺度依赖关系。块内注意力促进局部信息交换，块间注意力捕捉全局时间模式交互和动态演化

Result: 最小模型Xihe-tiny(9.5M)超越多数当代TSFMs，展现卓越参数效率；最大模型Xihe-max(1.5B)在零样本性能上创下新记录，大幅超越先前最佳结果

Conclusion: HIBA架构具有出色的泛化能力和架构优势，在整个参数范围内都表现出一致的性能卓越

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过集成AI组件来简化视频标注任务，减轻标注人员负担，并评估其对效率、准确性和整体标注质量的实际影响。

Method: 采用单次迭代方案，使用Label Studio平台和AI驱动的零样本预标注技术，基于UCF-Crime数据集设计测试，区分视频中的正常和异常活动。

Abstract: We explore the enhancement of Human-in-the-Loop video annotation by
integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

Conclusion: 将解剖结构纳入放射学分析对于准确评估膝骨关节炎严重程度至关重要

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

TL;DR: 提出一种使用两个并行采样器在有限去噪步骤下提高扩散模型采样质量的方法，通过适当整合两个采样器在连续时间步的信息来改善图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限去噪步骤（即扩散模型评估次数有限）的情况下，如何提高采样图像的质量。

Method: 使用两个并行采样器在连续时间步进行去噪，并适当整合它们的信息到潜在图像中。该方法简单、即插即用、模型无关，无需额外微调或外部模型。

Result: 通过自动化和人工评估验证了该方法在不同扩散模型上的有效性，发现朴素的信息整合会降低采样质量，且增加更多并行采样器不一定能进一步提高质量。

Conclusion: 两个并行采样器的适当信息整合可以在有限去噪步骤下有效提高扩散模型的采样质量，但需要精心设计整合策略，且更多采样器不一定带来额外收益。

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

Conclusion: FDA-CLIP框架通过动态区域关注机制，有效提升了文本-视频检索的性能。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

Conclusion: SRE-CLIP是首个基于CLIP的DAZSL方法，有效解决了跨类别知识转移和跨模态对齐问题，在DAZSL任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

*Arpan Maity,Aviroop Pal,MD. Samiul Islam,Tamal Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合传统特征提取和深度学习的混合诊断框架，用于提高糖尿病视网膜病变的检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是糖尿病的主要并发症，早期无症状但会导致不可逆的视力丧失，特别是在糖尿病高发的印度地区，因此需要有效的早期筛查方法。

Method: 采用混合诊断框架，结合传统手工特征提取和深度学习技术。手工特征捕捉关键临床标志物，深度学习自动化层次模式识别，将可解释的临床数据与学习特征相结合。

Result: 该混合模型在分类性能上优于单独的深度学习方法，减少了假阴性结果，提高了早期诊断的准确性。

Conclusion: 这种多模态AI驱动方法能够实现可扩展、准确的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查，对糖尿病负担重的地区尤为重要。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

Abstract: This article compares the performance of six prominent object detection
algorithms, YOLOv11, RetinaNet, Fast R-CNN, YOLOv8, RT-DETR, and DETR, on the
NEU-DET surface defect detection dataset, comprising images representing
various metal surface defects, a crucial application in industrial quality
control. Each model's performance was assessed regarding detection accuracy,

capabilities and ability to process the entire image in a single forward pass,
making it faster and more efficient in detecting minor surface defects.
Additionally, YOLOv11's architecture optimizations, such as improved anchor box
generation and deeper convolutional layers, contributed to more precise
localization of defects. In conclusion, YOLOv11's outstanding performance in
accuracy and speed solidifies its position as the most effective model for
surface defect detection on the NEU dataset, surpassing competing algorithms by
a substantial margin.

TL;DR: SITS-DECO是一个基于GPT风格解码器架构的生成式地球观测基础模型，通过统一序列框架处理多任务和多模态数据，在作物分类等任务上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有地球观测模型需要额外适配、结构僵化的问题，借鉴大语言模型的统一序列预测方法，实现多任务和多模态的统一处理。

Method: 采用GPT风格解码器架构，通过符号提示进行多任务处理，利用密集时间序列建模，无需任务或模态特定的适配。

Result: 在作物类型分类任务（PASTIS-R）上超越了更大的地球观测基础模型，证明了密集时间序列建模的重要性。

Conclusion: 展示了数据驱动的建模范式，模型能力源于训练数据的多样性和结构而非架构复杂性，为未来生成式地球观测基础模型提供了概念桥梁。

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GestureGPT解决方案在识别精度和响应时间方面存在局限，无法满足自由手势理解的需求。

Method: 结合预训练大视觉语言模型进行语义对齐，引入地标处理模块嵌入解剖手部先验知识，采用思维链推理策略进行逐步语义推断。

Result: Gestura实现了稳健且适应性强的自由手势理解，并开发了首个包含30万标注问答对的开源自由手势意图推理数据集。

Conclusion: Gestura通过多组件协同工作，显著提升了自由手势理解的性能，为无约束人机交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Motivation: 分析AI图像生成模型是否准确渲染提示中明确指定的属性，以评估模型的提示保真度和潜在偏见。

Method: 使用两个公共数据集（200张文化创意行业女性图像和230张博物馆策展人图像），评估个人属性、外貌和随身物品的渲染准确性。

Result: DALL-E3在15.6%的属性（710个）中偏离了提示规范，随身物品错误率最低，个人外貌中等，人物自身描绘（特别是年龄）错误率最高。

Abstract: This study examines the prompt fidelity of ChatGPT4o / DALL-E3 text-to-image
visualisations by analysing whether attributes explicitly specified in
autogenously generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images.
Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working
in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum
curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair),
appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While
correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications
in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia,
moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person
themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable
prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN生成图像的检测在数字图像取证中面临重大挑战，需要开发更有效的检测方法来识别生成图像中的细微伪影。

Method: 使用离散小波变换（DWT）预处理，采用Haar和Daubechies小波滤波器将输入图像转换为多分辨率表示，然后输入ResNet50网络进行分类。

Result: Haar和Daubechies预处理模型的准确率分别达到93.8%和95.1%，显著高于空间域模型的81.5%。Daubechies模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: GAN生成图像在小波域具有独特的伪影或"指纹"，小波域分析在检测GAN图像方面非常有效，为未来深度伪造检测系统的发展提供了潜力。

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像诊断中潜力巨大，但大多数模型缺乏可解释性，阻碍了临床信任和采用。

Method: 使用ResNet50和DenseNet121卷积神经网络，在Kaggle数据集（7,023张脑部MRI和5,863张胸部X光）上进行训练，并集成Grad-CAM生成热力图可视化。

Result: DenseNet121表现优于ResNet50：脑肿瘤检测准确率94.3% vs 92.5%，肺炎检测准确率89.1% vs 84.4%。Grad-CAM显示DenseNet121更专注于核心病理区域。

Conclusion: 结合深度学习和可解释AI为开发可靠、可解释且临床有用的诊断工具提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging
diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase
analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially.
However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

Conclusion: 该研究成功填补了多模态抽象推理领域的数据和方法空白，证明了小模型通过适当训练框架可以在复杂抽象推理任务上超越大型模型，为多模态关系知识理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界医学数据集常存在模态不完整问题，现有方法直接推断缺失模态但忽略了模态间的分布差异，导致重建不一致不可靠。

Method: 使用类别特定流进行跨模态分布对齐，利用归一化流的可逆结构和精确密度建模能力构建分布一致的缺失模态潜在空间，并设计轻量级低秩Transformer建模模态内依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明该方法在完整模态设置下达到最先进性能，在不完整模态场景下仍保持鲁棒和优越的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效处理多模态医学生存分析中的模态缺失问题，通过分布对齐和低秩Transformer实现了鲁棒且灵活的多模态生存预测。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

Result: 混合方法在三个数据集上表现最佳：TrashNet和精炼家庭垃圾数据集达到100%准确率，垃圾分类数据集达到99.87%，超越了现有最佳基准。特征选择将特征维度降低95%以上，同时保持准确率。

Conclusion: 本研究为废物分类建立了更可靠的基准，并提出了一个高效的混合框架，在保持高准确率的同时降低推理成本，适合在资源受限环境中进行可扩展部署。

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for
scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 探索ChatGPT等大型语言模型在医学图像解释方面的潜力，特别是在零样本设置下的表现，为临床应用的可行性提供参考。

Method: 使用平衡测试集（400张图像，每类200张），比较四种不同提示设计（从最小指令到详细推理提示）在胸部X光片分类任务中的性能。

Result: 简洁的特征导向提示达到最高分类准确率74%，而推理导向提示表现较差。模型在医学图像解释方面显示出初步潜力但可靠性有限。

Conclusion: 虽然ChatGPT在医学图像解释方面展现出新兴潜力，但其诊断可靠性仍有限，需要视觉推理和领域特定适应的持续改进才能安全应用于临床实践。

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RatioWaveNet通过可训练的有理小波变换前端增强TCFormer骨干网络，在BCI-IV-2a和2b数据集上显著提升了最差受试者的分类准确率，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于运动想象的脑机接口面临非平稳性、低信噪比和受试者变异性等挑战，特别是在最难处理的受试者上表现不佳。

Method: 使用有理小波变换前端进行多分辨率子带分解，结合CNN-Transformer骨干网络进行时空特征提取和长程上下文建模。

Result: 在BCI-IV-2a和2b数据集上，最差受试者准确率分别提升0.17/0.42和1.07/2.54个百分点，平均性能也有稳定提升。

Conclusion: 可训练小波前端是增强基于Transformer的脑机接口的有效插件，能提高最差情况可靠性而不牺牲效率。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

### [43] [Modal Aphasia: Can Unified Multimodal Models Describe Images From Memory?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21842)
*Michael Aerni,Joshua Swanson,Kristina Nikolić,Florian Tramèr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前统一多模态模型存在模态失语症：能准确记忆视觉概念但无法用文字表达，尽管同时接受图像和文本训练。这导致AI安全框架存在漏洞，仅对文本进行安全对齐的模型仍能生成不安全图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现当前多模态模型存在系统性分离现象，即视觉记忆准确但文字表达能力不足，这可能对AI安全框架构成威胁。

Method: 通过合成数据集在多种架构上进行受控实验，验证模态失语症的存在，并展示仅文本对齐的模型仍能生成不安全图像的风险。

Result: 前沿模型能近乎完美地复制标志性电影艺术作品，但在文字描述中混淆关键细节。模态失语症是当前统一多模态模型的基本属性，而非训练伪影。

Conclusion: 模态失语症是当前多模态模型的根本特性，可能导致AI安全漏洞，单一模态的安全对齐不足以保护多模态系统。

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

TL;DR: SCoPE VLM是一个文档导航专家，通过链式滚动机制选择性导航文档，专注于相关片段，显著降低内存使用并模拟人类阅读行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在长上下文视觉信息理解方面的挑战，特别是在GUI控制和网页导航等代理任务中。现有方法主要扩展视觉嵌入来处理长高分辨率输入，但这些方法内存密集且不适合本地部署。

Method: 提出SCoPE VLM，采用新颖的链式滚动机制选择性递归导航文档；引入专用数据生成管道构建信息丰富的链式滚动轨迹；使用Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization强化学习方法减少训练与推理之间的差距。

Result: 方法显著减少内存使用，有效模拟人类阅读行为。SCoPE VLM是首个在多页文档问答中明确建模代理阅读模式的框架。

Conclusion: SCoPE VLM通过链式滚动机制和专用训练方法，提升了多模态代理在长上下文文档理解方面的能力，为GUI控制和网页导航等任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge
for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control
and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently
structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFCM是一种基于PFGM++的一致性模型，但只能通过蒸馏训练。本研究提出了PFCT方法，使PFCM能够独立训练，应用于低剂量CT图像去噪任务，取得了良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFCM模型只能通过蒸馏训练，这限制了其在多种数据模态中的潜力。研究目标是开发一种名为PFCT的方法，使PFCM能够独立训练。

Method: 利用扰动核去除预训练的PFGM++，引入正弦离散化调度和Beta噪声分布以提高适应性和样本质量。

Result: 在低剂量CT图像去噪任务中，PFCT在LPIPS和SSIM指标上改善了图像质量，显示出与一致性模型相似的去噪效果。

Conclusion: PFCT被证明是训练PFCM的有效方法，在CT图像去噪中显示出与其他生成模型竞争的结果，为PFCM的创建提供了更多灵活性。

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出一个三阶段混合框架，使用现代检测和视觉语言模型自动解释2D多视图工程图纸，包括布局分割、注释检测和语义内容解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手动方法、通用OCR系统或传统深度学习方法在解释复杂多视图工程图纸时的挑战，包括布局变化、方向多样和混合符号文本内容。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) YOLOv11-det进行布局分割；2) YOLOv11-obb进行方向感知的细粒度注释检测；3) 两个基于Donut的OCR-free视觉语言模型进行语义内容解析。

Result: 开发了两个专用数据集（1,000张图纸用于布局检测，1,406张用于注释级训练）。字母VLM总体F1得分为0.672，数字VLM达到0.963，在文本和定量解释方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 统一的JSON输出能够与CAD和制造数据库无缝集成，为智能工程图纸分析提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving
as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production
details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense
annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character
recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to
varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the
automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern
detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det
performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title
blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,
fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and
surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free
VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and
categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM
interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface
roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and
generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for
annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of
0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance
in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON
output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases,
providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

### [47] [LSF-Animation: Label-Free Speech-Driven Facial Animation via Implicit Feature Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21864)
*Xin Lu,Chuanqing Zhuang,Chenxi Jin,Zhengda Lu,Yiqun Wang,Wu Liu,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSF-Animation是一个无需显式情感和身份标签的语音驱动3D面部动画框架，通过从语音中隐式提取情感信息、从中性面部网格捕获身份特征，并使用分层交互融合块整合多模态信息，在未见过的说话者和情感状态上实现了更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式的一热编码表示身份和情感，需要给定情感和身份标签，限制了向未见说话者的泛化能力，且忽视了语音中固有的情感线索，影响了生成动画的自然性和适应性。

Method: 提出LSF-Animation框架，隐式从语音提取情感信息，从中性面部网格捕获身份特征；引入分层交互融合块(HIFB)，使用融合令牌整合双变换器特征，更有效地融合情感、运动和身份相关线索。

Result: 在3DMEAD数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在情感表现力、身份泛化和动画真实感方面超越了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: LSF-Animation通过消除对显式情感和身份特征表示的依赖，实现了更好的泛化能力和更自然的动画生成，为语音驱动的3D面部动画提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

TL;DR: WM-MoE是一个基于世界模型的运动预测框架，通过统一感知、时间记忆和决策制定来解决高风险角点场景的挑战。该模型利用LLM增强长期推理能力，引入MoE机制分解复杂角点案例，并在多个基准数据集上优于现有SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动预测模型在安全关键角点场景中表现不佳，主要由于训练数据中常见场景过度代表和泛化能力有限。为解决这一限制，需要开发能够处理罕见但安全关键场景的鲁棒预测框架。

Method: 提出WM-MoE框架，构建紧凑场景表示来解释当前观察、预测未来动态和评估潜在行动结果。利用LLM和轻量级时间标记器增强长期推理，引入MoE机制分解复杂角点案例，路由器将场景分配给专门专家进行意图推断和反事实推演。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（nuScenes、NGSIM、HighD和MoCAD）上的广泛实验表明，WM-MoE始终优于SOTA基线方法，在角点案例和数据缺失条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于世界模型的架构为全自动驾驶汽车中鲁棒和可泛化的运动预测展示了前景，WM-MoE框架在角点场景中表现出色，表明其在安全关键应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban
planning, effective environmental monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of
climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate
technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the
lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for
estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically
computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed
methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can
foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and
healthier future.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive
modeling, exemplified by models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational
framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of
CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones.
TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules,
preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency
computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TernaryCLIP can
achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98
$\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$
storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while
maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and
image-text retrieval tasks across 41 commonly used datasets. Our work
highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models,
supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.
The model and code can be accessed from Hugging Face and GitHub.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning based generative models, particularly
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and
Diffusion Models (DMs), have been instrumental in in generating diverse,
high-quality content across various domains, such as image and video synthesis.
This capability has led to widespread adoption of these models and has captured

this need, this survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the
literature and provides a cohesive framework for understanding the development
of GANs, VAEs, and DMs, including their many variants and combined approaches.
We highlight key innovations that have improved the quality, diversity, and
controllability of generated outputs, reflecting the expanding potential of
generative artificial intelligence. In addition to summarizing technical
progress, we examine rising ethical concerns, including the risks of misuse and
the broader societal impact of synthetic media. Finally, we outline persistent
challenges and propose future research directions, offering a structured and
forward looking perspective for researchers in this fast evolving field.

TL;DR: SPRINT是一种高效的扩散变换器训练方法，通过分层令牌丢弃策略实现高达75%的令牌丢弃率，同时保持生成质量，训练成本降低9.8倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)在生成性能上表现优异，但其二次训练成本使得大规模预训练极其昂贵。现有令牌丢弃方法要么参数过多，要么在高丢弃率下效果不佳。

Method: 利用浅层和深层互补作用：浅层处理所有令牌捕获局部细节，深层处理稀疏子集减少计算，通过残差连接融合输出。采用两阶段训练：长掩码预训练+短全令牌微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，SPRINT实现9.8倍训练节省，FID/FDD指标相当；推理时PDG方法几乎减半FLOPs同时提升质量。

Conclusion: SPRINT为高效DiT训练提供了一个简单、有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance
but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale
pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as
a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

Result: 在三个胸部X射线数据集上的实验表明，Lite-Diff相比完整微调实现了更优的适应效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型中的迁移学习提供了有前景的方向，促进了其在各种低数据领域的部署。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

Abstract: Sign languages play a crucial role in the communication of deaf communities,
but they are often marginalized, limiting access to essential services such as
healthcare and education. This study proposes an automatic sign language
recognition system based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, using Mediapipe for
gesture keypoint extraction. Developed with Python, TensorFlow and Streamlit,
the system provides real-time gesture translation. The results show an average
accuracy of 92\%, with very good performance for distinct gestures such as
``Hello'' and ``Thank you''. However, some confusions remain for visually
similar gestures, such as ``Call'' and ``Yes''. This work opens up interesting
perspectives for applications in various fields such as healthcare, education
and public services.

Conclusion: 基于字幕的XAI方法能有效提高模型鲁棒性，为开发更稳健的机器学习模型做出重要贡献。

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

*Hyeonsu Kang,Emily Bao,Anjan Goswami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VLM-SlideEval评估框架，用于测试视觉语言模型在幻灯片理解方面的能力，包括元素提取、抗干扰性和高级理解三个维度。研究发现当前VLMs在像素级提取和跨幻灯片叙事结构理解方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型越来越多地用于评估多模态内容（包括演示幻灯片），但它们在幻灯片特定理解方面的能力尚未得到充分探索，特别是在作为智能代理流程中的评估者角色时。

Method: 使用从Zenodo公开数据集获取的幻灯片，通过PowerPoint XML和实时渲染标准化元素元数据，构建统一的验证模式。从三个维度评估VLMs：元素级提取、对几何/样式/文本扰动的鲁棒性、以及高级理解能力。

Result: 实证研究表明，VLMs在像素级精确提取方面表现不佳，在受控扰动下显示出非平凡的协议性、保真度和一致性，在单张幻灯片内容理解方面表现较好，但无法可靠地捕捉跨幻灯片的叙事结构。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在幻灯片评估方面存在局限性，需要开发经过校准的、评估者在环的评估器，以推动智能代理流程中的迭代优化和选择。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal
content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding
remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic,
model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework
that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide
images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in
geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as
recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly
available decks from Zenodo
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we
standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live
renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop
evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合人体检测跟踪和时空建模的监控视频异常检测方法，在UCF-Crime数据集上达到92.41%的平均准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监控视频异常检测面临的异常事件多样性、类别不平衡和场景依赖的视觉干扰等问题

Method: 使用YOLO-World检测人体实例，ByteTrack进行身份跟踪，高斯模糊抑制背景，InceptionV3提取空间特征，BiLSTM建模时序动态

Result: 在五类异常检测任务中平均测试准确率达92.41%，各类别F1分数均超过0.85，表现出良好的泛化能力和类别不平衡鲁棒性

Conclusion: 前景聚焦的预处理方法显著提升了真实监控场景中的异常检测性能

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

*Zheng Qi,Chao Shang,Evangelia Spiliopoulou,Nikolaos Pappas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GIFT方法，通过跟踪视觉注意力在理解用户查询时的正向变化（"凝视转移"）来预计算整体视觉显著性图，在解码过程中同时增强对显著视觉信息和用户查询的关注，从而减少VLMs中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要归因于VLMs过度依赖语言先验知识而非视觉输入，并试图通过按注意力分数比例放大视觉标记注意力来缓解幻觉。但这些方法忽视了视觉注意力沉没问题（注意力常被错误分配到任务无关的视觉区域），且忽略了跨模态融合平衡，仅增强视觉注意力而不调整对用户查询的关注，可能导致放大错误区域且无法正确理解用户查询。

Method: GIFT方法预计算整体视觉显著性图，通过跟踪用户查询理解过程中的视觉注意力正向变化（"凝视转移"），并利用该图在每一步解码过程中同时增强对显著视觉信息和用户查询的关注。

Result: 大量实验表明，GIFT在生成和分类任务中都能有效减少VLMs的幻觉，相比贪婪解码实现了高达20.7%的改进，同时以低计算开销保持了一般的视觉语言性能。

Conclusion: GIFT通过解决视觉注意力沉没问题并确保平衡的跨模态融合，有效缓解了VLMs中的幻觉问题，在保持性能的同时实现了显著的改进。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像的3D T1加权脑MRI协调框架，通过分离解剖内容与扫描仪和站点特定变化，使用SSIM损失保持生物学特征同时减少站点间变异性，显著提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描仪型号、采集协议和成像站点的差异导致多中心研究分析不一致和泛化性差，需要解决跨站点图像协调问题。

Method: 使用基于结构相似性指数(SSIM)的可微分损失函数，分别评估图像亮度、对比度和结构成分，通过多风格目标训练实现图像协调。

Result: 协调后结构SSIM达0.97，亮度SSIM达0.98-0.99，Wasserstein距离显著降低；脑年龄预测MAE从5.36年降至3.30年，阿尔茨海默病分类AUC从0.78提升至0.85。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了跨站点图像一致性，保持了解剖保真度，并显著改善了下游模型性能，为大规模多中心神经影像研究提供了稳健且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态大语言模型在坐标预测任务中的位置编码问题，提出了一种无需训练的方法VPSG来纠正位置偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但在精确坐标预测方面存在困难，特别是在高分辨率输入时，长token序列会削弱位置编码并引入方向性偏差。

Method: 通过分析位置编码扰动对模型行为的影响，提出Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG)方法，利用辅助解码和轻量级有限状态机来纠正坐标预测偏差。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验表明，VPSG能可靠地改善坐标预测性能，证明了位置编码鲁棒性对空间推理的重要性。

Conclusion: 位置编码失败是MLLM精确坐标预测的关键瓶颈，VPSG通过利用偏差的方向性特性实现了有效的校正。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过修改随机种子或多样化输入提示来生成多样图像，但难以区分有意义的差异，且口头可解释的多样性有限。需要一种能处理条件不确定性并生成多样化合理图像的方法。

Method: 在提示表示计算中集成潜在图（由GFlowNets参数化），利用GFlowNets的高级图采样能力捕获不确定性并生成多样化的轨迹，从而产生多样化的条件表示和对应的输出图像。

Result: 在自然图像和医学图像数据集上的评估表明，Rainbow在图像合成、图像生成和反事实生成任务中，在多样性和保真度方面都有所提升。

Conclusion: Rainbow框架能有效处理条件不确定性，生成多样化的合理图像，适用于任何预训练的条件生成模型。

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Result: 在BDD100k、NuImages和Waymo数据集上生成了850万高质量VQA对，人类验证准确率达到91.16%（相比现有方法的57.6%）。模型在6种问题类型上微调后，能在10多种保留类型上泛化，BDD和NuImages上的准确率分别提升47.5%和37.9%。

Conclusion: GRAID通过2D几何基元方法能够生成高质量的空间推理数据集，显著提升视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，并具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated
accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work.

Motivation: 当前深度立体匹配方法在基准数据集上表现良好，但缺乏其他视觉任务中基础模型的零样本泛化能力，特别是在挑战性区域如遮挡或弱纹理处表现不足。

Method: CogStereo将单目深度特征作为先验嵌入到细化过程中，采用双条件细化机制，结合像素级不确定性和认知引导特征，实现全局一致的误匹配校正。

Result: 在Scene Flow、KITTI、Middlebury、ETH3D、EuRoc和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，CogStereo不仅达到最先进的结果，而且在跨域泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CogStereo将立体视觉推向认知驱动的方法，即使在几何信息不足的区域也能确保结构一致的视差估计。

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided
features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments
on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that
CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in
cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven
approach.

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现良好，但对输入损坏引起的分布偏移很脆弱。本文旨在研究损坏如何影响CLIP的图像嵌入，并找到提升鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 提出了Mint方法，这是一种简单的测试时适应方法，使用均值累加器和梯度累加器在线最大化基于伪标签的类间方差。该方法在小批量情况下也能有效工作。

Result: Mint方法在多个损坏基准测试和CLIP架构上一致地提升了性能，证明了最大化类间方差可以有效改善嵌入质量。

Conclusion: 嵌入方差崩溃是CLIP在损坏数据上性能下降的关键原因，而通过最大化类间方差可以显著提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自我中心视觉基准主要忽略情感状态对行为的影响，假设中性情感和统一人格，限制了视觉系统捕捉行为内部驱动因素的能力。

Method: 使用Meta的Project Aria眼镜收集43名参与者的同步眼动视频、光电容积描记、惯性运动数据和生理基线，参与者完成情感诱发任务和自然活动，使用Circumplex模型和Mikels轮进行情感自我报告，使用大五人格模型进行人格评估。

Result: 基于经典学习方法的简单基线在真实世界情感预测中，从自我中心视觉系统捕获的信号比处理生理信号产生更好的估计。

Conclusion: 该数据集将情感和人格确立为自我中心感知的核心维度，为基于情感的行为、意图和交互建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LOC框架有效解决了3D场景理解中的开放集挑战，通过语言引导和密集对比学习实现了优异的性能，为3D视觉语言模型的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

Conclusion: ARFNet框架有效缓解了无源域自适应中的负迁移和域偏移问题，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

TL;DR: I2-NeRF：一种增强3D物理世界感知的神经辐射场框架，通过反向分层上采样策略实现等距采样，并提出了统一的辐射传输模型来处理介质退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF模型主要依赖物体中心采样，缺乏对3D空间的均匀采样能力，且在介质退化环境（如水下、雾霾、低光场景）中的物理感知能力有限。

Method: 提出反向分层上采样策略实现近均匀3D空间采样；建立统一的辐射传输模型，结合Beer-Lambert衰减定律，将发射、吸收和散射统一为粒子模型；通过组合直接辐射和介质诱导的内散射辐射来处理复杂介质环境。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有方法显著提高了重建保真度和物理合理性，能够实现各向同性的度量感知，甚至可以估计介质属性如水深。

Conclusion: I2-NeRF通过改进采样策略和辐射传输模型，有效增强了神经辐射场在复杂介质环境中的等距和各向同性度量感知能力，为生成式AI的3D物理世界感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: 联合利用模型内部信念和输出概率分布能有效提升VLMs不确定性估计性能，HARMONY框架为高风险应用中的VLM可靠性评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管图像生成模型在规模和架构上取得了显著进展，但其工作机制仍然不透明。本研究旨在剥离复杂的工程技巧，探索一个简单、非参数的生成模型来理解自然图像的基本结构。

Method: 基于自然图像的三个原则设计模型：空间非平稳性、低层规律性和高层语义。每个像素的分布由其局部上下文窗口定义，无需训练参数。

Result: 该模型在MNIST上生成高保真样本，在CIFAR-10上生成视觉上引人注目的图像。模型的白盒特性允许对生成机制进行深入分析。

Conclusion: 这种简单性与强经验性能的结合指向了自然图像结构的最小理论。分析揭示了"部分-整体泛化"的简单组合过程，为大型神经网络生成模型如何学习泛化提供了假设。

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

Motivation: 随着建筑行业对更快、更安全、更高效流程的需求增长，场外施工带来了新的安全风险。传统方法难以适应建筑环境的动态性和不可预测性，而现有数据驱动方法在捕捉长期行为和空间社交背景方面仍面临挑战。

Result: TrajGATFormer在4.8秒预测范围内实现ADE 1.25米和FDE 2.3米；TrajGATFormer-Obstacle实现更高精度(ADE 1.15米，FDE 2.2米)。相比传统方法，ADE和FDE分别降低高达35%和38%。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架和模型显著提高了轨迹预测精度，能够更好地捕捉时空交互，为建筑工地碰撞避免系统的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.
TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3
m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both
workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m).
Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing
ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in

Conclusion: GALA是一种简单有效的多源主动域自适应方法，能够显著减少标注成本，同时保持高性能，具有很好的实用价值

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

*Kunyang Zhou,Yeqin Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的车道线检测方法DiffusionLane，将车道检测任务建模为车道参数空间中的去噪扩散过程，通过混合解码策略和辅助训练头提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统车道检测方法在特征表示和检测性能方面存在局限，需要一种能够处理噪声并提升泛化能力的新方法。

Method: 使用高斯噪声对真实车道参数进行扰动，通过渐进式去噪学习目标车道；设计了结合全局和局部解码器的混合扩散解码器；在训练阶段使用辅助头增强编码器特征表示。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优异：Carlane上超越现有方法至少1%准确率；CULane上F1分数81.32%；Tusimple上准确率96.89%；LLAMAS上F1分数97.59%。

Conclusion: DiffusionLane具有强大的泛化能力和有前景的检测性能，在多个数据集上超越了现有最先进方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and
97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer
vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while
operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we
present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation
leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained
Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The
model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision
on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while
enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were
applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip
connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable
and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our
implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second
(FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate
the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and
off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for
implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time
applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power
efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. The code for this project is

Motivation: 现有方法依赖模糊的二元监督（将所有事故视频帧标记为正样本），而风险随时间连续变化，导致不可靠学习和误报。

Method: 使用片段级编码器联合建模时空动态，基于Transformer的时间解码器使用专用时间查询同时预测所有未来时间范围的事故分数。

Conclusion: 提出的新范式通过直接预测未来事故分数，解决了现有方法的局限性，在保持可接受误报率的同时提高了预测准确性。

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

Motivation: 空中-地面行人重识别面临极端视角差异、遮挡和域差距等挑战，现有方法在处理严重姿态变化和空间不对齐方面仍有局限。

Method: GSAlign网络包含两个关键组件：可学习薄板样条(LTPS)模块自适应扭曲行人特征补偿几何变化，动态对齐模块(DAM)估计可见性感知表示掩码在语义层面突出可见身体区域。

Conclusion: GSAlign通过联合处理几何和语义不对齐，有效解决了空中-地面行人重识别中的极端视角变化和遮挡问题，为跨视角行人匹配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

Abstract: Large-scale and high-quality image-text pair datasets play an important role
in developing high-performing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we
introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset
containing approximately 155 million examples, collected from Common Crawl. Our
dataset construction pipeline employs various techniques, including filtering

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and
interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these
limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce
\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist
socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with
emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines,
improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban
contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators.
This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable
and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

TL;DR: GRPO-Guard通过重要性比率归一化和梯度重加权解决了GRPO强化学习中的隐式过优化问题，稳定了流匹配模型的训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO框架中重要性比率分布存在系统性偏移（均值低于1且方差不一致），导致PPO裁剪机制无法有效约束过度自信的正向更新，造成隐式过优化问题。

Method: 提出GRPO-Guard方法，包含比率归一化（恢复平衡且步长一致的重要性比率）和梯度重加权（均衡不同噪声条件下的策略梯度）两个核心设计。

Result: 在多个扩散骨干模型（如SD3.5M、Flux.1-dev）和多样化代理任务上的实验表明，GRPO-Guard显著减少了过优化，同时保持甚至提高了生成质量。

Conclusion: GRPO-Guard作为一种调节裁剪机制，能够稳定优化过程，显著缓解隐式过优化，且不依赖繁重的KL正则化。

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

Conclusion: 基于图的机制在自监督表示学习中非常有效，能够显著提升模型性能，代码已公开

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了MindHier框架，通过分层自回归建模实现从fMRI到图像的重建，解决了现有扩散方法中固定引导导致层次神经信息崩溃的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法通常将fMRI活动映射到单个高层嵌入，作为整个生成过程的固定引导。但这种固定引导会压缩层次神经信息，且与图像重建的阶段需求不匹配。

Method: 提出MindHier框架，包含三个组件：分层fMRI编码器提取多级神经嵌入、层次到层次对齐方案强制与CLIP特征的逐层对应、尺度感知的粗到细神经引导策略在匹配尺度注入嵌入到自回归中。

Result: 在NSD数据集上的实验表明，MindHier实现了更优的语义保真度，推理速度快4.67倍，且比基于扩散的基线方法产生更确定性的结果。

Conclusion: MindHier通过分层重建过程（先合成全局语义再细化局部细节）提供了一个高效且认知对齐的替代方案，类似于人类视觉感知。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

Abstract: Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \&
product design and creative industries to control 3D object features accurately
in image space. Traditional 3D editing approaches are time-consuming and demand
specialized skills, while current image-based generative methods lack accuracy
in geometric conditioning. To address these challenges, we propose
GeoDiffusion, a training-free framework for accurate and efficient geometric
conditioning of 3D features in image generation. GeoDiffusion employs a
class-specific 3D object as a geometric prior to define keypoints and
parametric correlations in 3D space. We ensure viewpoint consistency through a
rendered image of a reference 3D object, followed by style transfer to meet
user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is
GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry
guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench. Our results demonstrate
that GeoDiffusion enables precise geometric modifications across various
iterative design workflows.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent
state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and
3D reconstruction. Code and model weights can be found in project repository:

Conclusion: T2SMark通过创新的尾部截断采样和两阶段框架，成功解决了噪声水印方法在鲁棒性和多样性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing
high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property
protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion
models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as
specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the
infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the
generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing
the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to
balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve
strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which
degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile
for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a
two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike
prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances
robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while
randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our
two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly
generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on
diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show
that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code

imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

Abstract: We present a fully interpretable and flexible statistical method for
background subtraction in roadside LiDAR data, aimed at enhancing
infrastructure-based perception in automated driving. Our approach introduces
both a Gaussian distribution grid (GDG), which models the spatial statistics of
the background using background-only scans, and a filtering algorithm that uses
this representation to classify LiDAR points as foreground or background. The
method supports diverse LiDAR types, including multiline 360 degree and
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, and adapts to various
configurations. Evaluated on the publicly available RCooper dataset, it
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and flexibility, even with
minimal background data. Its efficient implementation ensures reliable
performance on low-resource hardware, enabling scalable real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出TDSR框架，将图像描述重新定义为目标导向的分层细化规划问题，通过高效的MCTS算法显著提升VLMs在细节描述、组合泛化和幻觉抑制方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图像描述中存在固有矛盾：强大的单步生成能力导致短视决策，难以在保持全局叙事连贯性的同时捕捉丰富细节。

Method: 将生成过程建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出基于视觉引导并行扩展和轻量级价值网络的高效MCTS算法，大幅减少对昂贵VLM的调用频率。

Result: 在DetailCaps、COMPOSITIONCAP和POPE等多个基准测试中，TDSR作为即插即用模块显著提升了现有VLMs的性能，在细粒度描述、组合泛化和幻觉抑制方面达到最先进或极具竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: TDSR框架成功解决了VLMs在图像描述中的全局连贯性与细节丰富性之间的矛盾，通过高效的规划算法实现了性能的显著提升。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

Motivation: 解决可穿戴辅助代理中的目标推断问题，消除用户与代理交互所需的努力，通过创建强基准来衡量视觉语言模型在此问题上的进展。

Method: 收集了包含视觉、音频、数字和纵向上下文观察的多模态数据集，涵盖348名参与者的3,477条记录，并进行了模态消融实验。

Result: 人类表现达到93%的多选准确率，而最佳视觉语言模型为84%；生成式基准显示较大模型表现更好，但仅55%的时间产生相关目标，距离实际应用仍有差距。

Conclusion: 模型能从相关模态的额外信息中受益，无关模态的性能下降最小，但当前模型距离实际可用性还有很大差距。

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

Conclusion: 该半监督框架能够有效利用未标注的冷冻电子断层扫描数据，显著提升蛋白质粒子拾取的性能，为解决该领域的主要瓶颈提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach
improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of
semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

Conclusion: DynaPose4D不仅验证了该框架的有效性，还展示了其在计算机视觉和动画制作领域的潜在应用前景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in
camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative
solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential
applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

Conclusion: 提出的角度多样性知识增强方法能够有效提升知识蒸馏性能，同时保持计算效率，具有良好的兼容性和实用性。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play
fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

Motivation: 传统基于幅度的MRI模态（如T1w）对帕金森病病理敏感性不足，而定量磁化率成像（QSM）能更好地量化深部灰质核团中的铁沉积，但现有方法未能充分利用这两种模态的优势。

Method: 设计门控融合模块，学习模态特异性注意力权重和通道级门控向量进行选择性特征调制，通过分层门控机制增强ROI感知特征并抑制无关信号。

Result: 方法在三个现有最先进方法中表现最优，达到85.00%准确率和92.06% AUC。消融研究验证了ROI引导、多模态整合和融合定位的贡献。

Conclusion: GateFuseNet通过自适应多模态融合有效提升了帕金森病的MRI诊断性能，Grad-CAM可视化证实模型聚焦于临床相关病理区域。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging
due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing
methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as
T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that
quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we
propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates
QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion
module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating
vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism
enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further
validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion
positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically
relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be

Conclusion: ORIG框架通过开放多模态检索有效解决了事实图像生成中的知识矛盾问题，为生成既逼真又事实准确的图像提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

Method: 使用VMamba图像编码器，结合新颖的MCAB注意力机制和transformer解码器，进行端到端的基于排名的图像裁剪，显式编码构图线索。

Result: 大量实验表明AesCrop在定量指标和定性评估上都优于当前最先进的方法，生成更美观的裁剪结果。

Conclusion: 通过显式整合构图指导，AesCrop在图像裁剪任务中实现了更好的全局性和多样性，证明了构图知识在美学驱动图像裁剪中的重要性。

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，SRSR在所有数据集的标准保真度指标（PSNR和SSIM）上均优于7个最先进基线，在真实基准的感知质量指标（LPIPS和DISTS）上也表现优异。

Conclusion: SRSR框架在超分辨率任务中实现了高语义保真度和感知质量，有效解决了语义模糊和幻觉问题。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于XLFM（扩展光场显微镜）3D重建的新方法，包括XLFM-Zebrafish基准数据集、自监督的MVN-LF任务和物理约束的ORC损失函数，在斑马鱼数据集上PSNR提升了7.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决XLFM中基于学习的3D重建的两个核心挑战：缺乏标准化数据集和缺乏能有效建模角空间结构且保持物理基础的方法。

Method: 构建XLFM-Zebrafish基准数据集；提出MVN-LF自监督任务学习角度先验；设计ORC损失函数通过可微分渲染约束确保预测体积与PSF前向投影的一致性。

Result: 在XLFM-Zebrafish基准测试中，该方法比现有最优基线PSNR提升了7.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合数据驱动学习和物理约束，显著提升了XLFM的3D重建质量，为神经科学中的大规模神经成像提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出PFED框架，通过层次知识蒸馏和多视图表示精炼，实现高效跨视角地理定位，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有跨视角地理定位方法依赖资源密集型细粒度特征提取，导致推理成本高、难以在边缘设备部署的问题。

Method: 1) 训练阶段：层次蒸馏范式(HD-CVGL)结合不确定性感知预测对齐(UAPA)；2) 推理阶段：多视图精炼模块(MRM)利用互信息过滤冗余样本。

Result: 在University-1652数据集上达到97.15% Recall@1，计算量减少5倍以上，速度提升3倍，在AGX Orin边缘设备上达到251.5 FPS。

Conclusion: PFED在精度和效率方面均达到最先进水平，证明了其在实时无人机应用中的实际可行性。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on
University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3
\times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS
on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for
real-time UAV applications. The project is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSScreen V2是一个部分监督的自训练框架，用于多种视网膜疾病筛查，通过三分支架构解决标签缺失和域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法依赖完全标注或单域数据集，无法有效处理多个部分标注且分布不同的数据集中的标签缺失和域偏移挑战。

Method: 采用三分支架构：教师分支从弱增强图像生成伪标签解决标签缺失；两个学生分支分别使用低频丢弃(LF-Dropout)增强域鲁棒性，以及低频不确定性(LF-Uncert)通过对抗学习的高斯扰动估计不确定域变异性。

Result: 在多个域内和域外眼底数据集上的实验表明，PSScreen V2实现了最先进的性能和优越的域泛化能力，与包括DINOv2在内的多种骨干网络兼容，并在胸部X射线数据集上验证了框架的通用性。

Conclusion: PSScreen V2是一个通用且适应性强的框架，能有效处理部分标注和多域数据，在视网膜疾病筛查任务中表现出色。

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种投影嵌入扩散桥模型(PEDB)，通过引入新的反向随机微分方程，在采样过程中同时考虑FBP重建和投影数据，从而自然融入数据一致性，在三种不完整CT数据重建任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散桥模型主要从FBP重建恢复干净图像，但如何将投影数据一致性融入这些模型仍未被充分探索。数据一致性可以提高重建保真度和细节恢复能力。

Method: 提出PEDB模型，设计新的反向SDE从干净图像的条件分布中采样，该分布同时以FBP重建和投影数据为条件。将投影数据嵌入到反向SDE的分数函数中，并引入参数控制随机性水平，设计离散化方案减少误差。

Result: 在稀疏视图、有限角度和截断投影三种不完整CT数据重建任务中，PEDB在标准、噪声和域迁移评估中都优于现有最先进的扩散桥模型。

Conclusion: PEDB通过显式地将投影数据条件化到采样过程中，自然地融入了数据一致性，在多种不完整CT数据重建场景下都取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWAN是一个三阶段的自监督小波神经网络，用于从高光谱图像中联合估计端元和丰度。该方法通过小波变换、自监督学习和物理建模实现无监督解混，在合成和真实数据集上表现出优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像解混是遥感领域的重要问题，传统方法需要地面真实数据。本文旨在开发一种无需地面真实数据的自监督方法，通过小波变换和神经网络联合估计端元和丰度。

Method: 三阶段自监督小波神经网络：1) SWANencoder将小波系数映射到低维潜在空间；2) SWANdecoder重建输入小波系数；3) SWANforward学习高光谱图像的物理特性。使用三阶段联合损失函数和Adam优化器。

Result: 在两个合成数据集和三个真实高光谱数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估中均优于现有的基于神经网络的解混方法，同时具有鲁棒性和紧凑的网络参数。

Conclusion: SWAN通过自监督学习实现了有效的高光谱图像解混，无需地面真实数据，在性能和实用性方面均有显著提升，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact
network parameters for practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业应用中缺乏大规模标注牲畜数据集的问题，探索跨物种迁移学习在奶牛姿态估计中的潜力与局限。

Method: 使用ZebraPose（基于视觉Transformer的模型，在合成斑马图像上训练）进行27个关键点检测，在奶牛真实谷仓条件下评估三种配置：自定义农场数据集、APT-36K基准子集及其组合。

Result: 组合模型在分布内数据上表现良好（AP=0.86，AR=0.87，PCK 0.5=0.869），但在未见过的谷仓和牛群上出现显著泛化失败。

Conclusion: 合成到真实域的差距是农业AI部署的主要障碍，物种间形态相似性不足以支持跨域迁移，需要农业优先的AI设计方法。

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts,
achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and
specificity 80.9% on the official test set. These results indicate that
combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive
objectives yields a robust, domain-generalizable framework for atypical mitosis
classification suitable for real-world computational pathology workflows.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成方面表现出色，但对其输出进行精确控制和针对性编辑仍然具有挑战性。现有方法通常依赖大量图像采样或训练辅助网络，效率较低。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型中自注意力权重矩阵编码的结构信息，通过计算这些矩阵的特征向量来直接推导语义编辑方向，无需额外数据或模型微调。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、无需额外训练的方式来获取扩散模型中的可解释语义编辑方向，显著提升了编辑效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while
reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

Conclusion: SARCLIP成功弥合了SAR图像与文本描述之间的语义鸿沟，为SAR领域提供了首个有效的视觉语言基础模型。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

Conclusion: Alias-Free ViT通过消除混叠效应和使用平移等变注意力机制，有效提升了Vision Transformers的平移鲁棒性，同时保持了良好的分类性能。

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

TL;DR: DAMap是一种改进的高清地图构建方法，通过距离感知焦点损失、混合损失方案和任务调制可变形注意力来解决当前方法中的任务不对齐问题，在NuScenes和Argoverse2基准测试中取得了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高清地图元素预测方法在高质量预测方面表现不佳，主要由于任务不对齐问题：1）由于一对多匹配查询共享相同标签导致的不适当任务标签；2）任务共享采样机制导致的次优任务特征。

Method: DAMap包含三个组件：距离感知焦点损失（DAFL）为匹配样本分配适当分类标签，任务调制可变形注意力（TMDA）获取判别性任务特定特征，混合损失方案（HLS）更好地利用DAFL的优势。

Result: 在NuScenes和Argoverse2基准测试的不同指标、基线、分割、主干网络和训练计划下，DAMap始终实现了性能改进。

Conclusion: DAMap通过解决任务不对齐问题，有效提升了高清地图元素预测的质量，在分类和定位得分方面都有显著改进。

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

*Hibiki Ayabe,Kazushi Okamoto,Koki Karube,Atsushi Shibata,Kei Harada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于立面图像的多任务学习模型，预测日本建筑的结构防火等级，通过联合估计建造年份、建筑结构和物业类型来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日本二手房市场中关键建筑元数据（如建造年份和结构类型）经常缺失或过时，这影响了灾害风险评估和保险定价。

Method: 使用多任务学习模型从立面图像联合预测建造年份、建筑结构和物业类型，然后基于官方保险标准通过规则映射推导结构防火等级（H-非防火、T-半防火、M-防火）。

Result: 模型在建造年份回归和跨不平衡类别的分类中实现了高准确率，定性分析显示模型能够捕捉与建筑年龄和材料相关的视觉线索。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了基于图像的可扩展、可解释风险分析系统的可行性，在保险、城市规划和灾害准备方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban
planning, and disaster preparedness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVG图形在数字设计和机器人控制中至关重要，不仅编码视觉结构，还包含运动路径。需要一种能够根据多种输入信号生成高质量SVG的统一框架。

Method: RoboSVG框架首先根据输入查询生成多模态指导，然后通过专用生成模块合成候选SVG，最后在数值指导下进行细化以产生高质量输出。

Result: 实验表明，RoboSVG在查询符合度和视觉保真度方面表现出色，在多种SVG生成任务中达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: RoboSVG为多功能SVG生成建立了新的技术标准，其数据集和源代码将公开发布。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive
generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity
across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation.
The dataset and source code of this project will be publicly available soon.

*Wenlong Li,Yifei Xu,Yuan Rao,Zhenhua Wang,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VADTree方法，利用分层粒度感知树结构进行视频异常检测的灵活采样，通过预训练模型识别事件边界，结合视觉语言模型和大语言模型进行异常感知和推理，在无需训练的情况下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法中，有监督方法需要大量训练数据且缺乏解释性，而无训练方法使用固定长度时间窗口采样难以准确捕捉不同时间跨度的异常事件。

Method: 使用分层粒度感知树结构进行灵活采样，基于预训练通用事件边界检测模型识别潜在异常事件边界，将视频分解为通用事件节点，进行自适应粗细分层结构和冗余移除，然后注入多维先验到视觉语言模型增强节点异常感知，通过大语言模型实现通用事件节点的异常推理，最后使用簇间节点关联方法整合多粒度异常分数。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数据集上进行广泛实验，VADTree在无需训练设置下实现了最先进的性能，同时大幅减少了采样的视频片段数量。

Conclusion: VADTree方法通过灵活的分层采样和结合预训练模型的知识，有效解决了视频异常检测中不同时间跨度异常事件的识别问题，在减少计算成本的同时提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Windsock和DANCE方法来解决多模态检索增强生成中的三个关键挑战：何时检索、选择什么模态、如何有效利用检索信息，显著提升了生成质量并减少了检索次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态检索增强生成方法存在静态检索策略、不灵活的模态选择和检索信息利用不足的问题，导致确定何时检索、选择什么模态以及如何有效利用检索信息成为关键挑战。

Method: 引入Windsock模块进行检索必要性和模态选择的决策，提出DANCE指令调优的自适应训练策略增强检索信息利用能力，采用自评估方法将问答数据集转换为MRAG训练数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了17.07%的生成质量，同时减少了8.95%的检索次数。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了多模态检索增强生成中的关键挑战，在提升生成质量的同时降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveMAE是一个为多光谱卫星图像设计的掩码自编码框架，通过离散小波变换分离频率分量并学习尺度感知的高频表示，结合地理条件位置编码，在多个下游任务中实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于遥感领域标注数据稀缺，完全监督方法适用性有限，需要开发自监督学习方法来构建基础模型。

Method: 使用多级离散小波变换分离频率分量，引导编码器学习尺度感知的高频表示；提出地理条件位置编码，通过球面谐波整合地理先验知识。

Result: 在PANGAEA基准测试的多个下游任务中，WaveMAE相比先前最先进方法实现了一致的性能提升，在分割和回归任务上获得显著增益；轻量级版本仅使用26.4%参数也能达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: WaveMAE被确立为一个强大且具有地理信息感知的多光谱遥感图像基础模型。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT)，一个统一的端到端transformer模型，通过3D一致性对比学习策略，从2D视觉输入中学习同时包含几何结构和实例级语义的统一表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将3D几何重建和高级空间理解分开处理，忽略了这两个基本维度之间的关键相互作用，导致在下游3D理解任务中泛化能力差、性能不佳。

Method: 设计3D一致性对比学习策略，通过2D视觉输入引导IGGT编码包含几何结构和实例级聚类的统一表示；构建InsScene-15K大规模数据集，包含高质量RGB图像、位姿、深度图和3D一致性实例级掩码标注。

Result: 该方法支持将2D视觉输入一致地提升到具有明确不同对象实例的连贯3D场景中。

Conclusion: IGGT通过统一几何重建和实例级上下文理解，解决了现有方法中几何与语义分离的问题，提高了3D场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

Abstract: Lipreading has emerged as an increasingly important research area for

word-level lipreading dataset, comprising $743$ target words and over
$414{,}000$ video samples extracted from more than $1{,}900$ hours of footage

Speech Recognition(ASR), active-speaker localization, quality filtering, and
pose/mask screening. We further fine-tune two widely used lipreading
architectures on LRW-Persian, establishing reference performance and
demonstrating the difficulty of Persian visual speech recognition. By filling a

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决糖尿病足溃疡检测中公开数据集稀缺和变异性的挑战，以及类别不平衡问题。

Method: 使用ConvNeXt块提取局部特征，结合CBAM和DANet注意力机制，集成Transformer模块增强长距离依赖建模，并采用数据增强处理类别不平衡。

Result: 在DFUC2021和DFU数据集上，单次实验准确率0.8961，精确率0.9160；4折交叉验证准确率0.9755，标准差仅0.0031，优于现有CNN和ViT模型。

Conclusion: ConMatFormer为糖尿病足溃疡分类设立了新基准，提供了可解释的混合注意力Transformer框架用于医学图像分析。

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

*Jiaxiang Liu,Jiawei Du,Xiao Liu,Prayag Tiwari,Mingkun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC)方法，通过语义一致性和空间一致性模块增强CLIP模型在零样本设置下的对抗鲁棒性，无需对抗微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本场景下表现出色，但对对抗扰动高度脆弱。现有防御方法依赖带标签数据的对抗微调，限制了在零样本设置中的应用。

Method: SCC包含两个互补模块：语义一致性利用反攻击预热生成的软伪标签和多视图预测来正则化跨模态对齐；空间一致性通过增强视图对齐扰动视觉预测，稳定对抗扰动下的推理。

Result: 在22个基准测试和多种攻击设置下的广泛实验表明，SCC能持续提升CLIP的零样本鲁棒性，同时保持准确性，并可无缝集成到其他视觉语言模型中。

Conclusion: SCC展示了从CLIP建立对抗鲁棒范式的巨大潜力，对更广泛的视觉语言领域（如BioMedCLIP）具有重要影响。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual
question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning
to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive
framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable
medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region
extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language
models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific
framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while
maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5
diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured
explanations averaging 57 words with appropriate clinical terminology. Ablation
studies reveal that query reformulation provides the most significant initial
improvement, while chain-of-thought reasoning enables systematic diagnostic
processes. These findings underscore the potential of MedXplain-VQA as a
robust, explainable medical VQA system. Future work will focus on validation
with medical experts and large-scale clinical datasets to ensure clinical
readiness.

Motivation: 现有的音频驱动说话人脸生成方法在音频-唇部同步方面有所改进，但在时间一致性、身份保持和定制化方面存在困难，特别是在生成长视频时。

Method: 提出MAGIC-Talk框架，包含ReferenceNet（保持身份和文本提示的面部编辑）和AnimateNet（使用结构化运动先验增强运动连贯性），采用渐进潜在融合策略改善长视频质量。

Result: 大量实验表明，MAGIC-Talk在视觉质量、身份保持和同步准确性方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk为说话人脸生成提供了一个鲁棒的解决方案，能够从单张图像保持身份特征，同时确保帧间平滑过渡。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,

*Zahraa Al Sahili,Maryam Fetanat,Maimuna Nowaz,Ioannis Patras,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairJudge是一个轻量级评估协议，使用指令跟随的多模态LLM作为公平评判者来评估文本到图像系统的图像与提示匹配度和社会属性处理公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像系统评估方法（如面部分类器和对比相似度）存在不足：奖励表面线索、缺乏校准的弃权机制、无法评估弱可见属性（如宗教、文化、残疾）。需要更可靠、可复现的公平性评估方法。

Method: 将指令跟随的多模态LLM作为公平评判者，使用解释导向的评分标准（映射到[-1,1]），约束判断为封闭标签集，要求基于可见内容的证据，并在线索不足时强制弃权。

Result: 在FairFace、PaTA、FairCoT等数据集上评估性别、种族、年龄等属性，并扩展到宗教、文化和残疾。在IdenProf、FairCoT-Professions和新发布的DIVERSIFY-Professions上评估职业正确性和对齐度。评判模型在人口统计预测上优于对比和面部中心基线，提高了平均对齐度同时保持高职业准确性。

Conclusion: FairJudge协议能够实现更可靠、可复现的公平性审计，为文本到图像系统提供问责制强、基于证据的决策评估框架。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

*Aya Nakayama,Brian Wong,Yuji Nishimura,Kaito Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SP-CSVR框架解决LVLMs的"风格陷阱"问题，通过风格-内容解耦和语义对齐实现跨风格视觉推理的稳定性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型在多样视觉风格下语义理解不稳定的问题，特别是在上下文学习中，现有方法难以有效解耦风格与内容。

Method: 提出SP-CSVR框架，包含跨风格特征编码器(CSFE)用于风格-内容解耦、语义对齐上下文解码器(SAICD)用于少样本风格适应、自适应语义一致性模块(ASCM)通过多任务对比学习确保跨风格语义不变性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多风格数据集上的实验表明，SP-CSVR在视觉描述、视觉问答和上下文风格适应方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SP-CSVR通过增强鲁棒性、泛化性和效率，有效解决了跨多样视觉风格的语义理解挑战。

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual
styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to
effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address
this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR),
a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style
visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for
style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)
for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency
Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style
semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset
demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning,
visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive
evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm
SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency
across diverse visual styles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联合图像对齐方法需要长时间训练、大容量模型和大量超参数调优，计算复杂度高

Method: 利用现成图像匹配器计算成对匹配，通过快速非参数聚类构建图表示关键点关系，使用图神经网络传播对应关系，通过图像级池化预测单应性参数，采用逆组合损失函数

Result: 在多个基准测试中，FastJAM在几秒内完成对齐，比现有方法获得更好的对齐质量，计算时间从小时/分钟级降至秒级

Conclusion: FastJAM提供了一种快速有效的联合图像对齐解决方案，显著降低了计算复杂度，无需正则化项和超参数调优

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code
is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Semantic Surgery的训练无关、零样本概念擦除框架，直接在文本嵌入层面进行操作，通过向量减法中和目标概念的影响，在保持图像质量的同时实现高效概念擦除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型概念擦除方法往往损害生成质量，需要一种既能有效擦除有害内容又能保持图像质量的方法。

Method: 在扩散过程前直接操作文本嵌入，动态估计目标概念存在性并进行校准向量减法，包含共现编码模块和视觉反馈循环来处理多概念擦除和潜在概念持久性问题。

Result: 在物体、显式内容、艺术风格和多名人擦除任务中显著优于现有方法，达到93.58 H-score的物体擦除效果，将显式内容减少到仅1个实例，风格擦除H_a为8.09且无质量下降。

Conclusion: Semantic Surgery提供了一个实用的解决方案，既能作为内置威胁检测系统，又能确保更安全的文本到图像生成。

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于检索增强生成(RAG)和视觉语言模型(VLM)的零样本风电叶片损伤检测框架，无需任务特定训练，通过多模态知识库注入领域知识，在小样本数据集上实现100%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电叶片在恶劣环境中运行，需要及时检测损伤以防止故障。传统基于无人机和深度学习的方法依赖大量标注数据，难以检测罕见或新出现的损伤类型。

Method: 构建包含技术文档、参考图像和领域指南的多模态知识库，使用混合文本-图像检索器结合关键词重排序，为VLM提供相关上下文，无需任务特定训练。

Result: 在30张标记叶片图像上，RAG增强的VLM实现100%正确分类，优于无检索的VLM。框架在可解释性和泛化性方面表现突出，能够检测未见过的缺陷。

Conclusion: 该研究为工业检测提供了一种数据高效的解决方案，减少了对大量标注数据的依赖，通过领域知识而非仅依赖视觉线索实现损伤检测。

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in
livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to
manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the
risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a
comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected
across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons
and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm *
30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted
by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors
(AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual,
spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing
the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-LangSplat通过使用预训练的通用自动编码器替代场景特定的语言自动编码器，消除了3D语言场构建中的场景特定训练瓶颈，实现了高效且可扩展的开放词汇查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如LangSplat需要为每个场景训练特定的语言自动编码器进行特征压缩，这带来了昂贵的每场景优化瓶颈，限制了部署的可扩展性。

Method: 使用在ScanNet数据集上预训练的通用自动编码器，为任何新场景提供固定的紧凑潜在空间，无需场景特定训练。通过消融研究确定了最佳潜在嵌入维度。

Result: 整个语言场构建过程效率显著提升，查询性能与原LangSplat方法相当或更好，使用MSE和余弦相似度验证了表示保真度。

Conclusion: 通用嵌入能够高效准确地支持新3D场景中的开放词汇查询，为可扩展的实时交互3D AI应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种位置保持嵌入(PPE)方法，通过解耦编码3D位置信息来保持时空结构，在视觉令牌压缩中提高多模态大语言模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的令牌合并方法在减少序列长度时经常破坏空间布局和时间连续性，因为它们忽略了位置关系。

Method: PPE在令牌维度显式引入解耦的3D位置编码，使每个压缩令牌能够封装来自多个原始令牌的不同位置，并支持级联聚类策略。

Result: 在多个视觉语言基准测试中，包括MMBench、TextVQA和VideoMME，PPE实现了2%~5%的持续改进。

Conclusion: 保持位置线索对于高效有效的MLLM推理至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文通过训练双编码器网络测试生物特征统计不相关的假设，发现在指纹-指纹匹配、虹膜-虹膜匹配中个体生物特征存在相关性，但跨模态指纹-虹膜匹配效果仅略高于随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统认为个体生物特征统计不相关的假设，验证不同生物特征之间是否存在相关性。

Method: 使用ResNet-50和Vision Transformer作为双编码器架构，在274名受试者的约10万张指纹和7千张虹膜图像上训练，通过对比损失最小化同一受试者图像间的差异。

Result: 虹膜ResNet架构在虹膜-虹膜匹配中达到91% ROC AUC，证明左右虹膜相关；指纹模型重现了先前研究的正相关结果；跨模态匹配仅略高于随机水平。

Conclusion: 生物特征独立性假设受到挑战，未来需要更多数据和更复杂的流程来获得更有说服力的跨模态匹配结果。

Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are
statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder
networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint
matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching
using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:

Motivation: 现有基于码本的解决方案使用全局共享码本量化每个令牌，但忽略了图像内的类别特定相关性和令牌间的语义差异，导致在低比特率下性能不佳。

Method: 学习不同图像类别的码本组，为每个令牌分配独立码本，通过少量比特记录每个令牌所属的码本组，在降低每个码本组大小的同时减少损失。

Result: 在0.05 bpp下，重建图像在人脸识别数据集上达到93.51%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法可集成到任何现有的基于码本的表征学习方法中，在低比特率下显著提升了人脸图像的重建性能。

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

Conclusion: 该方法证明了通过融合现有专业模型可以高效实现统一多模态建模，作者将完整发布代码、模型权重和数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image
generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By
fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope
to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

Conclusion: FAME通过公平性感知的注意力调制有效缓解了视频编辑中的职业性别偏见问题，同时保持了良好的时间一致性和提示对齐。

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With
powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align
naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal
characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the
field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a
dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of
multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual
and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics
and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques
for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality

*Zhangkai Wu,Xuhui Fan,Zhongyuan Xie,Kaize Shi,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALA提出了一种变分对齐模块，通过自适应选择关键帧并将其潜在特征压缩为语义锚点，实现无需训练的、时序一致的视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式帧选择来保持DDIM反演中的时序一致性，这会引入人为偏差并降低端到端推理的可扩展性。

Method: VALA使用变分框架和对比学习目标，将跨帧潜在表示压缩为保持内容和时序一致性的潜在锚点。

Result: 在真实世界视频编辑基准测试中，VALA在反演保真度、编辑质量和时序一致性方面达到最先进性能，同时效率优于先前方法。

Conclusion: VALA可以完全集成到基于文本到图像的无训练视频编辑模型中，实现高效且一致的视频编辑。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing
quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over
prior methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的驾驶场景生成框架，联合生成高质量的语义占用、多视角视频和LiDAR点云，基于新构建的大规模Nuplan-Occ数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有占用中心方法对标注占用数据的依赖问题，这些数据仍然稀缺，限制了驾驶场景生成的性能和应用。

Method: 采用时空解耦架构支持4D动态占用的高保真空间扩展和时间预测；提出基于高斯溅射的稀疏点图渲染策略增强多视角视频生成；使用传感器感知嵌入策略显式建模LiDAR传感器特性。

Result: 在广泛实验中，该方法相比现有方法实现了更优的生成保真度和可扩展性，并在下游任务中验证了其实用价值。

Conclusion: 基于Nuplan-Occ数据集开发的统一框架能够有效克服占用数据稀缺的限制，为自动驾驶感知和规划评估提供高质量的合成场景。

Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoMP是一种前馈方法，通过多视图特征聚合和几何变换器预测3D物体的体积材料属性（杨氏模量、泊松比、密度），在精度和速度上远超现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理模拟依赖空间变化的力学属性，通常需要费力手动制作。VoMP旨在自动预测3D物体的体积材料属性，减少人工成本。

Method: 使用多视图特征聚合，通过训练的几何变换器预测每个体素的材料潜在编码，这些编码位于从真实世界数据集学习的物理可行材料流形上。提出结合分割3D数据集、材料数据库和视觉语言模型的标注流程。

Result: 实验表明VoMP能够准确估计体积属性，在精度和速度上大幅超越现有技术。

Conclusion: VoMP提供了一种有效的体积材料属性预测方法，通过学习的物理可行材料流形保证预测结果的有效性。

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often
laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict
Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在生成图像时难以保持概念一致性，特别是在场景层面。虽然已有工作关注角色一致性，但忽略了场景在故事讲述中的关键作用，限制了实际应用的创造力。

Method: 提出SceneDecorator框架，包含VLM引导的场景规划（确保不同场景间的叙事连贯性）和长时场景共享注意力机制（保持跨故事的长时场景一致性和主题多样性）。

Result: 大量实验证明SceneDecorator表现出优越性能，在艺术、电影和游戏领域具有释放创造力的潜力。

Conclusion: SceneDecorator通过解决场景规划和场景一致性两个关键挑战，为场景导向的故事生成提供了有效解决方案，能够显著提升生成故事的叙事质量和一致性。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they
still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images.
While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,
and games.

### [150] [LoMix: Learnable Weighted Multi-Scale Logits Mixing for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22995)
*Md Mostafijur Rahman,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoMix是一个可微分的即插即用模块，通过混合U型网络的多尺度解码器logits，自动学习最优的尺度融合方式和损失权重，在零推理开销下显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有U型网络训练方法要么只监督最终高分辨率logits，要么对所有尺度应用相同权重的深度监督，没有探索混合尺度的互补信息融合。

Method: 使用四种轻量级融合算子（加法、乘法、拼接、注意力加权融合）混合多尺度解码器logits，生成丰富的合成突变图，并通过softplus损失权重与网络参数共同优化。

Result: 在Synapse 8-organ数据集上，相比单输出监督DICE提升+4.2%，相比深度监督提升+2.2%，相比等权重加法融合提升+1.5%。在数据稀缺情况下优势更明显（+9.23%）。

Conclusion: LoMix证明了可学习的加权多尺度融合具有广泛的泛化能力，同时保持数据高效、完全可解释且推理无开销。

Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a
different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats
these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final,
highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss
weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations.
Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only
when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce
LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that
generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should
guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder
logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,
concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of
synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss
weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step
architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,
mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures
(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset
improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep
supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero
inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled
scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.
Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up
to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted
mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully
interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SLDGroup/LoMix.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMo是一个用于文本到视频生成的组合运动定制框架，能够在一个视频中合成多个不同的运动，解决了现有方法在组合场景中的运动-外观纠缠和无效多运动混合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频模型在生成多样化场景方面表现出色，但在精确运动控制方面存在困难，特别是在处理复杂多主体运动时。虽然已有单运动定制方法，但在组合场景中由于运动-外观纠缠和无效多运动混合而失败。

Method: CoMo采用两阶段方法：1）单运动学习阶段，通过静态-动态解耦调优范式将运动与外观分离，学习运动特定模块；2）多运动组合阶段，通过即插即用的分治策略，在去噪过程中空间隔离不同运动的影响，无需额外训练即可组合学习到的运动。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，CoMo实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了可控视频生成的能力。作者还引入了新的基准和评估指标来评估多运动保真度和混合效果。

Conclusion: CoMo框架通过解耦运动和外观、采用分治组合策略，成功解决了多运动定制问题，为可控视频生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video
generation. Our project page is at https://como6.github.io/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了统一的几何和属性增强框架UGAE，通过后几何增强、前属性增强和后属性增强三个核心组件，显著提升点云压缩的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云的有损压缩虽然降低了存储和传输成本，但不可避免地导致几何结构和属性信息的不可逆失真，需要解决这些质量问题。

Method: UGAE框架包含三个组件：PoGE使用基于Transformer的稀疏卷积U-Net重建几何结构；PAE采用增强几何引导的重新着色策略和细节感知KNN方法；PoAE使用属性残差预测网络和加权MSE损失。

Result: 在8iVFB、Owlii和MVUB三个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，相比G-PCC最新测试模型，几何方面获得9.98 dB BD-PSNR增益和90.98%比特率节省，属性方面获得3.67 dB BD-PSNR改进和56.88%比特率节省。

Conclusion: UGAE框架有效提升了点云压缩的几何和属性质量，同时显著改善了感知质量，在压缩效率和视觉质量方面都取得了显著进步。

Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
improved perceptual quality significantly.

TL;DR: 提出了M³T2IBench基准和AlignScore评估指标，用于评估文本到图像生成中多类别、多实例、多关系的图像-文本对齐，并提出了Revise-Then-Enforce方法来提升对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在生成与文本提示完美对齐的图像方面存在困难，现有评估方法要么过于简单，要么评估指标与人类评价相关性差，特别是忽视了同一类别下多个不同实例的复杂提示场景。

Method: 构建了大规模多类别、多实例、多关系基准M³T2IBench，开发了基于目标检测的AlignScore评估指标，并提出了无需训练的Revise-Then-Enforce后编辑方法来提升图像-文本对齐。

Result: 当前开源文本到图像模型在这个具有挑战性的基准上表现不佳，而提出的Revise-Then-Enforce方法在广泛的扩散模型中都能改善图像-文本对齐效果。

Conclusion: M³T2IBench基准和AlignScore指标能更好地评估复杂场景下的图像-文本对齐，Revise-Then-Enforce方法能有效提升生成图像与文本提示的对齐质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of
digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have
proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks
are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image
categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To
address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive
benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers
a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image,
image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer
three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型在图像生成中计算密集，且VAR等解决方案导致样本多样性有限，需要更高效的生成方法。

Method: 设计分层多尺度模块，采用嵌套自回归架构，其中较大尺度模块基于前一个较小尺度模块的输出；每个模块内部使用另一个AR结构生成token块；结合流匹配损失使用连续token；开发多尺度模块协调目标。

Result: NestAR在图像生成性能上具有竞争力，同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 嵌套自回归架构能有效降低计算复杂度并提高多样性，为高效图像生成提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

TL;DR: HieraMamba是一个用于视频时序定位的分层架构，通过Anchor-MambaPooling块和对比损失函数，在长视频中保持时间结构并实现精确的时间定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时往往通过过度下采样或依赖固定窗口来妥协时间保真度，无法同时捕捉全局上下文和细粒度时间细节。

Method: 使用分层架构和Anchor-MambaPooling块，利用Mamba的选择性扫描生成多粒度锚点标记，结合锚点条件和段池化对比损失来保持局部细节和全局区分性。

Result: 在Ego4D-NLQ、MAD和TACoS数据集上达到新的最先进水平，能够在长、未修剪视频中实现精确的时间定位。

Conclusion: HieraMamba通过分层设计和对比学习策略，有效解决了长视频时序定位中时间保真度与语义丰富度的平衡问题。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,
untrimmed videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜手术中，从视频进行准确的3D重建对下游任务和改善手术结果至关重要。但内窥镜场景存在光度不一致、非刚性组织运动和视角相关高光等独特挑战，仅依赖外观约束的3DGS方法往往不够充分。

Method: 1）采用统一的时空高斯表示，直接在4D域中优化基元；2）提出基于光流的几何约束来增强时间一致性并有效约束场景3D结构；3）提出多分辨率有理正交小波作为约束，有效分离内窥镜细节并提升渲染性能。

Result: 在两个真实手术数据集EndoNeRF和StereoMIS上的广泛评估表明，EndoWave相比基线方法实现了最先进的重建质量和视觉精度。

Conclusion: EndoWave通过结合几何约束和多分辨率小波监督，有效解决了内窥镜3D重建中的挑战，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and
frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key
guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and
plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods
consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with
significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal
understanding. Code will be avaliable at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了残差扩散桥模型(RDBM)，通过残差调制噪声注入和去除，在图像恢复任务中实现自适应修复退化区域同时保护完好区域，在多个任务上达到最先进性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散桥模型缺乏统一分析视角，且通过全局噪声注入和去除进行图像重建，会因不完美重建而扭曲未退化区域。

Method: 理论重构广义扩散桥的随机微分方程，推导其前向和反向过程的解析公式，利用给定分布的残差来调制噪声注入和去除过程。

Result: 在多样化图像恢复任务中，定性和定量实验均证明了方法的先进性能，且揭示了现有桥模型都是RDBM的特殊情况。

Conclusion: RDBM通过残差调制实现了自适应图像恢复，在保护完好区域的同时有效修复退化区域，为扩散桥模型提供了统一的理论框架。

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/RDBM.

TL;DR: 提出了一个任务无关的多模态融合框架，能够处理时间序列和单时间戳图像数据，支持跨模态生成并在下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态融合方法通常针对特定任务设计，缺乏通用性。本文旨在开发一个任务无关的框架，能够有效融合时间序列和图像数据，实现跨模态生成和鲁棒的下游性能。

Method: 采用确定性和学习策略进行时间序列量化，利用掩码相关学习目标在统一表示空间中对齐离散的图像和时间序列标记。在Earth observation领域实例化该模型。

Result: 预训练模型能够从卫星图像生成一致的全球温度剖面，并在下游任务中平均比任务特定融合方法在R²上提升6%，在RMSE上提升2%；比基线方法在R²上提升50%，在RMSE上提升12%。

Conclusion: 该任务无关预训练框架在多模态融合方面表现出优越性能，通过梯度敏感性分析提供了模型鲁棒性的见解，代码、数据和权重将开源发布。

Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and
single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream
performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for
time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning
objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified
representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the
pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from
satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across
downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific
fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods
by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity
across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Motivation: 土壤盐渍化严重威胁生态系统和农业生产力，实验室光谱分析精度高但难以扩展，卫星遥感覆盖范围广但分辨率不足，需要桥接这一差距。

Method: 提出DeepSalt框架，结合知识蒸馏策略和新型频谱适配单元，将实验室光谱的高分辨率洞察力迁移到卫星高光谱传感中。

Result: 在综合实证基准测试中，DeepSalt相比没有显式域适应的方法获得显著性能提升，能够有效泛化到未见过的地理区域，解释大部分盐分方差。

Conclusion: DeepSalt通过频谱迁移技术成功实现了无需大量地面采样的准确大规模土壤盐分估算，证明了所提频谱适配单元和知识蒸馏策略的有效性。

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

TL;DR: 本文从总最小二乘(TLS)线拟合角度统一了两种结构张量构造方法，证明Granlund和Knutsson 1995的修正项不必要，简化了张量解释并扩展了滤波器选择范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Bigun和Granlund 1987与Granlund和Knutsson 1995提出的两种看似不同的结构张量构造方法，寻求统一的理论框架。

Method: 通过总最小二乘(TLS)线拟合到功率谱的视角分析两种结构张量构造，比较梯度滤波器响应外积平均与正交滤波器调频向量加权外积两种方法。

Result: 两种方法在TLS框架下可统一，Granlund和Knutsson 1995的修正项可省略，确保张量保持半正定；扩展了滤波器选择范围，允许使用非正交滤波器和非角度镶嵌。

Conclusion: TLS视角为结构张量提供了统一的理论基础，简化了张量构造，增强了方法灵活性，支持多方向拟合和更广泛的滤波器选择。

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，一些参考点距离目标物体较远，容易导致误检。需要确保参考点从物体表面或内部采样，提高检测准确性。

Method: 1. 深度引导查询生成器：利用深度信息和2D检测结果生成参考点；2. 混合注意力机制：融合历史检测结果与深度引导查询，形成混合查询。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，mAP提升6.3%，NDS提升4.3%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DQ3D方法通过深度引导和混合注意力机制，有效解决了参考点采样问题，提升了3D物体检测性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

Motivation: 现有的可迁移性估计方法难以准确评估具有多样化架构、训练策略和任务对齐的新兴预训练模型，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: 使用隐式可迁移性建模框架，结合分治变分近似策略来高效近似嵌入空间的演化过程。

Result: 在涵盖广泛训练机制和模型类型的综合基准测试中，ITM在稳定性、有效性和效率方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ITM框架能够更准确地估计预训练模型的可迁移性，促进预训练-微调范式的应用和发展。

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应门控融合(AG-Fusion)方法，通过识别可靠模式来选择性整合跨模态知识，用于复杂场景中的鲁棒3D目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态相机-LiDAR融合方法在传感器退化或环境干扰等挑战性场景中性能显著下降，需要更鲁棒的融合策略。

Method: 首先将各模态特征投影到统一的BEV空间并使用基于窗口的注意力机制增强，然后设计基于跨模态注意力的自适应门控融合模块来整合特征。

Result: 在标准KITTI数据集上达到93.92%的准确率，在新建的E3D数据集上比基线方法提升24.88%，在复杂工业场景中表现出对不可靠模态信息的优越鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AG-Fusion方法能够有效处理传感器退化等挑战性场景，在复杂工业环境中实现了鲁棒的多模态3D目标检测。

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D
dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in
complex industrial scenes.

Motivation: 现有3D场景类比方法需要额外训练和固定对象词汇，限制了在未见环境中的适应性和规划能力。

Result: 方法能够在复杂场景间建立准确的对应关系，成功应用于轨迹和路径点转移任务。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了零样本、开放词汇的3D场景类比，为机器人演示迁移和任务规划提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

Motivation: 摄像头产生的海量视频数据远超人类监控能力，需要自动检测异常或犯罪事件以保障公共安全。智能体识别意外事件的能力与其空间推理能力密切相关。

Method: 将异常行为识别构建为零样本、语言基础的任务，通过将视频转换为文本描述，使用文本蕴含对标签进行评分，评估预训练视觉-LLM作为空间基础零样本异常检测器的能力。

Result: 少量样本示例可以提高某些模型的准确性，但可能增加误报；隐私过滤器（特别是全身GAN变换）会引入不一致性降低准确性。模型在简单、空间显著事件上表现良好，但在噪声空间线索和身份模糊时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 提出了无需任务特定训练即可增强空间基础的具体路径：结构感知提示、跨片段的轻量级空间记忆、描述过程中的场景图或3D姿态先验，以及保留动作相关几何的隐私方法。

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecoDINO是一个改进的顶点级接触预测模型，基于DECO框架构建，使用双DINOv2编码器和补丁级交叉注意力，在DAMON基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DECO模型在软表面、遮挡、儿童和假阳性脚部接触方面的局限性，提高人类与物体接触预测的准确性。

Method: 采用三分支网络架构，使用两个DINOv2 ViT-g/14编码器，结合类别平衡损失权重和补丁级交叉注意力，最后通过轻量级MLP和softmax分配语义接触标签。

Result: 在DAMON基准测试中：二进制接触F1分数提升7%，测地误差减半，并增加了对象级语义标签预测；在DAMON挑战赛的两个任务中都优于基线。

Conclusion: DecoDINO通过LoRA微调和双编码器架构显著提升了接触预测性能，简化架构比集成视觉语言模型效果更好。

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding
objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models
used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the
wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and
struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot
contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch
network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,
class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention
for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a
lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also
tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the
simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON
benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii)
halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level
semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual
encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge
baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at

Result: VR-Drive有效减轻了合成引起的噪声，并改善了视角变化下的规划性能。

Conclusion: VR-Drive是端到端自动驾驶系统在现实世界部署中可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: PathSearch是一个可扩展且通用的数字病理学检索解决方案，能有效支持临床诊断工作流程。

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable
retrieval solution for digital pathology.

Method: 收集了12,832个视频（35.64小时）的数据集，涵盖多个公开数据集，并在不同屏幕、智能手机、光照条件和相机角度下拍摄。还使用DeepMoiréFake数据集和两种合成莫尔生成技术进行额外实验。

Result: 莫尔伪影使检测器性能下降高达25.4%，合成生成的莫尔模式导致准确率下降21.4%。去莫尔方法不仅没有缓解问题，反而使准确率进一步降低17.2%。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发能够稳健处理莫尔失真以及其他现实挑战（如压缩、锐化和模糊）的检测模型，DMF数据集的引入旨在推动研究缩小受控实验与实际深度伪造检测之间的差距。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出Eruku方法，将手写文本生成重新定义为多模态提示条件生成任务，通过引入特殊文本标记和改进的自回归模型，解决了内容可控性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归Transformer方法在手写文本生成中需要额外输入、缺乏停止机制、容易出现重复循环和视觉伪影，需要改进内容可控性。

Method: 将HTG构建为多模态提示条件生成任务，引入特殊文本输入标记以更好地与视觉标记对齐，并设计基于Classifier-Free-Guidance的自回归模型策略。

Result: 相比先前解决方案，Eruku方法需要更少输入，对未见风格泛化能力更好，更忠实地遵循文本提示，提高了内容遵循度。

Conclusion: Eruku方法通过重新思考自回归公式，有效解决了手写文本生成中的内容可控性问题，在风格保真度和内容遵循方面表现优异。

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

TL;DR: 提出渐进式补丁大小增长方法，通过训练过程中逐步增加补丁大小来改善3D医学图像分割性能，在资源高效模式下减少44%训练时间，在性能模式下提升1.28% Dice分数。


<details>

Motivation: 解决传统恒定补丁大小采样在3D医学图像分割中存在的类别不平衡问题，并加速训练收敛过程。

Method: 渐进式补丁大小增长策略，在模型训练过程中逐步增加输入补丁的大小，包括资源高效模式和性能模式两种设置。

Result: 在15个不同的3D医学图像分割任务中，资源高效模式将训练时间减少到44%同时保持相同性能；性能模式相对基准提升1.28% Dice分数，训练时间减少到89%。

Conclusion: 这种简单而优雅的输入数据变换策略显著提升了Dice分数性能和训练效率，且适用于多种分割架构如UNet、UNETR和SwinUNETR。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对视觉语言模型的依赖增加，需要评估多模态模型的复杂性和方向正确性，特别是关注文本主导问题和模态间交互的探索不足。

Method: 使用基于Shapley值的特征归因和模态评分方法，将视频帧和文本元素视为平等特征，将多选VQA任务视为视频、问题和答案三个模态的交互。

Result: 结果显示模型对文本的依赖性强，多选VQA任务实际上变成了模型忽略干扰项的能力测试。

Conclusion: 当前VLM模型在多选VQA任务中存在文本主导问题，任务复杂度可能被高估，需要更平衡的模态交互评估方法。

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

Motivation: 现实世界物体具有自然层次结构，传统CNN平面分类方法忽略了这种层次关系，无法利用对象间关系提升分类性能和控制错误严重程度

Method: 基于YOLO模型构建端到端层次化模型，设计新颖层次化架构、改进损失函数和专用层次化性能评估指标

Result: 在两种不同层次化分类体系（系统分类和视觉特征分类）上训练评估，结果表明该方法能有效处理现实世界物体的层次结构

Conclusion: 所提方法成功解决了传统平面分类算法忽视的层次结构问题，通过利用对象间关系提升了分类性能

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

TL;DR: AdaSDE是一种新颖的单步SDE求解器，通过动态调节误差校正强度来统一ODE的效率和SDE的误差鲁棒性，在有限步数下实现最先进的扩散采样性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ODE和SDE求解器在扩散生成过程中存在互补弱点：ODE求解器沿确定性轨迹积累不可约梯度误差，而SDE方法在步数有限时遭受放大的离散化误差。

Method: 引入AdaSDE，一种单步SDE求解器，通过轻量级蒸馏估计每个步长的可学习系数，动态调节误差校正强度来加速扩散采样。该框架可与现有求解器集成。

Result: 在5NFE下，AdaSDE在CIFAR-10上达到4.18的FID分数，在FFHQ上达到8.05，在LSUN Bedroom上达到6.96，表现最先进。

Conclusion: AdaSDE成功统一了ODE的效率和SDE的误差鲁棒性，为扩散采样提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available

*Yingying Feng,Jie Li,Jie Hu,Yukang Zhang,Lei Tan,Jiayi Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDReID是一个灵活的任意模态到任意模态的图像级重识别框架，通过解耦模态共享特征和模态特定特征，在模态匹配和不匹配场景下都能有效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的重识别系统经常面临模态不一致问题（如RGB、NIR、TIR等不同传感器），而现有方法大多假设模态匹配条件，限制了在实际应用中的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出MDReID框架，包含两个关键组件：模态解耦学习（MDL）将模态特征显式分解为模态共享和模态特定表示；模态感知度量学习（MML）通过强制两个分量的正交性和互补性来增强跨模态判别能力。

Result: 在三个多模态重识别基准测试（RGBNT201、RGBNT100、MSVR310）上的实验表明，MDReID在模态匹配场景下分别获得9.8%、3.0%、11.5%的mAP提升，在模态不匹配场景下分别获得3.4%、11.8%、10.9%的平均增益。

Conclusion: MDReID通过模态特征解耦和专门的度量学习策略，有效解决了多模态重识别中的模态不一致问题，在模态匹配和不匹配场景下都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有多视图3D重建方法严重依赖输入视图之间的充分重叠，实践中遮挡和稀疏覆盖经常导致严重的不完整重建。基于扩散的3D生成技术虽然可以通过学习生成先验来补全不可见部分，但其随机性限制了生成结果的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReconViaGen，创新性地将重建先验整合到生成框架中，设计了多个策略来解决：(a) 提取多视图图像特征作为条件时构建和利用跨视图连接的不足；(b) 局部细节生成过程中迭代去噪的差可控性导致与输入不一致的几何和纹理细节。

Result: 大量实验证明，ReconViaGen能够在全局结构和局部细节上重建与输入视图一致的完整且准确的3D模型。

Conclusion: ReconViaGen成功解决了基于扩散的3D生成方法在多视图重建中的一致性问题，实现了高质量的三维重建效果。

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

Abstract: This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis:
the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the
need for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By
focusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain
adaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations,
presenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep
learning in medical imaging.
  Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative
neural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain
adaptation. This model is adept at pre-training on diverse medical image
datasets, handling varying sizes and modalities, and is equipped with a dynamic
input-output adaptation mechanism. This enables efficient processing and
integration of a wide range of medical image types, from 2D X-rays to complex
3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.
  Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in
medical imaging. It introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of
extracting meaningful information from unlabeled data, significantly advancing
the model's interpretative abilities. This approach is validated through
rigorous experimentation, including the use of the MedMNIST dataset,
demonstrating the model's proficiency in learning generalized features
applicable to various downstream tasks.
  In summary, this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image
analysis by offering a scalable, adaptable framework that reduces reliance on
labeled data. It paves the way for more accurate, efficient diagnostic tools in
healthcare, signifying a major step forward in the application of deep learning

improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with
trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we
further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance

Motivation: 平面跟踪在机器人和增强现实中具有重要作用，但在深度学习时代缺乏大规模平台限制了其发展。现有基准数据集在目标多样性方面存在不足。

Method: 构建了包含1,000个短期和150个长期视频的大规模数据集，所有视频在无约束条件下录制，每个视频帧通过四角点手动标注并经过多轮精细检查和优化，每个序列只包含一个独特目标以增强目标多样性。

Result: PlanarTrack是目前最大、最多样化且最具挑战性的平面跟踪数据集。评估了10个代表性平面跟踪器，发现顶级跟踪器在PlanarTrack上性能显著下降，表明需要更多努力来改进平面跟踪。

Conclusion: PlanarTrack为平面跟踪研究提供了重要的基准平台，揭示了当前方法的局限性，将促进该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at

Result: LSSR显著改善了作物边界描绘和恢复，在RGB和IR通道上分别达到PSNR/SSIM为32.63/0.84和23.99/0.78，NDVI均方误差最低为0.042，推理速度为0.39秒/图像。在HLS超分辨率任务中，作物分类F1得分达到0.86。

Conclusion: LSSR展示了遥感超分辨率在推进精准农业方面的潜力，提供了一种高效且科学可靠的重建方法。

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the
challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.
(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond
the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground
samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and
indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference
among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with
reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,
we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict
query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to
identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing
ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess
the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that
dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the
training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer
preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples
and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data
counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at
https://github.com/ldong1111/VideoTG-R1.

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural
networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate
that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such
as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning
capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision
transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts
DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information
from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms.
It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of
downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while
generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show
that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining
strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and
multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI
modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces
dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a
scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant
potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市环境中点云配准面临的密度差异、噪声特性和遮挡场景等复杂挑战，提升移动激光扫描数据在动态城市监测中的实用性。

Method: 1) SSC预处理技术：通过识别相互正交的平面表面来优化分割MLS轨迹数据；2) PV-GICP精细配准方法：在体素分区内选择性利用平面表面进行配准。

Result: 在慕尼黑内城真实数据集上实现了平均亚0.01米的配准精度，计算时间比传统点对平面ICP方法减少50%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法能够推进自动化3D城市建模和更新，在城市规划、基础设施管理和动态城市监测中具有直接应用价值。

Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
city monitoring.

Result: 能够重建详细且可编辑的CAD模型，在性能上超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了草图约束的直接整合，为CAD逆向工程提供了更有效和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the
reconstruction process.

Result: 在脑肿瘤数据集上准确率达96.60%，数字膝关节X射线数据集75.60%，Mini-DDSM数据集93.35%（基于ResNet-50）；基于DenseNet-121分别达到95.77%、80.36%和93.22%，均优于其他训练策略。

Conclusion: CURVETE模型通过课程学习和渐进式自监督训练有效提升了医学图像分类性能，特别是在样本有限和类别分布不均衡的情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a
notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques,
leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However,
the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular
distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional
neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised
Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples,
enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification
performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based
on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic
unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class
distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream
task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image
datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We
investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised
sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning
component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that
the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy
of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray
dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50.
Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%,
80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM
datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对低光条件建模不完整，影响下游任务性能。通过重新审视低光图像形成过程，扩展经典Lambertian模型来更好表征低光条件。

Method: 在频域分析中证明频域通道比可用于提取光照不变特征，提出FRBNet模块，集成频域通道比操作与可学习频域滤波器。

Conclusion: FRBNet作为即插即用模块，无需修改损失函数即可集成到现有网络中，有效提升低光视觉任务性能。

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
+2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:

Method: 构建Video-Thinker-10K数据集，采用监督微调学习推理格式，然后通过组相对策略优化强化推理能力，使MLLMs能够自主执行定位和描述任务。

Result: Video-Thinker在领域内任务和具有挑战性的领域外视频推理基准测试中都取得了显著的性能提升，Video-Thinker-7B在7B规模的MLLMs中建立了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Video-Thinker使MLLMs能够在视频推理中自主导航定位和描述任务，无需构建和调用外部工具，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协同感知数据集通常局限于单个交叉路口或单一车辆，缺乏多车辆和多基础设施传感器在多个交叉路口的综合数据集，导致算法在多样化交通环境中的基准测试受限，容易出现过拟合和误导性高性能问题。

Method: 在德国英戈尔施塔特三个城市交叉路口部署了车辆和基础设施传感器，收集了34个时间对齐和空间校准的传感器序列，每个序列持续20秒，涉及两辆车和最多三个基础设施传感器杆，所有序列以10Hz频率标注13个对象类别的3D边界框。

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：监督微调需要大量人工标注且无法捕捉细微偏好，强化学习有开销和不稳定性问题。需要解决可扩展性、鲁棒性和对齐质量之间的权衡。

Method: 1. 通过token合并进行注意力感知的图像混合，增强聚类表示和空间上下文；2. 构建混合图像与原始图像的偏好对；3. 使用SimPO损失进行优化。

Result: MergeMix在分类任务中超越其他基于启发式的方法，实现了具有竞争力的准确率和改进的效率。

Conclusion: MergeMix为分类和多模态大语言模型中的偏好对齐提供了一种可扩展的方法，增强了注意力一致性和效率。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
(RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations
and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文发现大型视觉语言模型生成的视觉-文本多模态思维链缺乏忠实性，视觉信息往往不准确但答案正确。作者提出SCCM学习策略来提升视觉信息的可靠性和充分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在强化微调后生成的视觉-文本多模态思维链中，视觉信息往往不准确但答案仍然正确，表明推理过程缺乏忠实性。这源于RL奖励只鼓励视觉-文本交替格式，而不考虑视觉信息的正确性。

Method: 提出SCCM（充分成分因果模型）学习策略，鼓励生成充分且最小的视觉成分，这些成分能够独立导致正确答案。该方法无需标注，可与各种RFT方法即插即用。

Result: 实证结果表明，SCCM在一系列细粒度感知和推理基准测试中持续提升了视觉忠实性。

Conclusion: SCCM方法有效解决了多模态思维链中视觉信息不可靠和不充分的问题，显著提升了推理过程的忠实性。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is
available at https://github.com/EugeneLiu01/Faithful_Thinking_with_Image.

Conclusion: 混合方法平衡学习先验与物理约束，是实现生产级体积视频重光照的实用步骤

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances
into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally
stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition
methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and
instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain
constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that
combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and
physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic
estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading
components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such
as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity
Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real
and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially
more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while
scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results
indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically
grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric
video relighting.

Conclusion: VOLD框架成功实现了从文本教师模型到视觉语言学生的推理能力迁移，冷启动对齐是通过SFT实现有效在线蒸馏的关键因素。

Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a
challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning
data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

Result: 在多种医学图像数据集上的实验表明，iPac相比基线方法平均准确率提升达5%。

Conclusion: iPac为图像分类，特别是医学图像分类，提供了一种通用解决方案，通过图表示有效利用了视觉实体间的内在结构和关系。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image
processing, yet their performance in image classification tasks is hindered by
a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among
visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new
graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image
classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and
relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages,
including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph
construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph
neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and
organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation
that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental
evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac,
exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.
Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,
particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph
representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships
among visual entities.

TL;DR: FreeFuse是一种无需训练的多主体文本到图像生成方法，通过自动融合多个主题LoRA实现，利用交叉注意力层权重自动生成动态主体掩码


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么专注于预推理阶段的LoRA权重合并，要么依赖分割模型和复杂技术来隔离LoRA输出，需要更实用高效的解决方案

Method: 通过交叉注意力层权重自动推导上下文感知的动态主体掩码，在推理过程中直接将这些掩码应用于LoRA输出

Result: FreeFuse在多主体生成任务中在生成质量和可用性方面均优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练、无需修改LoRA、无需辅助模型、无需用户定义提示模板或区域规范，具有出色的实用性和效率

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

Motivation: 自我中心视频推理需要推断隐藏意图和识别细粒度交互，这是当前多模态大语言模型所缺乏的具身、第一人称理解能力。

Method: 1) 构建EgoRe-5M大规模自我中心问答数据集；2) 使用监督微调教授推理技能；3) 通过强化微调增强时空定位能力。

Result: EgoThinker在多个自我中心基准测试中优于现有方法，在细粒度时空定位任务上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该框架成功提升了多模态大语言模型在自我中心推理方面的能力，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera
who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden
intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge
limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible
event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust
egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought
supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M,
a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric
video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with
detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT
on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning
RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show
that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric
benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained
spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式深度估计方法在训练时会导致预训练模型的图像生成能力严重退化，需要一种既能扩展深度估计功能又不损害原始生成能力的方法。

Method: 引入可插拔框架，通过简单转换器在图像生成和深度估计模式间切换；提出组重用机制促进参数重用，提高额外可学习参数的利用率。

Result: 在多个深度估计基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时成功保持了预训练模型的原始图像生成能力。

Conclusion: 预训练文本到图像模型不仅能生成图像，还能轻松扩展到深度估计任务，MERGE框架有效释放了这种潜力而不损害原有功能。

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a
play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image
generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters.
Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and
improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes
the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other
unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The

TL;DR: 提出Lookahead Anchoring方法，利用未来时间步的关键帧作为方向性锚点，解决音频驱动人体动画中身份漂移问题，无需额外关键帧生成阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动人体动画模型在时间自回归生成过程中容易出现身份漂移问题，现有方法需要额外关键帧生成且限制自然运动动态。

Method: 使用未来时间步的关键帧作为前瞻锚点，模型在响应即时音频线索的同时持续追求这些未来锚点，实现身份一致性保持。支持自关键帧化，参考图像直接作为前瞻目标。

Result: 应用于三个近期人体动画模型，在唇部同步、身份保持和视觉质量方面表现优越，时间距离参数自然控制表达性与一致性平衡。

Conclusion: Lookahead Anchoring方法有效改善时间条件化，在不同架构上均能提升动画质量，无需额外关键帧生成。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续自回归模型在视觉像素数据上遇到的序列过长和高维空间问题，实现直接对原始像素分布进行显式建模。

Method: 使用可逆自回归流将图像转换为潜在序列，通过自监督维度减少方案分离信息性和冗余性通道，并设计一步蒸馏方案加速推理。

Result: 在像素级生成模型中达到竞争性性能，同时提供精确似然估计和可扩展训练。

Conclusion: FARMER成功统一了归一化流和自回归模型，为直接像素级生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数3D算法假设相机内参在视频中保持不变，但实际视频中内参经常变化。现有基准缺乏动态相机内参的标注，限制了相关研究的发展。

Method: 构建了全面的校准实验查找表，扩展了Kalibr工具箱以提高准确性和鲁棒性，创建了包含室内外视频的基准数据集。

Result: 评估现有基线方法发现，大多数方法在动态内参视频上难以实现准确预测，凸显了新基准的必要性。

Conclusion: InFlux基准填补了动态相机内参研究领域的空白，为开发更鲁棒的相机内参预测方法提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

TL;DR: PRISM-Bench是一个基于视觉谜题的基准测试，通过要求模型识别思维链中的第一个错误步骤，来评估多模态大语言模型的推理一致性和错误检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法只关注最终答案准确性，无法评估模型的推理过程质量。需要一种能够诊断模型推理一致性和错误检测能力的评估方法。

Method: 设计包含视觉谜题和带有一个错误的思维链的诊断任务，要求模型识别第一个错误步骤。谜题需要多步符号、几何和类比推理，避免表面模式匹配。

Result: 评估显示最先进的多模态大语言模型在流畅生成和忠实推理之间存在差距：能产生合理思维链的模型往往无法定位简单的逻辑错误。

Conclusion: PRISM-Bench通过分离答案生成和推理验证，为多模态推理能力提供了更精确的评估，强调了在开发可信赖多模态大语言模型时需要诊断性评估协议。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual
challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but
how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only
final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual
puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error,
models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables
fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual
reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric,
and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern
matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap
between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible
CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer
generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on
multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic
evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有MLLM主要关注整体场景级理解，忽视了细粒度的对象中心推理需求。

Conclusion: PixelRefer框架成功解决了细粒度对象中心理解问题，其轻量级变体在效率和精度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D/4D生成方法在保持跨视角语义身份一致性方面存在不足，个性化3D/4D生成研究仍不充分。

Method: 采用Track-Inpaint-REsplat三阶段方法：视频跟踪识别需修改区域，主题驱动2D修复逐步填充，重新拼接保持3D一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，相比最先进方法，该方法在3D/4D生成中的身份保持能力显著提升。

Conclusion: TIRE方法为个性化3D/4D生成提供了有效解决方案，在身份保持方面表现优异。

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

Motivation: 受人类通过多感官协同学习抽象概念的启发，希望开发能够从单一模态回忆已形成概念表示的模型。

Method: 结合3D模态内自蒸馏和2D-3D跨模态联合嵌入，通过零样本可视化展示学习到的空间特征。

Result: 在线性探测3D场景感知任务中，分别比最先进的2D和3D自监督模型提升14.2%和4.8%；在ScanNet上达到80.7% mIoU的新SOTA结果；还能线性投影到CLIP语言空间实现开放世界感知。

Conclusion: Concerto能够产生具有优越细粒度几何和语义一致性的空间表示，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频会议依赖高速网络，当网络不佳时用户只能使用音频通信，这对依赖手势、身体动作和面部表情的美国手语用户造成严重不便。

Method: 通过音频编码和传输人体姿势信息，利用人类姿势数据的结构约束设计接收端错误检测和校正机制，在模拟网络退化环境中生成姿势基ASL视频序列。

Result: 实验结果表明，在视频传输受损的低带宽场景下，VC4ASL能有效实现可理解的手语通信。

Conclusion: VC4ASL系统成功解决了低带宽环境下手语用户的通信障碍，为视频会议应用提供了包容性解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, video conferencing applications have become increasingly
prevalent, relying heavily on high-speed internet connectivity. When such
connectivity is lacking, users often default to audio-only communication, a
mode that significantly disadvantages American Sign Language (ASL) users, whose
communication relies on hand gestures, body movement, and facial expressions.
In this work, we introduce VC4ASL, a system designed to enable ASL
communication over the audio channel of existing video conferencing
applications, even in the absence of reliable video. VC4ASL integrates
seamlessly with current platforms without requiring any modifications. Our
approach establishes a communication channel through audio by encoding and
transmitting human pose information, which is then rendered to reconstruct
signed content. We propose novel receive-side error detection and correction
mechanisms that exploit the inherent structural constraints of human pose data.
To evaluate the system, we simulate network-degraded environments, generate
pose-based ASL video sequences, and conduct user studies to assess
comprehension among ASL users. Experimental results demonstrate that VC4ASL
effectively facilitates intelligible ASL communication over audio in
low-bandwidth scenarios where video transmission is impaired.

Traditional monitoring approaches fail to bridge the gap between technical
infrastructure metrics and business process visibility. We introduce a novel
feature engineering approach based on processing times computed between
consecutive ISO 20022 message exchanges, creating a compact representation of
system state. By applying anomaly detection to these features, we enable early
failure detection and localization, allowing incident classification.
Experimental evaluation on the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system,
using both real-world incidents and controlled simulations, demonstrates the
approach's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides
inherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the
business impact. By mapping features to distinct processing phases, the
resulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system
issues, significantly reduces investigation time, and bridges observability
gaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across
multiple entities.

### [213] [Numerical Fragility in Transformers: A Layer-wise Theory for Explaining, Forecasting, and Mitigating Instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21770)
*Jinwoo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个模块化的一阶理论来预测Transformer在低精度训练中的前向误差放大问题，推导了自注意力层的稳定性边界，并开发了可操作的诊断指标来预测和缓解不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低精度训练的Transformer存在前向误差放大的问题，需要理论分析和实用诊断工具来理解和缓解这一问题。

Method: 建立模块化的一阶理论，推导自注意力层的稳定性边界，引入三个可解释的诊断指标：分数尺度比、行向softmax敏感度和值矩阵条件数，以及LayerNorm指标。

Result: 在Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10上的实验表明，组合预测器能准确跟踪FP32与低精度之间的不匹配，时间序列最大值可作为早期预警信号，基于LayerNorm指标的微调能稳定训练。

Conclusion: 该理论提供了可操作的无量纲诊断工具，能够解释自注意力的脆弱性、预测不稳定性，并指导最小侵入性的缓解措施。

Abstract: Transformers trained in low precision can suffer forward-error amplification.
We give a first-order, module-wise theory that predicts when and where errors
grow. For self-attention we derive a per-layer bound that factorizes into three
interpretable diagnostics: a score-scale ratio $\kappa_{\rm score}$, a rowwise
softmax sensitivity $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$, and value conditioning $\kappa(V)$.
We prove a residual relaxation inequality showing that residual blocks
attenuate depth-wise accumulation, and we introduce a precision- and
width-aware LayerNorm indicator $\rho_{\rm LN}$ with a matching first-order
bound in the $\epsilon$-dominated regime. These pieces yield a unified
forward-stability bound whose right-hand side is directly estimable during
training.
  On Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10 we evaluate the bound and components. (1) The combined
predictor $\kappa_{\rm softmax},(1+\kappa_{\rm
score}),\kappa(V),|W_O|2+\kappa{\rm eff}+C_{\rm LN}$ tracks
FP32$\leftrightarrow$LP mismatches across seeds, widths, and precisions;
scaling by $\epsilon_{\rm mach}$ collapses mixed-precision points. (2) The
time-series maximum of $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$ acts as an early-warning signal,
leading error spikes by 16-24 steps (corr. 0.65-0.82; permutation
$p!\approx!10^{-3}$; Precision@K 0.89-1.00). (3) Guided by $\rho_{\rm LN}$, a
small LayerNorm-$\epsilon$ tweak targeting $\rho_\star$ gives consistent
stabilization (mean tail-loss $\downarrow\ \approx0.010$ at $\rho_\star!=!0.6$,
cap$=10^{-2}$) with negligible overhead.
  Overall, our theory supplies actionable, unitless diagnostics that (i)
explain when self-attention is fragile, (ii) forecast instability, and (iii)
motivate a minimally invasive mitigation.

*Jinwoo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)方法，通过直接优化层谱来改善神经网络训练条件，显著降低条件数并提升测试精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决神经网络训练中条件数过大的问题，导致梯度消失和训练不稳定，需要直接控制层谱来改善优化过程。

Method: 使用Chebyshev矩正则化，联合控制谱边界（通过对数条件代理）和内部形状（通过Chebyshev矩），采用解耦的带帽混合规则来保持任务梯度。

Result: 在对抗性κ-stress设置中，CMR将平均层条件数从约3900降低到约3.4（减少约10^3倍），增加平均梯度幅度，并将测试精度从约10%提升到约86%。

Conclusion: 支持优化驱动的谱预处理方法，直接引导模型进入良好条件状态，实现稳定准确的学习。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)}, a simple,
architecture-agnostic loss that directly optimizes layer spectra. CMR jointly
controls spectral edges via a log-condition proxy and shapes the interior via
Chebyshev moments, with a decoupled, capped mixing rule that preserves task
gradients. We prove strictly monotone descent for the condition proxy, bounded
moment gradients, and orthogonal invariance. In an adversarial
``$\kappa$-stress'' setting (MNIST, 15-layer MLP), \emph{compared to vanilla
training}, CMR reduces mean layer condition numbers by $\sim\!10^3$ (from
$\approx3.9\!\times\!10^3$ to $\approx3.4$ in 5 epochs), increases average
gradient magnitude, and restores test accuracy (
$\approx10\%\!\to\!\approx86\%$ ). These results support
\textbf{optimization-driven spectral preconditioning}: directly steering models
toward well-conditioned regimes for stable, accurate learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发机器学习模型预测术后误吸风险，发现阿片类药物剂量和手术部位是重要影响因素，存在性别差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误吸严重影响手术患者发病率和死亡率，需要开发预测模型以实现及时预防干预。

Method: 从MIMIC-IV数据库中识别826例术后误吸患者和匹配对照组，使用XGBoost、多层感知机和随机森林三种机器学习模型进行预测，并采用增强逆概率加权估计平均治疗效果。

Result: 机器学习模型在测试集上AUROC达到0.86，敏感性77.3%。最大日阿片类药物剂量、住院时间和患者年龄是最重要预测因子。男性误吸风险是女性的1.5倍，且阿片类药物剂量高出27%。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能有效预测术后误吸风险，阿片类药物剂量和手术部位显著影响风险，性别差异值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Background: Aspiration, the inhalation of foreign material into the lungs,
significantly impacts surgical patient morbidity and mortality. This study
develops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration,
enabling timely preventative interventions.
  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we
identified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\% male) who experienced
aspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspiration
cohort. Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were
trained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative
aspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects
(ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.
  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\% sensitivity on a
held-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age
emerged as the most important predictors. ATE analysis identified significant
causative factors: opioids (0.25 +/- 0.06) and operative site (neck: 0.20 +/-
0.13, head: 0.19 +/- 0.13). Despite equal surgery rates across genders, men
were 1.5 times more likely to aspirate and received 27\% higher maximum daily
opioid dosages compared to women.
  Conclusion: ML models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk,
enabling targeted preventative measures. Maximum daily opioid dosage and
operative site significantly influence aspiration risk. The gender disparity in
both opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation.
These findings have important implications for improving postoperative care
protocols and aspiration prevention strategies.

Motivation: 解决在上下文环境中如何最优聚合专家委员会输出以获得最佳准确率的问题，特别是在在线学习场景下动态调整专家权重。

Method: 1. 结合聚合投票与UCB驱动的连续消除算法，高效剪枝次优探索动作；2. 使用在线加权多数投票机制，根据各专家的预测能力按比例分配投票权重。

Result: 在理想情况下推导了bandit设置中的遗憾理论保证，并提供了相应的实证结果。应用于大语言模型在线微调，动态重新加权专家集和/或选择最优专家委员会。

Conclusion: 提出了结合多个专家以提升整体聚合模型性能的新方法和无遗憾保证。

Abstract: We explore the use of expert-guided bandit learning, which we refer to as
online mixture-of-experts (OMoE). In this setting, given a context, a candidate
committee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve
optimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to
address this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with
UCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration
actions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting
mechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional
to their predictive power. We derive theoretical guarantees for the regret
properties in the bandit setting under ideal circumstances, and empirical
results are provided accordingly. As a modern study on applications, these
methods are applied to the online fine-tuning of a set of expert large language
models (LLMs), where after each response, the generative LLM dynamically
reweighs its set of experts and/or selects the optimal committee of experts to
generate the most accurate response. Our results introduce new methodologies
and no-regret guarantees for combining multiple experts to improve on the
performance of the an aggregate model overall.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种称为方差减少引导（VRG）的新方法，通过统计测量预测误差并寻找新的采样轨迹来提升扩散模型的生成质量，无需模型微调或修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中存在预测误差，这些误差会累积并降低生成质量，需要一种方法来缓解这种误差。

Method: VRG方法统计测量预测误差，在预定义采样轨迹的基础上寻找新的轨迹，保持相同采样步数但能产生更高质量结果。

Result: 在多个数据集和基线模型上的实验表明，VRG能显著提高扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: VRG是一种有效的方法，能够减少扩散模型采样过程中的预测误差累积，提升生成质量，适用于条件和非条件生成任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become emerging generative models. Their sampling
process involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise
from a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from
the ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \textit{prediction error}.
The prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates
generation quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically
measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance
(VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or
modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new
trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher
quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional
generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG
can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models. Source

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为PCC-MJO的深度学习框架，作为通用后处理器来修正动力模型对MJO的预测，能够将有效预测范围延长2-8天，并有效缓解"海洋大陆障碍"问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MJO是影响全球天气和气候极端事件的重要驱动因子，但在业务动力模型中的预测仍具挑战性，有效预测通常仅限于3-4周。

Method: 采用两阶段模型：首先使用物理信息化的3D U-Net修正时空场误差，然后使用针对预测技能优化的LSTM来精炼MJO的RMM指数。

Result: 应用于CMA、ECMWF和NCEP三个不同业务预报时，该统一框架持续将有效预测范围（双变量相关>0.5）延长2-8天，有效缓解了"海洋大陆障碍"，实现了更真实的东向传播和振幅。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个物理一致、计算高效且高度可推广的途径，以突破次季节预测中长期存在的障碍，可解释AI分析证实模型决策与观测到的MJO动力学在空间上一致。

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an important driver of global weather
and climate extremes, but its prediction in operational dynamical models
remains challenging, with skillful forecasts typically limited to 3-4 weeks.
Here, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, the Physics-guided Cascaded
Corrector for MJO (PCC-MJO), which acts as a universal post-processor to
correct MJO forecasts from dynamical models. This two-stage model first employs
a physics-informed 3D U-Net to correct spatial-temporal field errors, then
refines the MJO's RMM index using an LSTM optimized for forecast skill. When
applied to three different operational forecasts from CMA, ECMWF and NCEP, our
unified framework consistently extends the skillful forecast range (bivariate
correlation > 0.5) by 2-8 days. Crucially, the model effectively mitigates the
"Maritime Continent barrier", enabling more realistic eastward propagation and
amplitude. Explainable AI analysis quantitatively confirms that the model's
decision-making is spatially congruent with observed MJO dynamics (correlation
> 0.93), demonstrating that it learns physically meaningful features rather
than statistical fittings. Our work provides a promising physically consistent,
computationally efficient, and highly generalizable pathway to break through
longstanding barriers in subseasonal forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流方法主要关注架构修改和基于优化的方法，但忽略了模态间不平衡程度的定量分析，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 定义模态间隙作为不同模态对真实类别预测的Softmax分数差异，用双峰高斯混合模型建模，计算样本属于平衡/不平衡分布的后验概率，设计三目标自适应损失函数，采用两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在CREMA-D和AVE数据集上分别达到80.65%和70.90%的准确率，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过定量分析多模态不平衡程度并设计自适应损失函数，有效解决了多模态不平衡问题，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Current mainstream approaches to addressing multimodal imbalance primarily
focus on architectural modifications and optimization-based, often overlooking
a quantitative analysis of the imbalance degree between modalities. To address
this gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of
multi-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level
adaptive loss function.We begin by defining the "Modality Gap" as the
difference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and
visual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap
distribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM). These two components are found to correspond respectively
to "modality-balanced" and "modality-imbalanced" data samples. Subsequently, we
apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each sample
belonging to these two distinct distributions.Informed by this quantitative
analysis, we design a novel adaptive loss function with three objectives: (1)
to minimize the overall Modality Gap; (2) to encourage the imbalanced sample
distribution to shift towards the balanced one; and (3) to apply greater
penalty weights to imbalanced samples. We employ a two-stage training strategy
consisting of a warm-up phase followed by an adaptive training
phase.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the public CREMA-D and AVE datasets,
attaining accuracies of $80.65\%$ and $70.90\%$, respectively. This validates
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

TL;DR: MARS-M是一种新的优化器，结合了MARS的方差缩减技术和Muon的矩阵预条件方法，在语言建模和计算机视觉任务中实现了更好的性能和更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 矩阵预条件优化器（如Muon）在大规模神经网络训练中比标量优化器更高效，而方差缩减技术（如MARS）在LLM预训练中能显著加速标准优化器。本文旨在结合这两种技术的优势。

Method: 将MARS的方差缩减技术与Muon优化器集成，创建新的MARS-M优化器。在标准正则条件下，证明了其收敛到一阶驻点的速率为$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$。

Result: 理论分析显示MARS-M的收敛速率从Muon的$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$提升到$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$。实验结果表明在语言建模和计算机视觉任务中，MARS-M能持续获得更低的损失和更好的下游基准性能。

Conclusion: MARS-M成功结合了矩阵预条件和方差缩减技术的优势，在理论和实验上都表现出优于单独使用Muon或MARS的性能，为大规模神经网络训练提供了更高效的优化方案。

Abstract: Matrix-based preconditioned optimizers, such as Muon, have recently been
shown to be more efficient than scalar-based optimizers for training
large-scale neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). On the
other hand, recent benchmarks on optimizers for LLM pre-training have
demonstrated that variance-reduction techniques such as MARS can achieve
substantial speedups over standard optimizers that do not employ variance
reduction. In this paper, to achieve the best of both worlds, we introduce
MARS-M, a new optimizer that integrates the variance reduction technique in
MARS with Muon. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove that Muon-M
converges to a first-order stationary point at a rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, which improves upon
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ rate attained by Muon. Our empirical results on
language modeling and computer vision tasks demonstrate that MARS-M
consistently yields lower losses and improved performance across various
downstream benchmarks. The implementation of MARS-M is available at

Method: 开发XRePIT混合模拟策略，将机器学习加速与求解器校正协同结合，设计为全自动且物理感知的方法。

Result: 实现了首个稳定加速滚转超过10000时间步长，对未见边界条件具有鲁棒泛化能力，可扩展到3D流动，速度提升达4.98倍，热场相对误差约1E-3，低幅度速度动态误差低于1E-2 ms-1。

Conclusion: 建立了一个成熟且可扩展的混合方法，为实际工程应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Purely data-driven surrogates for fluid dynamics often fail catastrophically
from error accumulation, while existing hybrid methods have lacked the
automation and robustness for practical use. To solve this, we developed
XRePIT, a novel hybrid simulation strategy that synergizes machine learning
(ML) acceleration with solver-based correction. We specifically designed our
method to be fully automated and physics-aware, ensuring the stability and
practical applicability that previous approaches lacked. We demonstrate that
this new design overcomes long-standing barriers, achieving the first stable,
accelerated rollouts for over 10,000 timesteps. The method also generalizes
robustly to unseen boundary conditions and, crucially, scales to 3D flows. Our
approach delivers speedups up to 4.98$\times$ while maintaining high physical
fidelity, resolving thermal fields with relative errors of ~1E-3 and capturing
low magnitude velocity dynamics with errors below 1E-2 ms-1. This work thus
establishes a mature and scalable hybrid method, paving the way for its use in
real-world engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机场雾预报模型在地理泛化方面的挑战，因为许多机器学习模型依赖位置特定特征而无法跨站点迁移。

Method: 使用梯度提升分类器(XGBoost)，在圣地亚哥机场数据上训练，采用基于热力学和辐射过程的无坐标特征集，并在其他三个机场进行严格的零样本测试。

Result: 模型在相距11650公里的不同机场和雾类型(辐射雾、平流雾、海雾)上都取得了0.923-0.947的AUC值，SHAP特征分析显示能见度持续性、太阳角度和热梯度是主导预测因子。

Conclusion: 基于物理过程的无坐标特征工程可以产生地理可迁移的大气预报工具，模型学习到了可迁移的物理关系而非站点特定模式。

Abstract: Short-term forecasting of airport fog (visibility < 1.0 km) presents
challenges in geographic generalization because many machine learning models
rely on location-specific features and fail to transfer across sites. This
study investigates whether fundamental thermodynamic and radiative processes
can be encoded in a coordinate-free (location-independent) feature set to
enable geographic transferability. A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost)
trained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL, 33S) data from 2002-2009 was evaluated on a
2010-2012 holdout set and under strict zero-shot tests at Puerto Montt (SCTE),
San Francisco (KSFO), and London (EGLL). The model achieved AUC values of
0.923-0.947 across distances up to 11,650 km and different fog regimes
(radiative, advective, marine). Consistent SHAP feature rankings show that
visibility persistence, solar angle, and thermal gradients dominate
predictions, suggesting the model learned transferable physical relationships
rather than site-specific patterns. Results suggest that physics-informed,
coordinate-free feature engineering can yield geographically transferable
atmospheric forecasting tools.

Motivation: 高维数据集在基因组学、医疗和金融领域的激增，需要既准确又可解释的机器学习模型。传统深度学习方法缺乏透明度，阻碍了在关键决策应用中的部署。

Method: 提出分层注意力可解释网络(HAIN)，整合多级注意力机制、降维和解释驱动损失函数，通过梯度加权注意力提供特征级可解释性，通过原型表示提供全局模型解释。

Conclusion: HAIN通过协调预测准确性和可解释性，推进了精准医疗和监管合规的透明AI解决方案发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as genomics,
healthcare, and finance has created an urgent need for machine learning models
that are both highly accurate and inherently interpretable. While traditional
deep learning approaches deliver strong predictive performance, their lack of
transparency often impedes their deployment in critical, decision-sensitive
applications. In this work, we introduce the Hierarchical Attention-based
Interpretable Network (HAIN), a novel architecture that unifies multi-level
attention mechanisms, dimensionality reduction, and explanation-driven loss
functions to deliver interpretable and robust analysis of complex biomedical
data. HAIN provides feature-level interpretability via gradientweighted
attention and offers global model explanations through prototype-based
representations. Comprehensive evaluation on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset demonstrates that HAIN achieves a classification accuracy of 94.3%,
surpassing conventional post-hoc interpretability approaches such as SHAP and
LIME in both transparency and explanatory power. Furthermore, HAIN effectively
identifies biologically relevant cancer biomarkers, supporting its utility for
clinical and research applications. By harmonizing predictive accuracy with
interpretability, HAIN advances the development of transparent AI solutions for
precision medicine and regulatory compliance.

Motivation: 时间序列是高维复杂数据对象，其高效搜索和索引一直是数据挖掘领域的长期挑战。本文旨在研究新提出的多尺度Dubuc距离(MDD)相对于广泛使用的动态时间规整(DTW)的比较优势和局限性。

Method: 使用多尺度Dubuc距离(MDD)评估时间序列相似性，该方法在两个关键方面具有创新性：在多时间尺度上评估相似性，并避免点对点对齐。通过模拟实验和UCR档案中的95个数据集进行测试，并在真实世界分类任务中应用两种方法进行比较。

Result: 研究表明，在许多场景下MDD显著优于DTW，特别是在多尺度分析和避免点对点对齐方面表现更好。在真实世界分类任务中，MDD相比DTW带来了显著改进。

Conclusion: 多尺度Dubuc距离(MDD)在时间序列相似性度量中具有实际应用价值，特别是在需要多尺度分析和避免点对点对齐的场景下，能够提供比动态时间规整(DTW)更好的性能。

Abstract: Time series are high-dimensional and complex data objects, making their
efficient search and indexing a longstanding challenge in data mining. Building
on a recently introduced similarity measure, namely Multiscale Dubuc Distance
(MDD), this paper investigates its comparative strengths and limitations
relative to the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). MDD is novel in two key
ways: it evaluates time series similarity across multiple temporal scales and
avoids point-to-point alignment. We demonstrate that in many scenarios where
MDD outperforms DTW, the gains are substantial, and we provide a detailed
analysis of the specific performance gaps it addresses. We provide simulations,
in addition to the 95 datasets from the UCR archive, to test our hypotheses.
Finally, we apply both methods to a challenging real-world classification task
and show that MDD yields a significant improvement over DTW, underscoring its
practical utility.

Motivation: 现实世界代码编辑场景中，奖励分布通常偏斜且存在不可预测的异常值，导致优势计算失真和噪声增加，现有GRPO等方法对此处理不足。

Method: GAPO为每个提示自适应寻找无异常值的高密度区间，使用该区间中位数作为自适应Q值替代组均值进行优势计算，保持即插即用和高效率。

Result: 在9个指令调优LLM（3B-14B）和包含51,844个真实世界代码编辑任务的大规模数据集上验证，GAPO在精确匹配准确率上相比GRPO及其变体DAPO取得了一致性改进。

Conclusion: GAPO能够鲁棒处理偏斜分布，在代码编辑的强化学习后训练中表现优于现有方法，代码已公开。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language
models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods like GRPO are
popular for their critic-free, normalized advantage estimation. However, in
real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with
unpredictable outliers, leading to distorted advantage computation and
increased noise. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy
Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an outlier-free highest-density
interval (HDI) per prompt and then uses the median of that interval as an
adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation. This adaptive Q
robustly handles skewed distributions while remaining plug-and-play and
efficient. We validate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a
large internal dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks
across 10 languages, demonstrating consistent improvements in exact match
accuracy over GRPO and its variant DAPO. Code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RestoreLCC方法，通过对比性激活编辑探测关键注意力头，提取丢失的激活组件并注入回剪枝后的注意力头，以恢复剪枝LLMs的性能而不影响稀疏性和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法主要针对密集模型设计，忽视了剪枝模型的独特特性，导致性能恢复效果不佳。剪枝引起的信息损失反映在注意力激活中，选择性恢复这些信息能显著提升模型性能。

Method: RestoreLCC方法：1）通过激活编辑对比性探测关键注意力头；2）从激活差异中提取丢失组件；3）将丢失组件注入回对应的剪枝注意力头进行补偿。支持结构化、半结构化和非结构化剪枝方案。

Result: 大量实验表明，RestoreLCC在通用和任务特定性能恢复方面始终优于最先进的基线方法，且不损害剪枝模型的稀疏性或推理效率。

Conclusion: RestoreLCC是一种即插即用的剪枝模型恢复方法，能够有效恢复性能同时保持低成本和高效性，兼容多种剪枝方案。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to reduce the size and inference cost of
large language models (LLMs), but it often causes performance degradation. To
mitigate this, existing restoration methods typically employ
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, to recover the pruned
model's performance. However, most PEFT methods are designed for dense models
and overlook the distinct properties of pruned models, often resulting in
suboptimal recovery. In this work, we propose a targeted restoration strategy
for pruned models that restores performance while preserving their low cost and
high efficiency. We observe that pruning-induced information loss is reflected
in attention activations, and selectively reintroducing components of this
information can significantly recover model performance. Based on this insight,
we introduce RestoreLCC (Restoring Pruned LLMs via Lost Component
Compensation), a plug-and-play method that contrastively probes critical
attention heads via activation editing, extracts lost components from
activation differences, and finally injects them back into the corresponding
pruned heads for compensation and recovery. RestoreLCC is compatible with
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured pruning schemes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RestoreLCC consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both general and task-specific performance
recovery, without compromising the sparsity or inference efficiency of pruned
models.

*Nayan Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个端到端的多任务系统，通过单张图像生成事实准确的商品描述。采用多任务学习训练视觉编码器，并结合分层生成过程来减少事实幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动生成商品描述和名称耗时耗力，现有视觉语言模型存在事实幻觉问题，且单任务模型无法捕捉特征间的相互依赖关系。

Method: 1. 多任务学习：单一视觉主干网络联合训练属性预测（颜色、下摆、领型）和价格回归；2. 分层生成：将模型预测的属性嵌入提示词中，输入文本解码器以提高事实一致性。

Result: 多任务方法在价格回归上R2值提升3.6%，属性分类F1分数提升6.6%。分层生成将事实幻觉率从12.7%降至7.1%（相对减少44.5%），自回归文本生成延迟减少3.5倍。

Conclusion: 该架构在减少事实幻觉和提高效率方面表现优异，尽管在ROUGE-L得分上比直接视觉语言模型低3.5%。

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a
slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation
solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone
to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only
inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between
features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task
system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.
The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.
First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision
encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute
prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,
introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own
predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to
improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of
this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent
price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,
with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation
process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from
12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical
ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the
autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to
direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the
model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L
score.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型由于计算资源成本高，不适合频繁重训练和持续学习，更新模型获取新知识会导致灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 使用自编码器学习任务权重的低维嵌入，促进知识向新任务迁移，同时防止灾难性遗忘，无需数据回放或大量任务特定参数。

Result: 在不同数据集上的实证评估表明，该方法不仅克服了灾难性遗忘，还显著减少了参数使用和内存大小，在多个任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: COLA框架使LLM能够高效学习新任务，对先前任务的性能退化最小，且无需保留早期训练数据。

Abstract: Learning a set of tasks over time, also known as continual learning (CL), is
one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence due to
catastrophic forgetting. Large language models (LLMs) are often impractical to
frequent re-training and continual learning , due to high cost of computational
resources for training. Moreover, LLM are not suitable for continual learning
as updating these models over time for acquiring new knowledge leads to
overwrites existing knowledge leading to common phenomenon know as
\textit{catastrophic forgetting}. In this paper, we aim to address these
concerns using a novel framework , COLA that employs an autoencoder to learn
capture low-dimensional embeddings of the weights associated with various
tasks. Our approach facilitates the transfer of knowledge to new tasks while
preventing catastrophic forgetting, all without using data replay or a
substantial set of task-specific parameters. Our approach, COLA, makes the LLM
efficiently learn new tasks with minimal training, insignificant performance
degradation on previous tasks, and eliminates the need for retaining earlier
training data. Empirical evaluation on different datasets ranging from task
oriented dialouge system to intent classsfication datasets showcases that our
method not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting but also achieves significant
reduction in parameter usage and memory size, across multiple tasks and
outperforming the existing state of the art methods across multiple datasets.

Motivation: 大型语言模型参数规模庞大导致计算和环境负担严重，现有压缩方法忽略层间复杂相关性，需要更有效的压缩技术。

Method: 使用无限投影纠缠对态(iPEPS)和张量重整化群(TRG)收缩的量子启发的张量网络压缩方法，捕捉注意力机制和深层变换器中的多向纠缠。

Result: 在LLaMA-2 7B上实现93%内存减少、70%参数减少、50%训练加速、25%推理加速，仅损失2-3%准确率。

Conclusion: 现代LLM占据低维纠缠流形，KARIPAP方法证明了可扩展、节能和量子感知AI架构的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA drive rapid progress in
generative AI, yet their huge parameter scales create severe computational and
environmental burdens. High training costs, energy use, and limited device
deployment hinder accessibility. Existing compression - pruning, distillation,
low-rank, and quantization - reduces size but ignores complex inter-layer
correlations. We propose KARIPAP, a quantum-inspired tensor network compression
using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor
Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction. Unlike 1D Matrix Product States, iPEPS
captures multi-directional entanglement in attention and deep transformer
layers. TRG ensures polynomial-time contraction, making tensorization feasible
while preserving key correlation geometry. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B show up to
93% memory and 70% parameter reduction, with 50% faster training, 25% faster
inference, and only 2-3% accuracy loss. Layer-wise entanglement profiling
reveals redundancy in deeper layers, confirming their suitability for tensor
factorization. KARIPAP demonstrates that modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional
entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-aware
AI architectures.

Motivation: 现有成员推理攻击方法依赖影子模型或大量查询，实用性受限。需要开发更高效、实用的隐私攻击方法。

Method: 利用高斯过程元建模，从单一训练模型中提取准确率、熵、数据集统计等后验指标，训练GP分类器来识别成员与非成员，并提供校准的不确定性估计。

Result: 在合成数据、真实欺诈检测数据、CIFAR-10和WikiText-2上的实验表明，GP-MIA实现了高准确率和良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GP-MIA为现有成员推理攻击提供了实用的替代方案，具有高效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) test whether a data point was part of a
model's training set, posing serious privacy risks. Existing methods often
depend on shadow models or heavy query access, which limits their practicality.
We propose GP-MIA, an efficient and interpretable approach based on Gaussian
process (GP) meta-modeling. Using post-hoc metrics such as accuracy, entropy,
dataset statistics, and optional sensitivity features (e.g. gradients, NTK
measures) from a single trained model, GP-MIA trains a GP classifier to
distinguish members from non-members while providing calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data,
CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2 show that GP-MIA achieves high accuracy and
generalizability, offering a practical alternative to existing MIAs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次将偏好优化引入降水临近预报，提出SynCast方法，通过两阶段后训练框架解决确定性模型的过度平滑和概率模型性能波动问题，协同优化冲突的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报面临确定性模型预测过度平滑、难以捕捉极端事件，以及概率模型性能波动、难以在冲突指标上同时取得最优表现的问题。

Method: 提出SynCast方法，采用扩散序列偏好优化(Diffusion-SPO)的两阶段后训练框架：第一阶段降低误报率，第二阶段在保持误报率对齐的基础上优化临界成功指数。

Result: 该方法能够协同改进冲突的评估指标，在误报率和临界成功指数上同时取得优异表现。

Conclusion: 偏好优化方法有效解决了降水临近预报中评估指标冲突的挑战，为极端天气监测和防灾减灾提供了更可靠的预测工具。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting based on radar echoes plays a crucial role in
monitoring extreme weather and supporting disaster prevention. Although deep
learning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable
limitations. For example, deterministic models tend to produce over-smoothed
predictions, which struggle to capture extreme events and fine-scale
precipitation patterns. Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent
randomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and
rarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation
nowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are
inherently conflicting. For instance, there is often a trade-off between the
Critical Success Index (CSI) and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), making it
challenging for existing models to deliver forecasts that perform well on both
metrics simultaneously. To address these challenges, we introduce preference
optimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the
success of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.
Specifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage
post-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization
(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently
achieve superior performance. In the first stage, the framework focuses on
reducing FAR, training the model to effectively suppress false alarms. Building
on this foundation, the second stage further optimizes CSI with constraints
that preserve FAR alignment, thereby achieving synergistic improvements across
these conflicting metrics.

TL;DR: TowerVision是一个基于多语言文本模型Tower+构建的开源多语言视觉语言模型家族，在图像文本和视频文本任务中表现出色，特别是在文化相关任务和多模态翻译方面超越了基于更大数据集训练的现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型大多采用英语中心化设计，限制了其在多语言环境中的有效性。本研究旨在通过分析多语言设计选择的影响，开发更有效的多语言视觉语言模型。

Method: 基于多语言文本模型Tower+构建TowerVision模型家族，分析训练数据组成、编码器选择和文本主干等设计选择的影响，并在微调过程中融入视觉和文化上下文。

Result: TowerVision在多个多模态多语言基准测试中取得竞争性表现，在ALM-Bench、Multi30K和ViMUL-Bench等任务上超越了基于更大数据集训练的现有方法，特别在文化相关任务和多模态翻译方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 多语言视觉语言训练数据显著改善了跨语言泛化能力，指令调优的大语言模型并非总是最优的初始化选择。研究公开了所有模型、数据和训练方法以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), most existing
work follows an English-centric design process, limiting their effectiveness in
multilingual settings. In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study
analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training
data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is
TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and
video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+.
TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal
multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded
tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context
during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on
substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image
tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release
VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings
highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially
improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to
underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs
are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research,
we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.

<details>

Motivation: 传统DEIM方法在投影基降阶模型中虽然能有效近似非线性项，但其固定的插值点限制了在复杂时变动力系统中的适应性。

Method: 开发了可微分自适应DEIM公式，允许神经网络动态选择插值点；并将DEIM作为分析工具来检查预训练NODE模型的学习动态。

Result: DEIM轨迹揭示了NODE学习动态中的物理意义特征，并暴露了其在未见流配置外推时的局限性。

Conclusion: DEIM不仅可以作为模型降维工具，还可以作为诊断框架来理解和改进神经微分方程模型的泛化行为。

Abstract: We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical
Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical
system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in
projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points
limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this
limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the
one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to
dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and
physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis
tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The
DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics
of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow
configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a
model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and
improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向多能源系统的隐私保护决策聚焦学习框架，通过信息掩蔽和安全协议解决传统方法中的隐私泄露问题，同时降低调度成本。


<details>

Motivation: 传统多能源系统负荷预测与决策分离，预测模型仅关注预测精度而忽略对下游决策的影响。决策聚焦学习虽能解决此问题，但在实际应用中面临严重的隐私挑战，需要跨部门共享敏感负荷数据和模型参数。

Method: 采用信息掩蔽技术保护私有数据，同时恢复模型训练所需的决策变量和梯度；设计结合矩阵分解和同态加密的安全协议防止共谋和未授权访问；开发隐私保护的负荷模式识别算法，为异质负荷模式训练专门的DFL模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的隐私保护DFL框架成功解决了多能源系统中决策聚焦学习的隐私挑战，在保障数据安全的同时提升了调度决策的经济性。

Abstract: Decision-making for multi-energy system (MES) dispatch depends on accurate
load forecasting. Traditionally, load forecasting and decision-making for MES
are implemented separately. Forecasting models are typically trained to
minimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream
decision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been
studied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption
of DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the process requires sharing
sensitive load data and model parameters across multiple sectors, raising
serious privacy issues. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL
framework tailored for MES. Our approach introduces information masking to
safeguard private data while enabling recovery of decision variables and
gradients required for model training. To further enhance security for DFL, we
design a safety protocol combining matrix decomposition and homomorphic
encryption, effectively preventing collusion and unauthorized data access.
Additionally, we developed a privacy-preserving load pattern recognition
algorithm, enabling the training of specialized DFL models for heterogeneous
load patterns. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive case studies, including
real-world MES data, demonstrate that our framework not only protects privacy
but also consistently achieves lower average daily dispatch costs compared to
existing methods.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of deep learning, applying such techniques to EM
methods has emerged as a promising research direction to overcome the
limitations of conventional approaches. The effectiveness of deep learning
methods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences
model performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies
often construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple
three-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real
geological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly
available three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress
in deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present
OpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset
that encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.
OpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple
configurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures
such as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their
corresponding variants with anomalous bodies. Since three-dimensional forward
modeling in electromagnetics is extremely time-consuming, we further developed
a deep learning based fast forward modeling approach for OpenEM, enabling
efficient and reliable forward modeling across the entire dataset. This
capability allows OpenEM to be rapidly deployed for a wide range of tasks.
OpenEM provides a unified, comprehensive, and large-scale dataset for common EM
exploration systems to accelerate the application of deep learning in
electromagnetic methods. The complete dataset, along with the forward modeling
codes and trained models, is publicly available at

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型的反思推理能力，测试无外部反馈的递归自我评估是否真正产生进展，还是仅仅是形式上的重新表述。

Method: 在三个模型（GPT-4o-mini、Claude 3 Haiku、Gemini 2.0 Flash）和四个任务族（算术、代码、解释、反思）上进行144个推理序列测试，每个序列迭代10次，比较无基础自批判和最小基础干预两种条件。

Conclusion: 反思没有外部接触会导致信息封闭，最小基础干预作为耗散耦合重新引入信息流。结果揭示了生成推理中自我纠正的结构限制，并为基于基础的协作推理设计提供了原则。

Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning,
yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields
reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider
study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini,
Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families
(arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two
conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a
single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta
I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to
late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all
three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change
immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter.
Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level
entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward
informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on
self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information
with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an
attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative
coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency
suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives
rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when
reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles
for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

Abstract: This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development
of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations
arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a
forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data
distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate
distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise
back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three
complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational
autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The
score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the
evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely
regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation
as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a
learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a
time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.
Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise
into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph
discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,
and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between
arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded
understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning
knowledge.

machine learning. The method proposed in this work consists of a hybrid linear
feature extraction scheme to be used in supervised multi-class classification
problems. Inspired by two recent linear discriminant methods: robust sparse
linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsitybased
discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), we propose a unifying
criterion that is able to retain the advantages of these two powerful methods.
The resulting transformation relies on sparsity-promoting techniques both to
select the features that most accurately represent the data and to preserve the
row-sparsity consistency property of samples from the same class. The linear
transformation and the orthogonal matrix are estimated using an iterative
alternating minimization scheme based on steepest descent gradient method and
different initialization schemes. The proposed framework is generic in the
sense that it allows the combination and tuning of other linear discriminant
embedding methods. According to the experiments conducted on several datasets
including faces, objects, and digits, the proposed method was able to
outperform competing methods in most cases.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的对抗性训练范式ASCoT，通过将对抗技能分解为稀疏基元词典，并训练模型识别这些技能的组合，显著提高了对未见越狱攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法难以防御新出现的越狱攻击，因为传统方法面临优化挑战和威胁模型定义困难。作者假设新越狱攻击本质上是已有对抗技能的重新组合。

Method: 通过分析32篇攻击论文，提取并压缩对抗技能为稀疏基元词典，使用LLM生成可读描述。然后提出ASCoT方法，训练模型识别技能基元的多样化组合而非孤立攻击实例。

Result: ASCoT显著提高了对未见攻击（包括多轮越狱）的鲁棒性，同时保持较低的过度拒绝率。研究表明扩展对抗技能覆盖范围比单纯增加数据规模更关键。

Conclusion: 对抗性技能组合训练是防御新型越狱攻击的有效方法，验证了对抗性既视感假设：新攻击主要是已有技能的组合。

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Defending against novel jailbreaks
represents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed
to make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant
paradigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges
and difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training
methods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper
proposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,
centered on the Adversarial D\'ej\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not
fundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from
previous attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32
attack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract
and compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with
LLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen
attacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,
with explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided
by this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),
which trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated
attack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,
including multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We
also demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data
scale, is key to defending against novel attacks.

Conclusion: 框架支持治理约束包括符号限制、稀疏性和对现有工具的最小修改，确保在临床工作流程中的实际可部署性

Abstract: Risk assessment tools in healthcare commonly employ point-based scoring
systems that map patients to ordinal risk categories via thresholds. While
electronic health record (EHR) data presents opportunities for data-driven
optimization of these tools, two fundamental challenges impede standard
supervised learning: (1) partial supervision arising from intervention-censored
outcomes, where only extreme categories can be reliably labeled, and (2)
asymmetric misclassification costs that increase with ordinal distance. We
propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework that jointly optimizes
scoring weights and category thresholds under these constraints. Our approach
handles partial supervision through per-instance feasible label sets,
incorporates asymmetric distance-aware objectives, and prevents middle-category
collapse via minimum threshold gaps. We further develop a CSO relaxation using
softplus losses that preserves the ordinal structure while enabling efficient
optimization. The framework supports governance constraints including sign
restrictions, sparsity, and minimal modifications to incumbent tools, ensuring
practical deployability in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Novelty detection in large scientific datasets faces two key challenges: the
noisy and high-dimensional nature of experimental data, and the necessity of
making statistically robust statements about any observed outliers. While there
is a wealth of literature on anomaly detection via dimensionality reduction,
most methods do not produce outputs compatible with quantifiable claims of
scientific discovery. In this work we directly address these challenges,
presenting the first step towards a unified pipeline for novelty detection
adapted for the rigorous statistical demands of science. We introduce
AutoSciDACT (Automated Scientific Discovery with Anomalous Contrastive
Testing), a general-purpose pipeline for detecting novelty in scientific data.
AutoSciDACT begins by creating expressive low-dimensional data representations
using a contrastive pre-training, leveraging the abundance of high-quality
simulated data in many scientific domains alongside expertise that can guide
principled data augmentation strategies. These compact embeddings then enable
an extremely sensitive machine learning-based two-sample test using the New
Physics Learning Machine (NPLM) framework, which identifies and statistically
quantifies deviations in observed data relative to a reference distribution
(null hypothesis). We perform experiments across a range of astronomical,
physical, biological, image, and synthetic datasets, demonstrating strong
sensitivity to small injections of anomalous data across all domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近研究发现神经网络存在瓶颈秩特性：深度较大时，梯度方法训练的神经网络激活和权重往往近似低秩。本文旨在探讨这一现象对泛化能力的影响。

Method: 利用权重矩阵的近似低秩结构，基于Schatten p拟范数建立泛化边界理论分析。

Result: 当p较小时，泛化边界表现出样本复杂度为O(WrL²)，其中W、L、r分别是网络宽度、深度和权重矩阵秩；当p增大时，边界表现更接近基于范数的边界。

Conclusion: 神经网络的瓶颈秩特性可用于建立更紧致的泛化边界，为理解深度网络泛化能力提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: It has been recently observed in much of the literature that neural networks
exhibit a bottleneck rank property: for larger depths, the activation and
weights of neural networks trained with gradient-based methods tend to be of
approximately low rank. In fact, the rank of the activations of each layer
converges to a fixed value referred to as the ``bottleneck rank'', which is the
minimum rank required to represent the training data. This perspective is in
line with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without
activations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$
quasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications
of this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove
generalization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low
rank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the
Schatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds
exhibit a sample complexity $ \widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the
width and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of
the weight matrices. As $p$ increases, the bound behaves more like a norm-based
bound instead.

Abstract: Spectral decomposition of linear operators plays a central role in many areas
of machine learning and scientific computing. Recent work has explored training
neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling
scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial
differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical
optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the
\emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for
solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple
linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal
connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared
independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its
broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to
train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and
demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our
results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens
of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for
deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and
scalable tools for machine learning.

Motivation: Transformer架构中的常规注意力机制时间复杂度为O(N²D)，而线性注意力虽然理论上有线性复杂度O(ND²)，但在实践中效率落后于理论预期。

Method: 开发了线性注意力的新前向和后向传播算法，并实现了高度优化的CUDA代码实现。

Result: 在单层和端到端设置中验证，速度比现有技术快3.3倍，内存消耗减少3.6倍；训练的14亿参数语言模型在主要推理基准测试中表现出与常规注意力相似的表达能力。

Conclusion: 提出的优化线性注意力方法在保持表达能力的同时，显著提升了运行效率和内存使用效率。

Abstract: The original softmax-based attention mechanism (regular attention) in the
extremely successful Transformer architecture computes attention between $N$
tokens, each embedded in a $D$-dimensional head, with a time complexity of
$O(N^2D)$. Given the success of Transformers, improving their runtime during
both training and inference is a popular research area. One such approach is
the introduction of the linear attention (LA) mechanisms, which offers a linear
time complexity of $O(ND^2)$ and have demonstrated comparable accuracy to
regular attention. However, LA in practice lags behind its theoretical
efficiency. We propose a novel method for LA's forward and backward passes,
along with a highly-optimized CUDA implementation. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 3.3 times in speed and reduces memory consumption by 3.6
times. We validate these improvements in both single-layer and end-to-end
settings by training a 1.4 billion parameter language model, which demonstrates
similar expressivity to regular attention on major reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: PUNT是一种模型无关的采样器，通过识别token依赖关系并移除冲突组中低置信度token，在保持条件独立性的同时优先处理高置信度预测，实现高效的并行文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型(MDMs)相比自回归模型(ARMs)具有并行采样的优势，但并行采样面临两个冲突要求：同时更新的token必须条件独立，而更新应优先处理高置信度预测。高置信度预测往往相互依赖，限制了并行更新的机会。

Method: PUNT通过近似条件独立性测试识别token依赖关系，移除冲突组中低置信度token，生成满足独立性和置信度标准的索引集，实现优化的并行解掩码。

Result: 在IFEval基准测试中，PUNT比基线方法（包括顺序生成）准确率提高达16%，在生成长序列时表现更佳，且对超参数不敏感，无需精细调参。

Conclusion: PUNT在准确性和计算效率之间实现了优越的权衡，并诱导出层次化生成策略，模型先建立高级段落结构再进行局部优化，表现出类似规划的生成功效。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive models (ARMs) for discrete text generation because they enable
parallel token sampling, rather than sequential, left-to-right generation. This
means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling
faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be
conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence
predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often
cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.
  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our
method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from
conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy
both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved
parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.
  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy
and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially
for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to
16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation
(one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters,
mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe
that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model
first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement,
suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong
alignment performance.

Motivation: 传统Jump Gaussian Processes在高维输入空间中存在局限性，需要一种能够有效处理高维分段连续函数的方法。

Method: DJGP在JGP基础上添加局部线性投影层，使用区域特定矩阵捕捉局部子空间结构，并对投影矩阵施加高斯过程先验以控制模型复杂度，采用可扩展变分推理算法联合学习投影矩阵和JGP超参数。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，DJGP相比现有方法具有更优越的预测精度和更可靠的不确定性量化。

Conclusion: DJGP通过两层的深度GP/JGP学习框架，成功解决了高维分段连续函数的建模问题，在预测性能和不确定性量化方面表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce Deep Jump Gaussian Processes (DJGP), a novel method for
surrogate modeling of high-dimensional piecewise continuous functions. DJGP
overcomes the limitations of conventional Jump Gaussian Processes in
high-dimensional input spaces by adding a locally linear projection layer to
Jump Gaussian Processes. This projection uses region-specific matrices to
capture local subspace structures, naturally complementing the localized nature
of JGP, a variant of local Gaussian Processes. To control model complexity, we
place a Gaussian Process prior on the projection matrices, allowing them to
evolve smoothly across the input space. The projected inputs are then modeled
with a JGP to capture piecewise continuous relationships with the response.
This yields a distinctive two-layer deep learning of GP/JGP. We further develop
a scalable variational inference algorithm to jointly learn the projection
matrices and JGP hyperparameters. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that DJGP delivers superior predictive accuracy and more
reliable uncertainty quantification compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练虽然能提升数学和多模态推理能力，但会导致基础能力（如感知和忠实性）的衰退。现有正则化方法如KL散度只能保证当前任务不偏离，无法保护更广泛的知识。

Method: 提出RECAP方法——具有动态目标重加权的回放策略。通过在线调整权重，基于收敛和不稳定性信号，将训练重点从饱和目标转向表现不佳或波动的目标。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B和Qwen2.5-VL-7B上的实验表明，该方法有效保护通用能力，同时通过更灵活的任务奖励权衡提升推理性能。

Conclusion: RECAP是端到端的解决方案，无需额外模型训练或大量调参，可直接应用于现有RLVR流程，有效解决能力衰退问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has delivered
impressive gains in mathematical and multimodal reasoning and has become a
standard post-training paradigm for contemporary language and vision-language
models. However, the RLVR recipe introduces a significant risk of capability
regression, where models forget foundational skills after prolonged training
without employing regularization strategies. We empirically confirm this
concern, observing that open-source reasoning models suffer performance
degradation on core capabilities such as perception and faithfulness. While
imposing regularization terms like KL divergence can help prevent deviation
from the base model, these terms are calculated on the current task, thus they
do not guarantee broader knowledge. Meanwhile, commonly used experience replay
across heterogeneous domains makes it nontrivial to decide how much training
focus each objective should receive. To address this, we propose RECAP-a replay
strategy with dynamic objective reweighting for general knowledge preservation.
Our reweighting mechanism adapts in an online manner using short-horizon
signals of convergence and instability, shifting the post-training focus away
from saturated objectives and toward underperforming or volatile ones. Our
method is end-to-end and readily applicable to existing RLVR pipelines without
training additional models or heavy tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmarks
based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, which not only preserves general capabilities but also improves
reasoning by enabling more flexible trade-offs among in-task rewards.

Motivation: 传统生物化学中的机器学习方法通常使用单一图（如最小自由能结构）来表示分子，但这种方法无法充分反映热力学平衡下的低能构象集合。实验偏差（如PCR扩增或测序噪声）会掩盖真实的适配体-配体亲和力。

Method: 引入热力学参数化的指数族随机图嵌入，将分子建模为玻尔兹曼加权的相互作用图集合，而非单一图结构。

Result: 该方法在SELEX数据集上表现出色，即使在存在偏差观测的情况下，也能实现稳健的群落检测和子图级亲和力解释，有助于识别低丰度适配体候选物。

Conclusion: 这种基于图集合的嵌入方法能够克服实验偏差，为适配体-配体亲和力分析提供更可靠的工具，有望用于识别值得进一步实验评估的低丰度候选物。

Abstract: Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as
graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure
predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free
energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative
of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically
parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models
molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate
this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR
amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity,
producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their
actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust
community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand
affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be
used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental
evaluation.

Motivation: 挑战强化学习领域的传统观念：通常认为只有TD方法能实现经验缝合，而MC方法不能。但在函数逼近设置下，轨迹从不交叉，这种传统智慧是否成立需要验证。

Method: 通过实证研究比较MC和TD方法在函数逼近设置下的表现，评估不同神经网络容量对经验缝合能力的影响。

Result: MC方法也能实现经验缝合，TD方法仅略优于MC方法，但神经网络容量的提升对缝合能力的改善远大于算法选择的影响。

Conclusion: 在大型模型时代，传统的TD归纳偏差可能不再必要，经验缝合可以通过模型规模而非专门算法实现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to solve long-horizon tasks even when
training data contains only short fragments of the behaviors. This experience
stitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference (TD)
methods. However, outside of small tabular settings, trajectories never
intersect, calling into question this conventional wisdom. Moreover, the common
belief is that Monte Carlo (MC) methods should not be able to recombine
experience, yet it remains unclear whether function approximation could result
in a form of implicit stitching. The goal of this paper is to empirically study
whether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings
where function approximation is used. We empirically demonstrate that Monte
Carlo (MC) methods can also achieve experience stitching. While TD methods do
achieve slightly stronger capabilities than MC methods (in line with
conventional wisdom), that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between
small and large neural networks (even on quite simple tasks). We find that
increasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both
the MC and TD methods. These results suggest that the traditional TD inductive
bias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for RL and,
in some cases, may offer diminishing returns. Additionally, our results suggest
that stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be
achieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but
rather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other
machine learning settings (via scale). Project website:

Result: 实验证实了理论发现，表明在因果可解释性和预测准确性之间存在基本权衡。

Conclusion: 通过设计构建因果可解释模型是可行的，但需要在可解释性和预测性能之间进行权衡。

Abstract: Understanding the predictions made by deep learning models remains a central
challenge, especially in high-stakes applications. A promising approach is to
equip models with the ability to answer counterfactual questions --
hypothetical ``what if?'' scenarios that go beyond the observed data and
provide insight into a model reasoning. In this work, we introduce the notion
of causal interpretability, which formalizes when counterfactual queries can be
evaluated from a specific class of models and observational data. We analyze
two common model classes -- blackbox and concept-based predictors -- and show
that neither is causally interpretable in general. To address this gap, we
develop a framework for building models that are causally interpretable by
design. Specifically, we derive a complete graphical criterion that determines
whether a given model architecture supports a given counterfactual query. This
leads to a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive
accuracy, which we characterize by identifying the unique maximal set of
features that yields an interpretable model with maximal predictive
expressiveness. Experiments corroborate the theoretical findings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方法假设完美伪随机性，但实际中生成文本的重复会导致结构化依赖，损害I类错误控制并使标准分析无效。

Method: 引入统计框架，通过分层两阶段分区捕获结构依赖，核心是最小单元概念——跨单元独立但单元内允许依赖的最小分组。基于最小单元定义非渐近效率度量，将水印检测建模为极小极大假设检验问题。

Result: 应用于Gumbel-max和逆变换水印，框架产生闭式最优规则。理论解释了为何丢弃重复统计量能改善性能，并表明除非退化否则必须处理单元内依赖。理论和实验都证实了检测能力的提升和严格的I类错误控制。

Conclusion: 为不完美伪随机性下的水印检测提供了首个原则性基础，为模型输出的可靠追踪提供了理论洞见和实践指导。

Abstract: Text watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and
accountability of large language model (LLM) outputs and mitigating misuse.
While promising, most existing methods assume perfect pseudorandomness. In
practice, repetition in generated text induces collisions that create
structured dependence, compromising Type I error control and invalidating
standard analyses.
  We introduce a statistical framework that captures this structure through a
hierarchical two-layer partition. At its core is the concept of minimal units
-- the smallest groups treatable as independent across units while permitting
dependence within. Using minimal units, we define a non-asymptotic efficiency
measure and cast watermark detection as a minimax hypothesis testing problem.
  Applied to Gumbel-max and inverse-transform watermarks, our framework
produces closed-form optimal rules. It explains why discarding repeated
statistics often improves performance and shows that within-unit dependence
must be addressed unless degenerate. Both theory and experiments confirm
improved detection power with rigorous Type I error control. These results
provide the first principled foundation for watermark detection under imperfect
pseudorandomness, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for
reliable tracing of model outputs.

Abstract: Computationally predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is challenging
due to the lack of integrated, multimodal protein representations. DPEB is a
curated collection of 22,043 human proteins that integrates four embedding
types: structural (AlphaFold2), transformer-based sequence (BioEmbeddings),
contextual amino acid patterns (ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling), and
sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec]). AlphaFold2 protein structures are
available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure
Database), but the internal neural network embeddings are not. DPEB addresses
this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling.
Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest
PPI prediction performance (87.37% AUROC, 79.16% accuracy). The framework also
achieved 77.42% accuracy for enzyme classification and 86.04% accuracy for
protein family classification. DPEB supports multiple graph neural network
methods for PPI prediction, enabling applications in systems biology, drug
target identification, pathway analysis, and disease mechanism studies.

Method: 定义了加权准确率(WA)，这是一个与最小化TCC一致的评估指标。提出了在缺乏完全指定误分类成本情况下估计WA权重参数的程序，并分析了WA与TCC在示例依赖场景中的相关性。

Result: WA提供了一个直观的加权版本准确率指标，与最小化总分类成本一致。该框架允许在不同数据集间比较结果，并解决开发数据集与目标数据集之间的差异。

Conclusion: WA是一个与最小化总分类成本一致的稳健评估指标，澄清了在成本敏感场景中处理类别不平衡的概念框架，为重新平衡技术提供了替代方案。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate evaluation metric for classifiers is crucial for
model comparison and parameter optimization, yet there is not consensus on a
universally accepted metric that serves as a definitive standard. Moreover,
there is often a misconception about the perceived need to mitigate imbalance
in datasets used to train classification models. Since the final goal in
classifier optimization is typically maximizing the return of investment or,
equivalently, minimizing the Total Classification Cost (TCC), we define
Weighted Accuracy (WA), an evaluation metric for binary classifiers with a
straightforward interpretation as a weighted version of the well-known accuracy
metric, coherent with the need of minimizing TCC. We clarify the conceptual
framework for handling class imbalance in cost-sensitive scenarios, providing
an alternative to rebalancing techniques. This framework can be applied to any
metric that, like WA, can be expressed as a linear combination of
example-dependent quantities and allows for comparing the results obtained in
different datasets and for addressing discrepancies between the development
dataset, used to train and validate the model, and the target dataset, where
the model will be deployed. It also specifies in which scenarios using
UCCs-unaware class rebalancing techniques or rebalancing metrics aligns with
TCC minimization and when it is instead counterproductive. Finally, we propose
a procedure to estimate the WA weight parameter in the absence of fully
specified UCCs and demonstrate the robustness of WA by analyzing its
correlation with TCC in example-dependent scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL算法假设公民会遵循政府制定的政策，但实际中缺乏制度信任时公民不会遵循政策。本文旨在将制度信任纳入RL算法设计。

Method: 使用深度确定性策略梯度方法学习资源分配策略，模拟资源分配过程并建模社区成员制度信任的变化，研究信任对结果的影响。

Result: 将信任纳入RL算法能带来更成功的政策，特别是当组织目标不确定时；更保守的信任估计能提高公平性和平均社区信任，但会降低组织成功率；配额系统干预能在某些情况下改善公平性和信任。

Conclusion: 制度信任在算法设计和实施中至关重要，组织成功与社区福祉之间存在张力，需要平衡算法效率和社区信任关系。

Abstract: Many governmental bodies are adopting AI policies for decision-making. In
particular, Reinforcement Learning has been used to design policies that
citizens would be expected to follow if implemented. Much RL work assumes that
citizens follow these policies, and evaluate them with this in mind. However,
we know from prior work that without institutional trust, citizens will not
follow policies put in place by governments. In this work, we develop a
trust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities. We consider
the case of humanitarian engineering, where the organization is aiming to
distribute some technology or resource to community members. We use a Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient approach to learn a resource allocation that fits
the needs of the organization. Then, we simulate resource allocation according
to the learned policy, and model the changes in institutional trust of
community members. We investigate how this incorporation of institutional trust
affects outcomes, and ask how effectively an organization can learn policies if
trust values are private. We find that incorporating trust into RL algorithms
can lead to more successful policies, specifically when the organization's
goals are less certain. We find more conservative trust estimates lead to
increased fairness and average community trust, though organization success
suffers. Finally, we explore a strategy to prevent unfair outcomes to
communities. We implement a quota system by an external entity which decreases
the organization's utility when it does not serve enough community members. We
find this intervention can improve fairness and trust among communities in some
cases, while decreasing the success of the organization. This work underscores
the importance of institutional trust in algorithm design and implementation,
and identifies a tension between organization success and community well-being.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-DAREK是一种基于KKAN架构的新型学习算法，通过距离感知误差边界实现高效、可解释的函数逼近和不确定性量化，在安全控制任务中表现出比Ensemble of KANs、GP和DAREK更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络架构选择影响可解释性、效率和泛化能力，而高斯过程在大规模问题上计算成本高。KKAN通过减少样条层并使用Chebyshev层和MLP来提高训练稳定性，但需要进一步改进以实现更好的不确定性量化。

Method: 基于KKAN架构开发K-DAREK算法，通过距离感知误差边界来反映测试点与最近训练点的接近程度，实现高效且可解释的函数逼近。

Result: 在安全控制任务中，K-DAREK比Ensemble of KANs快约4倍、计算效率高10倍，比GP可扩展性高8.6倍，比DAREK安全性高50%。

Conclusion: K-DAREK通过距离感知误差边界在函数逼近中实现了高效性、可解释性和不确定性量化，为系统建模提供了强大的架构选择。

Abstract: Neural networks are parametric and powerful tools for function approximation,
and the choice of architecture heavily influences their interpretability,
efficiency, and generalization. In contrast, Gaussian processes (GPs) are
nonparametric probabilistic models that define distributions over functions
using a kernel to capture correlations among data points. However, these models
become computationally expensive for large-scale problems, as they require
inverting a large covariance matrix. Kolmogorov- Arnold networks (KANs),
semi-parametric neural architectures, have emerged as a prominent approach for
modeling complex functions with structured and efficient representations
through spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend this
idea by reducing the number of spline layers in KAN and replacing them with
Chebyshev layers and multi-layer perceptrons, thereby mapping inputs into
higher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations.
Compared to KANs, KKANs perform more stable convergence during training, making
them a strong architecture for estimating operators and system modeling in
dynamical systems. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel
learning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks
(K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with
uncertainty quantification. Our approach establishes robust error bounds that
are distance-aware; this means they reflect the proximity of a test point to
its nearest training points. Through case studies on a safe control task, we
demonstrate that K-DAREK is about four times faster and ten times higher
computationally efficiency than Ensemble of KANs, 8.6 times more scalable than
GP by increasing the data size, and 50% safer than our previous work
distance-aware error for Kolmogorov networks (DAREK).

Abstract: We study the effect of normalization schemes on token representations in deep

we show that normalization acts as a form of speed regulation. This perspective
enables a unified analysis of several schemes -- including Post-LN, Pre-LN,
Mix-LN, Peri-LN, nGPT, and LN-Scaling -- revealing how they influence
clustering dynamics and representation collapse. Our framework clarifies how
different schemes shape token representations across layers and provides a
principled basis for comparing them, identifying Peri-LN as a particularly
effective choice.

Abstract: We study the problem of Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL), where the
goal is to learn a reward-maximizing policy from fixed data under a cumulative
cost constraint. We propose a novel OSRL approach that frames the problem as a
minimax objective and solves it by combining offline RL with online
optimization algorithms. We prove the approximate optimality of this approach
when integrated with an approximate offline RL oracle and no-regret online
optimization. We also present a practical approximation that can be combined
with any offline RL algorithm, eliminating the need for offline policy
evaluation. Empirical results on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that our method
reliably enforces safety constraints under stringent cost budgets, while
achieving high rewards. The code is available at

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial
intelligence, with far-reaching implications for decision-making, predictions,
and interventions. Despite significant advances, existing methods can be
broadly categorized as constraint-based or score-based approaches.
Constraint-based methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered
by small sample sizes, while score-based methods provide flexible optimization
but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing. This work
explores a third avenue: developing differentiable $d$-separation scores,
obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic. This enables the
implementation of a new type of causal discovery method: gradient-based
optimization of conditional independence constraints. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in low-sample regimes,
surpassing traditional constraint-based and score-based baselines on a
real-world dataset. Code and data of the proposed method are publicly available
at https://github$.$com/PurdueMINDS/DAGPA.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了线性最优传输（LOT）框架，用于将单细胞技术生成的不规则点云嵌入到固定维度的欧几里得空间中，同时保持分布结构，实现准确分类和可解释性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞技术生成高维细胞点云，但每个患者的不规则点云难以直接量化和比较个体间生物差异。现有非线性方法如核方法和神经网络虽然预测准确，但缺乏生物可解释性。

Method: 采用线性最优传输（LOT）框架，将不规则点云嵌入到固定维度的欧几里得空间，保持最优传输几何结构，形成患者间的配准，支持直接比较细胞分布。

Result: LOT实现了COVID-19患者状态的准确可解释分类，分类器权重可映射回特定标记和空间区域；支持患者来源类器官的合成数据生成，利用LOT嵌入的线性性生成平均细胞谱。

Conclusion: LOT作为一个统一框架，桥接了预测性能、可解释性和生成建模，通过将异质点云转换为可直接追溯到原始数据的结构化嵌入，为理解高维生物系统中的免疫变异和治疗效果开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells,
enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment
responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather
than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare
biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels
and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes,
offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT)
framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a
fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure.
This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves
optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a
registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their
cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate
and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier
weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions;
and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids,
exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged
cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug
interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges
predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By
transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly
traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding
immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.

Abstract: The classic Mallows model is a foundational tool for modeling user
preferences. However, it has limitations in capturing real-world scenarios,
where users often focus only on a limited set of preferred items and are
indifferent to the rest. To address this, extensions such as the top-k Mallows
model have been proposed, aligning better with practical applications. In this
paper, we address several challenges related to the generalized top-k Mallows
model, with a focus on analyzing buyer choices. Our key contributions are: (1)
a novel sampling scheme tailored to generalized top-k Mallows models, (2) an
efficient algorithm for computing choice probabilities under this model, and
(3) an active learning algorithm for estimating the model parameters from
observed choice data. These contributions provide new tools for analysis and
prediction in critical decision-making scenarios. We present a rigorous
mathematical analysis for the performance of our algorithms. Furthermore,
through extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data, we
demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our proposed methods, and we
compare the predictive power of Mallows model for top-k lists compared to the
simpler Multinomial Logit model.

Abstract: Sampling from constrained statistical distributions is a fundamental task in
various fields including Bayesian statistics, computational chemistry, and
statistical physics. This article considers the cases where the constrained
distribution is described by an unconstrained density, as well as additional
equality and/or inequality constraints, which often make the constraint set
nonconvex. Existing methods for nonconvex constraint set $\Sigma \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by equality or inequality constraints commonly rely on
costly projection steps. Moreover, they cannot handle equality and inequality
constraints simultaneously as each method only specialized in one case. In
addition, rigorous and quantitative convergence guarantee is often lacking. In
this paper, we introduce Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA), a new
framework that can design overdamped Langevin dynamics accommodating both
equality and inequality constraints. The proposed dynamics also
deterministically corrects trajectories along the normal direction of the
constraint surface, thus obviating the need for explicit projections. We show
that, under suitable regularity conditions on the target density and $\Sigma$,
OLLA converges exponentially fast in $W_2$ distance to the constrained target
density $\rho_\Sigma(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))d\sigma_\Sigma$. Lastly, through
experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of OLLA compared to projection-based
constrained Langevin algorithms and their slack variable variants, highlighting
its favorable computational cost and reasonable empirical mixing.

Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are the backbone of real-time grid operations,
across workflows such as contingency analysis (where repeated PF evaluations
assess grid security under outages) and topology optimization (which involves
PF-based searches over combinatorially large action spaces). Running these
calculations at operational timescales or across large evaluation spaces
remains a major computational bottleneck. Additionally, growing uncertainty in
power system operations from the integration of renewables and climate-induced
extreme weather also calls for tools that can accurately and efficiently
simulate a wide range of scenarios and operating conditions. Machine learning
methods offer a potential speedup over traditional solvers, but their
performance has not been systematically assessed on benchmarks that capture
real-world variability. This paper introduces PF$\Delta$, a benchmark dataset
for power flow that captures diverse variations in load, generation, and
topology. PF$\Delta$ contains 859,800 solved power flow instances spanning six
different bus system sizes, capturing three types of contingency scenarios (N ,
N -1, and N -2), and including close-to-infeasible cases near steady-state
voltage stability limits. We evaluate traditional solvers and GNN-based
methods, highlighting key areas where existing approaches struggle, and
identifying open problems for future research. Our dataset is available at

Abstract: With the rise of online and virtual learning, monitoring and enhancing
student engagement have become an important aspect of effective education.
Traditional methods of assessing a student's involvement might not be
applicable directly to virtual environments. In this study, we focused on this
problem and addressed the need to develop an automated system to detect student
engagement levels during online learning. We proposed a novel training method
which can discourage a model from leveraging sensitive features like gender for
its predictions. The proposed method offers benefits not only in the
enforcement of ethical standards, but also to enhance interpretability of the
model predictions. We applied an attribute-orthogonal regularization technique
to a split-model classifier, which uses multiple transfer learning strategies
to achieve effective results in reducing disparity in the distribution of
prediction for sensitivity groups from a Pearson correlation coefficient of
0.897 for the unmitigated model, to 0.999 for the mitigated model. The source

Motivation: 图神经网络(GNNs)在图结构数据学习上具有高精度，但存在高计算和资源成本问题，需要研究神经网络压缩方法来减小模型大小同时保持合理精度。

Method: 使用三种剪枝方法和三种量化方法，在不同GNN模型上进行实验，包括图分类任务、节点分类任务和链接预测任务，在Cora、Proteins和BBBP三个图数据集上进行测试。

Conclusion: 剪枝方法能有效压缩GNN模型大小，而量化方法的效果因数据集而异，需要根据具体应用场景选择合适的压缩技术。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to operate with high accuracy on
learning from graph-structured data, but they suffer from high computational
and resource costs. Neural network compression methods are used to reduce the
model size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two of the common neural
network compression techniques include pruning and quantization. In this
research, we empirically examine the effects of three pruning methods and three
quantization methods on different GNN models, including graph classification
tasks, node classification tasks, and link prediction. We conducted all
experiments on three graph datasets, including Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. Our
findings demonstrate that unstructured fine-grained and global pruning can

TL;DR: 提出了Deep Gaussian Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM)方法，通过GP序列设计线性和非线性变换，解决函数空间映射问题，在预测性能和不确定性校准方面表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如函数线性模型和神经算子要么无法捕捉复杂非线性关系，要么在噪声、稀疏和不规则采样数据下缺乏可靠的不确定性量化。

Method: 设计基于GP的线性和非线性变换序列，利用核的积分变换、GP插值和从GP采样的非线性激活函数，通过诱导点和白化变换实现可扩展的概率推断。

Conclusion: DGPFM方法能够有效处理函数空间映射问题，在复杂非线性关系和不确定性量化方面表现优异。

Abstract: Learning mappings between functional spaces, also known as
function-on-function regression, plays a crucial role in functional data
analysis and has broad applications, e.g. spatiotemporal forecasting, curve
prediction, and climate modeling. Existing approaches, such as functional
linear models and neural operators, either fall short of capturing complex
nonlinearities or lack reliable uncertainty quantification under noisy, sparse,
and irregularly sampled data. To address these issues, we propose Deep Gaussian
Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM). Our method designs a sequence of
GP-based linear and nonlinear transformations, leveraging integral transforms
of kernels, GP interpolation, and nonlinear activations sampled from GPs. A key
insight simplifies implementation: under fixed locations, discrete
approximations of kernel integral transforms collapse into direct functional
integral transforms, enabling flexible incorporation of various integral
transform designs. To achieve scalable probabilistic inference, we use inducing
points and whitening transformations to develop a variational learning
algorithm. Empirical results on real-world and PDE benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the advantage of DGPFM in both predictive performance and
uncertainty calibration.

*Himadri S. Pandey,Kai Wang,Gian-Gabriel P. Garcia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于多动作RMABs的神经索引策略，通过神经网络学习臂-动作对的预算感知索引，并使用可微背包层进行约束优化，实现端到端的梯度训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典RMABs假设二元动作和单一全局预算，但在医疗等实际应用中，多个干预措施具有异构成本和约束，这些假设不再适用。

Method: 使用神经网络学习臂-动作对的索引，通过熵正则化最优传输问题构建可微背包层，将索引预测和约束优化统一在端到端可微框架中。

Result: NIP在异构预算严格约束下，实现了接近最优性能（与oracle策略相差5%以内），并能扩展到数百个臂。

Conclusion: 为复杂资源受限环境中的索引策略学习建立了一个通用、理论基础扎实且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) provide a scalable framework for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical formulations assume
binary actions and a single global budget. Real-world settings, such as
healthcare, often involve multiple interventions with heterogeneous costs and
constraints, where such assumptions break down. We introduce a Neural Index
Policy (NIP) for multi-action RMABs with heterogeneous budget constraints. Our
approach learns to assign budget-aware indices to arm--action pairs using a
neural network, and converts them into feasible allocations via a
differentiable knapsack layer formulated as an entropy-regularized optimal
transport (OT) problem. The resulting model unifies index prediction and
constrained optimization in a single end-to-end differentiable framework,
enabling gradient-based training directly on decision quality. The network is
optimized to align its induced occupancy measure with the theoretical upper
bound from a linear programming relaxation, bridging asymptotic RMAB theory
with practical learning. Empirically, NIP achieves near-optimal performance
within 5% of the oracle occupancy-measure policy while strictly enforcing
heterogeneous budgets and scaling to hundreds of arms. This work establishes a
general, theoretically grounded, and scalable framework for learning
index-based policies in complex resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成建模在表示学习中很强大，但在医学成像等挑战性领域直接应用有限：没有任务对齐的单纯生成无法为临床使用提供坚实基础。

Method: 构建为可逆和可微分双射的层次结构，其中雅可比行列式在子变换中分解，支持精确似然计算和稳定优化，通过条件类别标签实现可控样本合成和原则性类别概率估计。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估，MAGIC-Flow处理扫描仪噪声下的生成和分类，以及模态特定合成和识别，创建真实多样的样本并改进分类性能。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Flow是数据有限领域中生成和分类的有效策略，对隐私保护增强、鲁棒泛化和可信赖医疗AI具有直接益处。

Abstract: Generative modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation
learning, but its direct applicability to challenging fields like medical
imaging remains limited: mere generation, without task alignment, fails to
provide a robust foundation for clinical use. We propose MAGIC-Flow, a
conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation
and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a
hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian
determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures
exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility
enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an
interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels,
MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled
class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and
discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using
metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it
addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and
modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates
realistic, diverse samples and improves classification. MAGIC-Flow is an
effective strategy for generation and classification in data-limited domains,
with direct benefits for privacy-preserving augmentation, robust
generalization, and trustworthy medical AI.

Result: 从GPT-4.1轨迹蒸馏的SFT模型性能相当但模型小56倍，RL在匹配训练测试条件下带来7-20%绝对提升。"思考模式"实验表现持平或更差。

Conclusion: SFT和RL模型都无法跨环境泛化，强调匹配训练测试环境对于构建可靠真实世界代码修复代理的重要性。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real
repositories, where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation
unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix
build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning
dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced
a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL).
Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and
applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model
distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller,
and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions.
"Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models
failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of
matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing
agents.

Motivation: 传统固定分辨率方法无法捕捉多尺度物理过程，而现有HGNN在向下映射时会丢失全局趋势，削弱物理约束在预报中的整合。

Method: 设计潜在记忆保留机制保持全局趋势，建立潜在到物理分支集成多尺度PDE解场，使用预训练权重实现单轮收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了天气预报性能，还通过高效训练减少了碳足迹，对可持续AI发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by
global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure.
Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes
unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods
cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale
representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends,
weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast
and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a
multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a
Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward
traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields
across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead
times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability
for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a
single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such
efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges
sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in

Motivation: 传统的PBPK建模基于常微分方程，具有强烈的简化假设，限制了其对非线性生理相互作用的适应性。本研究旨在探索数据驱动的深度学习方法作为替代方案。

Method: 提出了动态图神经网络（Dynamic GNN），将器官间的生理连接建模为循环消息传递过程。同时实现了MLP和LSTM作为基线模型，分别捕捉分子和时间依赖性。

Result: Dynamic GNN在所有模型中表现最佳，R²为0.9342，RMSE为0.0159，MAE为0.0116。相比之下，MLP的R²为0.8705，LSTM的R²为0.8059。

Conclusion: 显式建模器官相互作用的时空依赖性能够实现更准确和可泛化的药物浓度预测。Dynamic GNN为传统PBPK公式提供了可扩展、无方程的替代方案，在临床前和临床研究中具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling plays a critical role
in drug development by predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs.
Traditional approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with strong
simplifying assumptions, which limit their adaptability to nonlinear
physiological interactions. In this study, we explore data-driven alternatives
for PBPK prediction using deep learning. Two baseline architectures - a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - are
implemented to capture molecular and temporal dependencies, respectively. To
incorporate inter-organ interactions, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network
(Dynamic GNN) that models physiological connections as recurrent
message-passing processes between organs. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed Dynamic GNN achieves the highest predictive performance among all
models, with an R^2 of 0.9342, an RMSE of 0.0159, and an MAE of 0.0116. In
comparison, the MLP baseline obtains an R^2 of 0.8705 and the LSTM achieves
0.8059. These results highlight that explicitly modeling the spatial and
temporal dependencies of organ interactions enables more accurate and
generalizable drug concentration prediction. The Dynamic GNN provides a
scalable, equation-free alternative to traditional PBPK formulations and
demonstrates strong potential for data-driven pharmacokinetic modeling in
preclinical and clinical research.

TL;DR: 提出了AniDS框架，一种用于3D分子去噪的各向异性变分自编码器，通过引入结构感知的各向异性噪声生成器来改进现有各向同性和同方差去噪方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪方法依赖简化的分子动力学假设，认为原子运动是各向同性和同方差的，这无法准确反映分子系统中真实的方向性和结构变异性。

Method: 设计了一个结构感知的各向异性噪声生成器，能够产生原子特定的全协方差矩阵，这些协方差来自原子间相互作用作为各向同性基础的各向异性修正，确保矩阵对称、半正定且具有SO(3)等变性。

Result: 在MD17和OC22基准测试中，AniDS优于先前的各向同性和同方差去噪模型及其他领先方法，在力预测精度上分别实现了8.9%和6.2%的平均相对改进。

Conclusion: AniDS能够自适应地抑制沿键合方向的噪声，与物理化学原理一致，为3D分子预训练提供了更准确的去噪框架。

Abstract: Coordinate denoising has emerged as a promising method for 3D molecular
pretraining due to its theoretical connection to learning molecular force
field. However, existing denoising methods rely on oversimplied molecular
dynamics that assume atomic motions to be isotropic and homoscedastic. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel denoising framework AniDS:
Anisotropic Variational Autoencoder for 3D Molecular Denoising. AniDS
introduces a structure-aware anisotropic noise generator that can produce
atom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions to
better reflect directional and structural variability in molecular systems.
These covariances are derived from pairwise atomic interactions as anisotropic
corrections to an isotropic base. Our design ensures that the resulting
covariance matrices are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and
SO(3)-equivariant, while providing greater capacity to model complex molecular
dynamics. Extensive experiments show that AniDS outperforms prior isotropic and
homoscedastic denoising models and other leading methods on the MD17 and OC22
benchmarks, achieving average relative improvements of 8.9% and 6.2% in force
prediction accuracy. Our case study on a crystal and molecule structure shows
that AniDS adaptively suppresses noise along the bonding direction, consistent
with physicochemical principles. Our code is available at

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to efficiently remove sensitive or harmful
memory from a pre-trained model. The key challenge is to balance the potential
tradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves
forgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's
original performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use
multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and
utility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only
guarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which
causes under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first
model MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the
unlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility
loss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to
unilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the
additional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an
implicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the
aforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,
thereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU. Theoretically, we provide a
tight convergence analysis of the algorithm. Empirically, our extensive
experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better tradeoff results
than existing baselines. Codes are available at

Motivation: 神经组合优化模型虽然性能优异，但其表示和决策原理仍是黑盒，这阻碍了学术研究和实际部署，需要更深入地理解NCO模型。

Method: 使用多种探测任务分析NCO模型表示，并引入创新的系数显著性探测(CS-Probing)工具，通过检查探测过程中的系数和统计显著性进行深度分析。

Result: 发现NCO模型编码了解决方案构建所需的低层次信息和促进更好决策的高层次知识；通过CS-Probing揭示了模型的不同归纳偏置、泛化能力的直接证据，以及特定知识相关的关键嵌入维度；通过少量代码修改改善了分析模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这是首次系统性地解释黑盒NCO模型的尝试，展示了探测作为分析其内部机制的有前景工具，为NCO社区提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has achieved remarkable performance,
yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black
box. This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since
researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this
paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by
investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we
introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing
(CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the
coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments
and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for
solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate
better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose
varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct
evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions
associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially
translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we
improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first
systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a
promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights
for the NCO community. The source code is publicly available.

Motivation: 传统Shapley值和交互指数计算需要枚举所有特征联盟，复杂度为O(2^n)，在大规模特征场景下计算不可行

Method: 将预测器的局部行为表示为因子化多线性映射，通过张量网络替代模型，用少量针对性评估提取k阶Shapley交互

Result: 在UCI数据集上，方法在保持精度的同时比KernelSHAP-IQ快25-1000倍，评估次数减少多个数量级

Conclusion: TN-SHAP为大规模特征交互分析提供了高效可行的解决方案，显著降低了计算复杂度

Abstract: We show how to replace the O(2^n) coalition enumeration over n features
behind Shapley values and Shapley-style interaction indices with a
few-evaluation scheme on a tensor-network (TN) surrogate: TN-SHAP. The key idea
is to represent a predictor's local behavior as a factorized multilinear map,
so that coalitional quantities become linear probes of a coefficient tensor.
TN-SHAP replaces exhaustive coalition sweeps with just a small number of
targeted evaluations to extract order-k Shapley interactions. In particular,
both order-1 (single-feature) and order-2 (pairwise) computations have cost
O(n*poly(chi) + n^2), where chi is the TN's maximal cut rank. We provide
theoretical guarantees on the approximation error and tractability of TN-SHAP.
On UCI datasets, our method matches enumeration on the fitted surrogate while
reducing evaluation by orders of magnitude and achieves 25-1000x wall-clock
speedups over KernelSHAP-IQ at comparable accuracy, while amortizing training
across local cohorts.

Conclusion: NMKE通过细粒度神经元级编辑，实现了更精确、更持久的终身知识更新

Abstract: Lifelong knowledge editing enables continuous, precise updates to outdated
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without computationally expensive
full retraining. However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout
the editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and
generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked
Knowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines
neuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron
functional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with
knowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and
knowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further
introduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to
the target knowledge. This strategy enables precise neuron-level knowledge
editing with fewer parameter modifications. Experimental results from thousands
of sequential edits demonstrate that NMKE outperforms existing methods in
maintaining high editing success rates and preserving model general
capabilities in lifelong editing.

Conclusion: 独裁者客户端构成了联邦学习中一种严重的安全威胁，需要在设计联邦学习系统时加以防范。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized
model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared
model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of
FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or
manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a
novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants
capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the
server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies
that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the
learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple
dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or
form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these
settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global
model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex
scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by
empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing
benchmarks.

Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling
interactions in large-scale multi-agent systems. Despite recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) for MFGs, existing methods are typically limited to
finite spaces or stationary models, hindering their applicability to real-world
problems. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm specifically designed for non-stationary continuous MFGs. The
proposed approach builds upon a Fictitious Play (FP) methodology, leveraging
DRL for best-response computation and supervised learning for average policy
representation. Furthermore, it learns a representation of the time-dependent
population distribution using a Conditional Normalizing Flow. To validate the
effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on three different examples of
increasing complexity. By addressing critical limitations in scalability and
density approximation, this work represents a significant advancement in
applying DRL techniques to complex MFG problems, bringing the field closer to
real-world multi-agent systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像深度学习等需要对图节点排列不变的场景中，基于排序的嵌入方法β_A具有重要作用。先前研究虽然证明了该映射在足够大的D下是单射且满足双Lipschitz条件，但仍存在两个关键问题：最优嵌入维度D未知，以及双Lipschitz常数的估计缺失。

Method: 通过构造特定的矩阵A，分析排序嵌入β_A的性质，包括单射性和双Lipschitz条件。研究了嵌入维度D的上下界，并分析了映射的失真度与维度n和d的关系。

Result: 改进了嵌入维度D的上界并给出了下界；证明了双Lipschitz失真与n的平方相关且完全独立于d；同时证明了失真度至少为Ω(√n)；提供了降维变体的类似结果。

Conclusion: 本文在基于排序的嵌入方法研究方面取得了重要进展，解决了嵌入维度优化和双Lipschitz常数估计两个关键问题，为图深度学习中的不变表示提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: We study the sorting-based embedding $\beta_{\mathbf A} : \mathbb R^{n \times
d} \to \mathbb R^{n \times D}$, $\mathbf X \mapsto {\downarrow}(\mathbf X
\mathbf A)$, where $\downarrow$ denotes column wise sorting of matrices. Such
embeddings arise in graph deep learning where outputs should be invariant to
permutations of graph nodes. Previous work showed that for large enough $D$ and
appropriate $\mathbf A$, the mapping $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is injective, and
moreover satisfies a bi-Lipschitz condition. However, two gaps remain: firstly,
the optimal size $D$ required for injectivity is not yet known, and secondly,
no estimates of the bi-Lipschitz constants of the mapping are known.
  In this paper, we make substantial progress in addressing both of these gaps.
Regarding the first gap, we improve upon the best known upper bounds for the
embedding dimension $D$ necessary for injectivity, and also provide a lower
bound on the minimal injectivity dimension. Regarding the second gap, we
construct matrices $\mathbf A$, so that the bi-Lipschitz distortion of
$\beta_{\mathbf A} $ depends quadratically on $n$, and is completely
independent of $d$. We also show that the distortion of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is
necessarily at least in $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we provide similar results
for variants of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ obtained by applying linear projections to
reduce the output dimension of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$.

TL;DR: 提出了一个任务特定的多数据集联合预训练框架，用于跨数据集情感识别，解决了数据集分布差异、情感类别定义不一致和个体间变异性等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用预训练EEG模型在复杂任务（如情感识别）中表现不佳，因为任务特定特征与广泛预训练方法不匹配。需要开发任务特定的预训练方法来处理跨数据集的情感识别挑战。

Method: 引入跨数据集协方差对齐损失来对齐数据集间的二阶统计特性；提出混合编码器，结合Mamba式线性注意力通道编码器和时空动态模型来捕捉EEG的长期依赖和复杂动态。

Result: 在少样本情感识别中AUROC平均提升4.57%，在新数据集零样本泛化中准确率提升11.92%。多数据集联合预训练比单数据集训练性能提升8.55%。

Conclusion: 为任务特定预训练提供了一个可扩展框架，并展示了其在可泛化情感计算中的优势。

Abstract: Task-specific pre-training is essential when task representations diverge
from generic pre-training features. Existing task-general pre-training EEG
models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches
between task-specific features and broad pre-training approaches. This work
aims to develop a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework for
cross-dataset emotion recognition, tackling problems of large inter-dataset
distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and substantial
inter-subject variability. We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment
loss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling
robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject
calibration. To capture the long-term dependency and complex dynamics of EEG,
we propose a hybrid encoder combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel
encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art large-scale EEG models by an average of 4.57% in AUROC for
few-shot emotion recognition and 11.92% in accuracy for zero-shot
generalization to a new dataset. Performance scales with the increase of
datasets used in pre-training. Multi-dataset joint pre-training achieves a
performance gain of 8.55% over single-dataset training. This work provides a
scalable framework for task-specific pre-training and highlights its benefit in
generalizable affective computing. Our code is available at

TL;DR: EPC是一种有损文本压缩方法，利用掩码语言模型作为解压缩器，通过存储基于排名的修正来实现连续率失真控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在有损压缩领域的应用，在重建保真度和压缩比之间进行权衡。

Method: 使用掩码语言模型预测被掩码内容，仅当模型预测错误时存储最小化的基于排名的修正，创建残差通道实现连续率失真控制。

Result: EPC在精确比特计算和率失真分析中始终优于预测掩码基线，以显著更低的比特率提供更优的保真度。

Conclusion: EPC通过更有效地利用模型内在知识，在有损文本压缩中实现了优越的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve near-optimal lossless compression by
acting as powerful probability models. We investigate their use in the lossy
domain, where reconstruction fidelity is traded for higher compression ratios.
This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text codec
that leverages a Masked Language Model (MLM) as a decompressor. Instead of
storing a subset of original tokens, EPC allows the model to predict masked
content and stores minimal, rank-based corrections only when the model's top
prediction is incorrect. This creates a residual channel that offers continuous
rate-distortion control. We compare EPC to a simpler Predictive Masking (PM)
baseline and a transform-based Vector Quantisation with a Residual Patch
(VQ+RE) approach. Through an evaluation that includes precise bit accounting
and rate-distortion analysis, we demonstrate that EPC consistently dominates
PM, offering superior fidelity at a significantly lower bit rate by more
efficiently utilising the model's intrinsic knowledge.

Motivation: 预训练模型在不同设计选择下表现出不同的泛化行为，各自掌握独特的数据洞察。利用公开模型库作为辅助改进源，通过知识迁移提升模型性能。

Method: 设计数据分区策略，让预训练模型自主选择扮演学生（寻求知识）或教师（传授知识）角色，支持双向、跨架构和多模型间的知识迁移。

Result: 在图像分类中ViT-B性能提升约1.4%；语义分割中所有评估指标均有提升；视频显著性预测达到新的SOTA；多模型知识迁移使所有参与模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的知识迁移方法能有效利用模型库资源，在不同任务中实现性能改进，证明了预训练模型间知识共享的价值。

Abstract: Pretrained models are ubiquitous in the current deep learning landscape,
offering strong results on a broad range of tasks. Recent works have shown that
models differing in various design choices exhibit categorically diverse
generalization behavior, resulting in one model grasping distinct data-specific
insights unavailable to the other. In this paper, we propose to leverage large
publicly available model repositories as an auxiliary source of model
improvements. We introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models
autonomously adopt either the role of a student, seeking knowledge, or that of
a teacher, imparting knowledge. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In image classification, we
improved the performance of ViT-B by approximately 1.4% through bidirectional
knowledge transfer with ViT-T. For semantic segmentation, our method boosted
all evaluation metrics by enabling knowledge transfer both within and across
backbone architectures. In video saliency prediction, our approach achieved a
new state-of-the-art. We further extend our approach to knowledge transfer
between multiple models, leading to considerable performance improvements for
all model participants.

Motivation: 在算法决策中，公平机器学习方法通常产生多个平衡预测公平性和性能的模型，这给需要根据特定需求选择合适模型的相关方带来了挑战。

Method: 使用弱监督度量学习学习反映公平性和性能相似性的Mahalanobis距离，然后应用k-means聚类对模型的特征重要性表示进行分组。

Result: 框架能够根据相关方相关标准结构化模型的特征重要性空间，帮助用户探索具有相似预测行为和公平性特征的模型集群。

Conclusion: 该交互式框架通过帮助用户理解模型在公平性-性能平衡以及驱动预测的特征方面的差异，促进明智的决策制定。

Abstract: In the context of algorithmic decision-making, fair machine learning methods
often yield multiple models that balance predictive fairness and performance in
varying degrees. This diversity introduces a challenge for stakeholders who
must select a model that aligns with their specific requirements and values. To
address this, we propose an interactive framework that assists in navigating
and interpreting the trade-offs across a portfolio of models. Our approach
leverages weakly supervised metric learning to learn a Mahalanobis distance
that reflects similarity in fairness and performance outcomes, effectively
structuring the feature importance space of the models according to
stakeholder-relevant criteria. We then apply clustering technique (k-means) to
group models based on their transformed representations of feature importances,
allowing users to explore clusters of models with similar predictive behaviors
and fairness characteristics. This facilitates informed decision-making by
helping users understand how models differ not only in their
fairness-performance balance but also in the features that drive their
predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 层剪枝会严重损害LLMs的长链推理能力，即使只剪枝1-2层也会破坏测试时缩放机制，导致长推理基准性能崩溃，而标准微调无法恢复这种能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有层剪枝方法在通用知识任务上表现良好，但对长链推理这种更脆弱但关键能力的影响尚未被充分研究，特别是对测试时缩放机制的影响。

Method: 通过测试时缩放的视角研究层剪枝对长链推理的影响，进行广泛实验分析剪枝对推理能力的破坏机制。

Result: 剪枝即使1-2层也会严重损害测试时缩放，长推理基准性能急剧下降，而知识密集和浅层推理任务性能保持稳定，标准微调无法恢复受损的测试时缩放能力。

Conclusion: 层剪枝对推理密集型LLMs存在根本性风险，需要重新思考层剪枝策略，开发能保持推理鲁棒性的方法。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a widely adopted technique for improving the
efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods
demonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their
effect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on
long-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in
modern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more
computation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
pruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with
performance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when
performance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.
Furthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to
recover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,
we identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and
highlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to
reasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning
strategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the
robustness of reasoning. We open-source the codebase in

TL;DR: LUNA是一个自监督基础模型，通过将多通道EEG压缩到固定大小的拓扑无关潜在空间，解决了EEG数据中电极布局异构性的问题，实现了线性计算复杂度扩展，并在多个下游任务中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG数据中电极布局异构性导致的模型泛化问题，传统方法计算复杂度随通道数呈二次增长，限制了大规模EEG模型的构建。

Method: 使用学习查询和交叉注意力将多通道EEG压缩到固定大小的拓扑无关潜在空间，下游transformer块仅在此潜在表示上使用补丁式时间自注意力操作，实现计算与电极数量的解耦。

Result: 在TUAR和TUSL基准测试中达到最先进水平（如TUAR上0.921 AUROC），计算量减少300倍，GPU内存使用最多减少10倍，这些优势在所有评估的电极配置中保持一致。

Conclusion: LUNA通过统一的潜在表示有效解决了EEG拓扑异构性问题，实现了高效的线性扩展，为大规模EEG建模提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive lens into human brain
activity, but building large-scale models is hampered by topological
heterogeneity: each public EEG data defines its own electrode layout, limiting
generalization. We introduce LUNA (Latent Unified Network Architecture), a
self-supervised foundation model that reconciles disparate electrode geometries
while scaling linearly -- not quadratically -- with channel count. LUNA
compresses multi-channel EEG into a fixed-size, topology-agnostic latent space
via learned queries and cross-attention. Downstream transformer blocks then
operate exclusively on this latent representation using patch-wise temporal
self-attention, decoupling computation from electrode count. Pre-trained on
TUEG and Siena (over 21,000 hours of raw EEG across diverse montages) using a
masked-patch reconstruction objective, LUNA transfers effectively to four
downstream tasks: abnormality detection, artifact rejection, slowing
classification, and emotion recognition. It demonstrates highly competitive
performance across several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on
TUAR and TUSL, e.g., 0.921 AUROC on TUAR, while reducing FLOPs by 300x and
trimming GPU memory use by up to 10x. Critically, these gains are consistent
across all evaluated electrode configurations. Code is available at

<details>

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable successes, yet its deployment in
safety-critical domains remains hindered by an inherent inability to manage
uncertainty, resulting in overconfident and unreliable predictions when models
encounter out-of-distribution data, adversarial perturbations, or naturally
fluctuating environments. This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling
Machine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these
critical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial
Intelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the
uncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as
opposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby
empowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from
overconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.
  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network
(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief
functions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty
through the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including
its adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather
classification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a
unified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive
experiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning
not only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also
lays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the
ability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and
dependable systems. The title encapsulates the core philosophy of this work,
emphasizing that true intelligence involves recognizing and managing the limits
of one's own knowledge.

Conclusion: 学业表现是一个系统性现象，与学校生态系统密切相关。研究提供了数据驱动的可解释工具，有助于制定促进教育公平的政策。

Abstract: Identifying the factors that influence student performance in basic education
is a central challenge for formulating effective public policies in Brazil.
This study introduces a multi-level machine learning approach to classify the
proficiency of 9th-grade and high school students using microdata from the
System of Assessment of Basic Education (SAEB). Our model uniquely integrates
four data sources: student socioeconomic characteristics, teacher professional
profiles, school indicators, and director management profiles. A comparative
analysis of four ensemble algorithms confirmed the superiority of a Random
Forest model, which achieved 90.2% accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC)
of 96.7%. To move beyond prediction, we applied Explainable AI (XAI) using
SHAP, which revealed that the school's average socioeconomic level is the most
dominant predictor, demonstrating that systemic factors have a greater impact
than individual characteristics in isolation. The primary conclusion is that
academic performance is a systemic phenomenon deeply tied to the school's
ecosystem. This study provides a data-driven, interpretable tool to inform
policies aimed at promoting educational equity by addressing disparities
between schools.

Abstract: The growing instability of both global and domestic economic environments has
increased the risk of financial distress at the household level. However,
traditional econometric models often rely on delayed and aggregated data,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a machine learning-based
early warning system that utilizes real-time digital and macroeconomic signals
to identify financial distress in near real-time. Using a panel dataset of 750
households tracked over three monitoring rounds spanning 13 months, the
framework combines socioeconomic attributes, macroeconomic indicators (such as
GDP growth, inflation, and foreign exchange fluctuations), and digital economy
measures (including ICT demand and market volatility). Through data
preprocessing and feature engineering, we introduce lagged variables,
volatility measures, and interaction terms to capture both gradual and sudden
changes in financial stability. We benchmark baseline classifiers, such as
logistic regression and decision trees, against advanced ensemble models
including random forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Our results indicate that the
engineered features from the digital economy significantly enhance predictive
accuracy. The system performs reliably for both binary distress detection and
multi-class severity classification, with SHAP-based explanations identifying
inflation volatility and ICT demand as key predictors. Crucially, the framework
is designed for scalable deployment in national agencies and low-bandwidth
regional offices, ensuring it is accessible for policymakers and practitioners.
By implementing machine learning in a transparent and interpretable manner,
this study demonstrates the feasibility and impact of providing near-real-time
early warnings of financial distress. This offers actionable insights that can
strengthen household resilience and guide preemptive intervention strategies.

Motivation: 现实世界中的测试图常存在数据质量问题和分布偏移，这会显著降低预训练模型的鲁棒性和测试性能。研究发现通过调整测试图结构可以显著改善模型表现。

Method: 开发同配性预测器来区分测试边，根据预测的同配性分数置信度自适应地进行测试时图结构转换。

Conclusion: 基于同配性的测试时图结构转换方法能有效提升预训练GNN模型在节点分类任务中的鲁棒性和性能，且无需模型训练或更新。

Abstract: Homophily, the tendency of nodes from the same class to connect, is a
fundamental property of real-world graphs, underpinning structural and semantic
patterns in domains such as citation networks and social networks. Existing
methods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures
or graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN
learning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs
often suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain
shifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal
evolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time
periods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's
robustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical
observations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test
graph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it
in heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance
of pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training
or update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural
transformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.
Specifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,
facilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the
confidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine
benchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate
that GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 10.92%. Our code has been released at

Conclusion: MASER预测模型在MASLD预测中实现了竞争性性能，与先前报道的集成和基于树的模型相当。这种方法表明可解释模型可以在多样化患者群体中实现预测性能和公平性的平衡。

Abstract: Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)
affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease.
Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection
is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We
developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and
compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.
  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and
a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including
the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates
across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity
postprocessing method.
  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in
the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic
regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability
and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved
AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and
F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly
increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and
F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.
  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk
Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive
performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to
previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach
demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive
performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.

Abstract: Timely access to laboratory values is critical for clinical decision-making,
yet current approaches rely on invasive venous sampling and are intrinsically
delayed. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a non-invasive and widely available
signal, offers a promising modality for rapid laboratory estimation. Recent
progress in deep learning has enabled the extraction of latent hematological
signatures from ECGs. However, existing models are constrained by low
signal-to-noise ratios, substantial inter-individual variability, limited data
diversity, and suboptimal generalization, especially when adapted to low-lead
wearable devices. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study leveraging
transfer learning to fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pre-trained ECG
foundation model, on the Multimodal Clinical Monitoring in the Emergency
Department (MC-MED) dataset from Stanford. We generated a corpus of more than
20 million standardized ten-second ECG segments to enhance sensitivity to
subtle biochemical correlates. On internal validation, the model demonstrated
strong predictive performance (area under the curve above 0.65) for
thirty-three laboratory indicators, moderate performance (between 0.55 and
0.65) for fifty-nine indicators, and limited performance (below 0.55) for
sixteen indicators. This study provides an efficient artificial-intelligence
driven solution and establishes the feasibility scope for real-time,
non-invasive estimation of laboratory values.

for analogical reasoning in science. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can
generate novel battery materials by (1) retrieving cross-domain analogs and
analogy-guided exemplars to steer exploration beyond conventional dopant
substitutions, and (2) constructing in-domain analogical templates from few
labeled examples to guide targeted exploitation. These explicit analogical
reasoning strategies yield candidates outside established compositional spaces
and outperform standard prompting baselines. Our findings position LLMs as
interpretable, expert-like hypothesis generators that leverage analogy-driven
generalization for scientific innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决节点状态跟踪中查询成本与预测准确性之间的权衡问题，传统方法难以同时优化查询决策和预测精度。

Method: 采用贪心策略，当预测损失低于查询成本时预测，否则查询；在马尔可夫设置下分析性能；对未知转移概率情况提出基于投影随机梯度下降的学习变体。

Result: 贪心策略在一般情况下是次优的且竞争比无界，但在相同分布转移概率条件下接近最优；学习变体在预测-查询权衡中表现良好且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 贪心策略在特定条件下是有效的近似方法，提出的学习变体在未知转移概率情况下能实现更好的性能权衡和计算效率。

Abstract: We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The
monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed
cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using
time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models
(TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query
decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is
nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the
expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We
analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is
a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query
cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is
suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common
conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it
performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we
further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning
variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff
with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.

*Mengyu Ye,Jun Suzuki,Tatsuro Inaba,Tatsuki Kuribayashi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究重新评估了前馈层特征向量与稀疏自编码器学习特征的对比，发现两者在可解释性方面表现相似，甚至在某些方面前馈层特征表现更好，对SAEs的优势提出了质疑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM可解释性研究主要关注通过代理模块（如稀疏自编码器）发现特征，但缺乏与原模型参数特征的系统性比较，需要验证这些学习特征是否真的比原始参数特征具有更好特性。

Method: 从FF层作为键值存储的视角重新审视其可解释性，使用现代可解释性基准对FF层特征向量和SAE学习特征进行广泛评估比较。

Result: SAE和FF层在可解释性范围上相似，SAE在某些方面有轻微改进，但令人惊讶的是在某些方面普通FF层甚至比SAE具有更好的可解释性，且两者发现的特征存在分歧。

Conclusion: 对SAE在特征质量和忠实性方面的优势提出质疑，建议FF层键值参数应作为现代可解释性研究的强基线。

Abstract: Recent interpretability work on large language models (LLMs) has been
increasingly dominated by a feature-discovery approach with the help of proxy
modules. Then, the quality of features learned by, e.g., sparse auto-encoders
(SAEs), is evaluated. This paradigm naturally raises a critical question: do
such learned features have better properties than those already represented
within the original model parameters, and unfortunately, only a few studies
have made such comparisons systematically so far. In this work, we revisit the
interpretability of feature vectors stored in feed-forward (FF) layers, given
the perspective of FF as key-value memories, with modern interpretability
benchmarks. Our extensive evaluation revealed that SAE and FFs exhibits a
similar range of interpretability, although SAEs displayed an observable but
minimal improvement in some aspects. Furthermore, in certain aspects,
surprisingly, even vanilla FFs yielded better interpretability than the SAEs,
and features discovered in SAEs and FFs diverged. These bring questions about
the advantage of SAEs from both perspectives of feature quality and
faithfulness, compared to directly interpreting FF feature vectors, and FF
key-value parameters serve as a strong baseline in modern interpretability
research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种四步部分贝叶斯框架，用于本构模型发现中的不确定性量化，无需材料参数先验选择，可发现非线性本构模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要材料参数先验选择、仅限于模型库的线性系数或推断参数概率分布灵活性不足，因此需要一种更灵活的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 四步框架：1) 用高斯过程增强应力-变形数据；2) 用归一化流近似参数分布；3) 通过匹配参数诱导的应力-变形函数分布与高斯过程后验来精炼参数分布；4) 进行Sobol敏感性分析获得稀疏可解释模型。

Result: 该框架在各项同性和各向异性实验数据以及线性和非线性模型库中均表现出良好能力。

Conclusion: 提出的四步部分贝叶斯框架有效解决了本构模型发现中的不确定性量化问题，无需先验选择且支持非线性模型发现。

Abstract: Constitutive model discovery refers to the task of identifying an appropriate
model structure, usually from a predefined model library, while simultaneously
inferring its material parameters. The data used for model discovery are
measured in mechanical tests and are thus inevitably affected by noise which,
in turn, induces uncertainties. Previously proposed methods for uncertainty
quantification in model discovery either require the selection of a prior for
the material parameters, are restricted to the linear coefficients of the model
library or are limited in the flexibility of the inferred parameter probability
distribution. We therefore propose a four-step partially Bayesian framework for
uncertainty quantification in model discovery that does not require prior
selection for the material parameters and also allows for the discovery of
non-linear constitutive models: First, we augment the available
stress-deformation data with a Gaussian process. Second, we approximate the
parameter distribution by a normalizing flow, which allows for capturing
complex joint distributions. Third, we distill the parameter distribution by
matching the distribution of stress-deformation functions induced by the
parameters with the Gaussian process posterior. Fourth, we perform a Sobol'
sensitivity analysis to obtain a sparse and interpretable model. We demonstrate
the capability of our framework for both isotropic and anisotropic experimental
data as well as linear and non-linear model libraries.

TL;DR: 提出了Concept Walk框架，通过激活空间中的概念方向投影来追踪模型内部立场在推理过程中的演变，以区分装饰性推理和忠实推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的思维链追踪不能忠实反映语言模型的内部计算，可能导致从业者误将装饰性推理视为真实推理，需要新的监督方法。

Method: Concept Walk框架在激活空间中操作，将每个推理步骤投影到从对比数据学习的概念方向上，观察推理痕迹是否影响结果或被丢弃。

Result: 在Qwen 3-4B安全领域案例研究中发现，'简单'情况下被扰乱的思维链会被快速忽略（装饰性推理），而'困难'情况下扰动会持续改变内部激活（忠实推理）。

Conclusion: Concept Walk提供了通过概念特定内部动态重新检验忠实性的方法，帮助识别何时可以信任推理痕迹，何时可能误导从业者。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language
models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of
internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may
misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a
general framework for tracing how a model's internal stance evolves with
respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept
Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the
concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe
whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we
apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in
'easy' cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative
reasoning, whereas in 'hard' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in
internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is
methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through
concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can
be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly adopted in high-stakes
decision-making domains, ensuring fairness in their outputs has become a
central challenge. At the core of fair ML research are the datasets used to
investigate bias and develop mitigation strategies. Yet, much of the existing
work relies on a narrow selection of datasets--often arbitrarily chosen,
inconsistently processed, and lacking in diversity--undermining the
generalizability and reproducibility of results.
  To address these limitations, we present FairGround: a unified framework,
data corpus, and Python package aimed at advancing reproducible research and
critical data studies in fair ML classification. FairGround currently comprises
44 tabular datasets, each annotated with rich fairness-relevant metadata. Our
accompanying Python package standardizes dataset loading, preprocessing,
transformation, and splitting, streamlining experimental workflows. By
providing a diverse and well-documented dataset corpus along with robust
tooling, FairGround enables the development of fairer, more reliable, and more
reproducible ML models. All resources are publicly available to support open

TL;DR: 提出平滑梯度上升(SGA)方法来解决LLM遗忘中的梯度上升(GA)方法不稳定性问题，通过在遗忘数据与构造的正常数据之间进行可调平滑率的学习，实现更稳定的遗忘同时更好保持模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM遗忘旨在以低成本让模型忘记危险/不需要的知识，同时尽可能保持模型效用。现有梯度上升(GA)方法存在严重不稳定性，导致模型效用大幅下降。

Method: 提出平滑梯度上升(SGA)，将遗忘数据与多个构造的正常数据通过可调平滑率结合，从仅在遗忘数据上学习扩展到在遗忘和正常数据上联合学习。理论上提供了最优平滑率选择指导。

Result: 在TOFU、Harry Potter和MUSE-NEWS三个基准测试上评估，SGA在所有指标上持续优于原始GA方法，并在多个关键指标上达到所有基线方法的前2名性能。

Conclusion: SGA通过平滑梯度上升机制有效解决了GA的不稳定性问题，实现了更稳定的LLM遗忘同时更好保持模型效用。

Abstract: LLM unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models
to forget hazardous/undesired knowledge at low cost while preserving as much
model utility as possible. Among existing techniques, the most straightforward
method is performing Gradient Ascent (GA) w.r.t. the forget data, thereby
forcing the model to unlearn the forget dataset. However, GA suffers from
severe instability, as it drives updates in a divergent direction, often
resulting in drastically degraded model utility. To address this issue, we
propose Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA). SGA combines the forget data with
multiple constructed normal data through a tunable smoothing rate. Intuitively,
this extends GA from learning solely on the forget data to jointly learning
across both forget and normal data, enabling more stable unlearning while
better preserving model utility. Theoretically, we provide the theoretical
guidance on the selection of the optimal smoothing rate. Empirically, we
evaluate SGA on three benchmarks: TOFU, Harry Potter, and MUSE-NEWS.
Experimental results demonstrate that SGA consistently outperforms the original
Gradient Ascent (GA) method across all metrics and achieves top-2 performance
among all baseline methods on several key metrics.

TL;DR: 提出用康威生命游戏替代dropout进行正则化，通过动态单元失活和空间模式演化来提升神经网络泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统dropout存在静态性和缺乏可解释性的局限，需要更动态、自适应的正则化方法。

Method: 将神经网络单元表示为生命游戏网格中的细胞，应用游戏规则动态失活单元，形成自适应训练数据的空间模式。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，该方法与传统dropout性能相当，同时通过可视化演化模式提供网络行为洞察。

Conclusion: 生命游戏正则化在深层架构中增强不同dropout技术的性能，提供动态且可解释的正则化方案。

Abstract: Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and
improving the generalization performance of neural networks. Dropout, a widely
used regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to
introduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its
effectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of
interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization
by substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata
with simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce
dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units
as cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units. This
approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the
training data, potentially enhancing the network's ability to generalize. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing
that dynamic unit deactivation using GoL achieves comparable performance to
traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the network's
behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns. Furthermore, our
discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper
architectures, demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different
dropout techniques.

Method: 提出增强式回放持续学习框架，利用外部知识库进行数据增强，克服缓冲区大小限制，在回放过程中整合额外知识。

Result: 在三个异常行为分类数据集上的评估表明，增强方法优于基线回放式方法，能更好地维持模型性能。

Conclusion: 通过外部知识增强的回放式持续学习能有效应对数据漂移和灾难性遗忘，提升模型在动态环境中的适应性。

Abstract: User behavior on online platforms is evolving, reflecting real-world changes
in how people post, whether it's helpful messages or hate speech. Models that
learn to capture this content can experience a decrease in performance over
time due to data drift, which can lead to ineffective behavioral analytics
systems. However, fine-tuning such a model over time with new data can be
detrimental due to catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based approaches in
continual learning offer a simple yet efficient method to update such models,
minimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances
from past learned tasks. However, the main limitation of this approach is the
fixed size of the buffer. External knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome
this limitation through data augmentation. We propose a novel
augmentation-based approach to incorporate external knowledge in the
replay-based continual learning framework. We evaluate several strategies with
three datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to
assess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and
demonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replay-based
approaches.

Motivation: 研究在流式设置下使用有限精度进行PCA估计的问题，探索在量化约束下如何有效估计主成分，并建立理论性能界限。

Method: 使用Oja算法进行流式PCA，在线性和非线性随机量化方案下对权重向量和更新进行无偏随机量化，采用批处理版本进行分析。

Result: 在数据分布的温和矩和谱间隙假设下，批处理版本在线性和非线性量化方案下都能达到信息论下界（最多相差对数因子），非线性量化设置下实现了几乎与维度无关的量化误差。

Conclusion: 低精度流式PCA方法在理论上接近最优性能，实验验证了这些方法能够紧密跟踪标准Oja算法的性能，为有限精度环境下的PCA估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-precision streaming PCA estimates the top principal component in a
streaming setting under limited precision. We establish an
information-theoretic lower bound on the quantization resolution required to
achieve a target accuracy for the leading eigenvector. We study Oja's algorithm
for streaming PCA under linear and nonlinear stochastic quantization. The
quantized variants use unbiased stochastic quantization of the weight vector
and the updates. Under mild moment and spectral-gap assumptions on the data
distribution, we show that a batched version achieves the lower bound up to
logarithmic factors under both schemes. This leads to a nearly dimension-free
quantization error in the nonlinear quantization setting. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic streams validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our
low-precision methods closely track the performance of standard Oja's
algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数神经网络架构仍使用固定、统一的激活函数，但不同神经元可能需要不同的激活函数来优化性能。

Method: 第一阶段：神经元通过可微分硬混合机制从候选激活函数池（ReLU、Sigmoid、Tanh、Leaky ReLU、ELU、SELU）中自适应选择；第二阶段：根据学习到的选择固定每个神经元的激活函数，形成计算高效的网络。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上的评估显示，不同层中的神经元对激活函数表现出不同的偏好，揭示了神经网络架构中的功能多样性。

Conclusion: SmartMixed策略能够有效学习每个神经元的最优激活函数，同时保持推理效率，为神经网络激活函数选择提供了新的思路。

Abstract: The choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks,
yet most architectures still rely on fixed, uniform activation functions across
all neurons. We introduce SmartMixed, a two-phase training strategy that allows
networks to learn optimal per-neuron activation functions while preserving
computational efficiency at inference. In the first phase, neurons adaptively
select from a pool of candidate activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh,
Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) using a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the
second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed according to the
learned selection, resulting in a computationally efficient network that
supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations. We evaluate
SmartMixed on the MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying
depths. The analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct
preferences for activation functions, providing insights into the functional
diversity within neural architectures.

Conclusion: GraphTOP是首个有效探索图拓扑提示的框架，能够显著提升预训练GNN模型在下游任务中的适配性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph learning
by learning expressive graph representations from massive graph data. As a
common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme
first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an
effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while
keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting
studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to
node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve
suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of
*topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the
graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph
prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph**
**T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively
adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we
reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within
multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space
through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph
sparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training
strategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on
multiple node classification datasets. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GradLite是一种内存高效的优化器，通过放松对精确梯度的要求，在激进丢弃或近似中间激活时仍能高效训练，减少内存消耗达50%且性能不降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器如SGD或Adam需要精确梯度，导致LLM全参数微调时内存消耗巨大。现有解决方案要么改变模型架构，要么以计算换内存，但优化器本身未被触及。

Method: 采用两种关键技术：(1)低秩Jacobian近似，降低反向传播误差信号的维度；(2)误差反馈校正，在迭代中累积并补偿近似误差以保持收敛保证。

Result: 理论分析表明GradLite保持无偏梯度估计和有界方差，收敛速度与Adam相当。实证显示减少优化器状态和激活内存消耗达50%，在推理、多语言和对话基准测试中性能相当或优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GradLite提供了一种无需架构修改的内存高效优化方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低内存需求。

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is notoriously
memory-intensive, primarily because conventional optimizers such as SGD or Adam
assume access to exact gradients derived from cached activations. Existing
solutions either alter the model architecture (e.g., reversible networks) or
trade memory for computation (e.g., activation checkpointing), but the
optimizer itself remains untouched. In this work, we introduce GradLite, a
backward-friendly optimizer that relaxes the requirement of exact gradients,
enabling efficient training even when intermediate activations are aggressively
discarded or approximated. GradLite leverages two key techniques: (i) low-rank
Jacobian approximation, which reduces the dimensionality of backpropagated
error signals, and (ii) error-feedback correction, which accumulates and
compensates approximation errors across iterations to preserve convergence
guarantees. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that GradLite maintains
unbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance, ensuring convergence rates
comparable to Adam. Empirically, GradLite reduces optimizer-state and
activation memory consumption by up to 50\% without architectural changes, and
achieves on-par or superior downstream performance on reasoning (MMLU, GSM8K),
multilingual, and dialogue benchmarks compared to checkpointing and
optimizer-centric baselines (LoMo, GaLore).

Conclusion: CORGII是第一个使用离散标记映射到高效倒排列表的密集图表示索引器，为图检索任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving graphs from a large corpus, that contain a subgraph isomorphic to
a given query graph, is a core operation in many real-world applications. While
recent multi-vector graph representations and scores based on set alignment and
containment can provide accurate subgraph isomorphism tests, their use in
retrieval remains limited by their need to score corpus graphs exhaustively. We
introduce CORGII (Contextual Representation of Graphs for Inverted Indexing), a
graph indexing framework in which, starting with a contextual dense graph
representation, a differentiable discretization module computes sparse binary
codes over a learned latent vocabulary. This text document-like representation
allows us to leverage classic, highly optimized inverted indices, while
supporting soft (vector) set containment scores. Pushing this paradigm further,
we replace the classical, fixed impact weight of a `token' on a graph (such as
TFIDF or BM25) with a data-driven, trainable impact weight. Finally, we explore
token expansion to support multi-probing the index for smoother
accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. To our knowledge, CORGII is the first indexer of
dense graph representations using discrete tokens mapping to efficient inverted
lists. Extensive experiments show that CORGII provides better trade-offs
between accuracy and efficiency, compared to several baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量训练数据，在可控性和泛化性方面存在局限，需要开发更高效可控的3D生成方法。

Conclusion: LAMP推进了可控、数据高效且安全的3D生成，适用于设计探索、数据集生成和性能驱动优化。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D geometries that satisfy specific parameter
constraints has broad applications in design and engineering. However, current
methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with
controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of
Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and
interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF)
decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then
synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in
the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety
metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP
on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that
LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100
samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond
training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed

### [307] [Scalable Oversight via Partitioned Human Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22500)
*Ren Yin,Takashi Ishida,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个可扩展的监督框架，利用人类专家的互补标签（指出错误选项）来评估和训练超越人类能力的AI系统，无需真实标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在多个领域超越人类专家，获取高质量的人类监督变得困难。人类专家只能在其狭窄领域提供弱信号（互补标签），但无法评估超级任务的正确性。

Method: 从互补标签推导出无偏的top-1准确率估计器，量化需要多少互补标签才能匹配普通标签的方差。引入两种估计器来结合稀缺的普通标签和丰富的互补标签，并提供有限样本偏差保证。

Result: 实验表明，使用互补标签可以在没有真实标签的情况下评估大语言模型的输出，并且可以训练AI系统在这种弱信号下表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过人类分区监督的可扩展监督框架能够有效评估前沿AI系统，并利用互补标签训练AI系统，解决了超级任务中人类监督的挑战。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human
performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human
supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our
focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains.
Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single
narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI
systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise,
humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an
option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is
not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease.
Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that
enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the
ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from
complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to
match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to
combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide
finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed
estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large
language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We
further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how
we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with
this partitioned human supervision. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLEMA是一个结合大型语言模型科学知识与化学进化规则的材料设计框架，通过多目标优化在14个实际任务中实现了比生成式和纯LLM基线更高的命中率和帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料发现需要在广阔的化学和结构空间中导航，同时满足多个通常冲突的目标。现有方法难以有效平衡这些复杂约束。

Method: LLEMA框架将LLM的科学知识与化学进化规则和基于记忆的细化相结合：LLM在明确属性约束下提出候选材料，代理增强的oracle估计物理化学性质，多目标评分器更新成功/失败记忆来指导后续生成。

Result: 在电子、能源、涂层、光学和航空航天等14个现实任务中，LLEMA发现了化学上合理、热力学稳定且属性对齐的候选材料，实现了比生成式和纯LLM基线更高的命中率和更强的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: 通过强制执行可合成性和多目标权衡，LLEMA为加速实际材料发现提供了一条原则性路径，消融研究证实了规则引导生成、基于记忆的细化和代理预测的重要性。

Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces
while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided
Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the
scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed
evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM
proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property
constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;
and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide
subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics,
energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are
chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving
higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only
baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation,
memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing
synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled
pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

TL;DR: 本文分析了连续扩散在离散数据上表现不佳的原因，提出了token可识别性框架，揭示了离散身份腐蚀和连续秩退化两种机制的时间不协调问题，并提出了CANDI混合框架来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解为什么连续扩散在连续域（如图像生成）表现出色，但在离散数据上却不如纯离散方法，这种差距与直觉相悖，因为连续扩散学习到的评分函数能够实现多个位置的联合演化。

Method: 提出了CANDI（连续和离散扩散）混合框架，将离散和连续腐蚀解耦，同时学习条件结构和连续几何。通过token可识别性框架分析高斯噪声如何通过离散身份腐蚀和连续秩退化两种机制破坏离散数据。

Result: 实证验证了时间不协调现象，并证明CANDI成功避免了这一问题。在受控生成任务中，CANDI通过简单梯度加法实现了基于分类器的引导；在文本生成任务中，CANDI在低NFE下优于掩码扩散，证明了学习连续梯度对离散空间的价值。

Conclusion: CANDI框架解锁了连续扩散在离散空间中的优势，解决了离散和连续机制之间的时间不协调问题，为离散数据上的连续扩散方法提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains
such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has
underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is
counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that
enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we
introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding
how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete
identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these
mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal
dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough
structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise
levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys
nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous
ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and
continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional
structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal
dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This
unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled
generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf
classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI
outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning
continuous gradients for discrete spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL)算法，一种基于分治范式的值学习算法，专门用于离线目标条件强化学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线目标条件强化学习中传统方法（如TD方法和蒙特卡洛方法）存在的偏差累积和高方差问题，特别是在处理长轨迹时。

Method: 将GCRL中的三角不等式结构转化为实用的分治值更新规则，通过分治策略减少递归次数（O(log T) vs O(T)），同时利用动态编程降低方差。

Result: 在极具挑战性的长视野基准任务中，TRL相比之前的离线GCRL算法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: TRL通过分治范式有效解决了传统值学习方法在离线GCRL中的局限性，为长轨迹问题提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we present Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL), a new value
learning algorithm based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm. TRL is designed for
offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) problems, where the aim
is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the
smallest number of steps. TRL converts a triangle inequality structure present
in GCRL into a practical divide-and-conquer value update rule. This has several
advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms. Compared to
temporal difference (TD) methods, TRL suffers less from bias accumulation, as
in principle it only requires $O(\log T)$ recursions (as opposed to $O(T)$ in
TD learning) to handle a length-$T$ trajectory. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, TRL
suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming.
Experimentally, we show that TRL achieves the best performance in highly
challenging, long-horizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline GCRL
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界符号图中的连接存在噪声，现有符号图神经网络(SGNNs)的鲁棒性研究缺乏理论指导，需要同时处理输入空间和目标空间中的噪声问题。

Method: 扩展图信息瓶颈(GIB)理论，使其具备目标空间去噪能力，通过重参数化机制和变分近似构建可处理的优化目标函数，联合清理输入数据和监督目标。

Result: 在四个主流符号图数据集上的实验表明，RIDGE显著提高了流行SGNN模型在不同噪声水平下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RIDGE框架通过联合去噪输入和目标空间，为符号图学习提供了理论指导的鲁棒性解决方案，在噪声环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are widely adopted to analyze complex
patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links. Given the
noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged
as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties,
graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph
representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research
investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success
of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose
RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint
Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic
GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as
the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation,
RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable
objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational
approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed
graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness
of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.

TL;DR: 提出SDC-GBB框架，通过分支定界方法解决带约束聚类的NP-hard问题，能处理大规模数据集并保证全局最优性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合整数优化方法只能处理小规模数据集，限制了带约束聚类的实用性

Method: 使用可分解的分支定界框架，将must-link样本聚合成伪样本，通过几何规则剪枝cannot-link约束，结合分组样本拉格朗日分解和几何消除规则

Result: 能处理20万样本的cannot-link约束和150万样本的must-link约束，比现有方法规模大200-1500倍，最优性差距小于3%

Conclusion: 该方法提供了确定性全局保证，避免了现成启发式方法在大数据集上的搜索失败问题

Abstract: Constrained clustering leverages limited domain knowledge to improve
clustering performance and interpretability, but incorporating pairwise
must-link and cannot-link constraints is an NP-hard challenge, making global
optimization intractable. Existing mixed-integer optimization methods are
confined to small-scale datasets, limiting their utility. We propose
Sample-Driven Constrained Group-Based Branch-and-Bound (SDC-GBB), a
decomposable branch-and-bound (BB) framework that collapses must-linked samples
into centroid-based pseudo-samples and prunes cannot-link through geometric
rules, while preserving convergence and guaranteeing global optimality. By
integrating grouped-sample Lagrangian decomposition and geometric elimination
rules for efficient lower and upper bounds, the algorithm attains highly
scalable pairwise k-Means constrained clustering via parallelism. Experimental
results show that our approach handles datasets with 200,000 samples with
cannot-link constraints and 1,500,000 samples with must-link constraints, which
is 200 - 1500 times larger than the current state-of-the-art under comparable
constraint settings, while reaching an optimality gap of less than 3%. In
providing deterministic global guarantees, our method also avoids the search
failures that off-the-shelf heuristics often encounter on large datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了随机搜索神经网络(RSNNs)来解决随机游走神经网络(RWNNs)在采样约束下无法捕获全局结构的问题，通过在稀疏图中使用O(log|V|)次搜索实现完整边覆盖，显著减少采样复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走神经网络在现实采样约束下往往无法捕获图的全局结构，限制了其表达能力，特别是在节点和边覆盖不完整的情况下。

Method: 提出随机搜索神经网络，每个随机搜索保证完整的节点覆盖，与通用序列模型结合使用，在稀疏图中仅需O(log|V|)次搜索即可实现完整边覆盖。

Result: RSNNs在分子和蛋白质基准测试中始终优于RWNNs，在采样序列减少16倍的情况下仍能达到相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: RSNNs为基于随机游走的方法提供了理论和实践上的进步，为稀疏图学习提供了一个高效且表达能力强的框架。

Abstract: Random walk neural networks (RWNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for
graph representation learning, leveraging recent advances in sequence models to
process random walks. However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs
often fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete
node and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we
propose \textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random
searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\log |V|)$ searches are needed to
achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared
to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph
size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are
universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant
to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant
graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular
and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to
16$\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical
advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive
framework for learning on sparse graphs.

TL;DR: IsoNet++是一种基于早期交互的图神经网络，通过跨图消息传递、惰性对齐更新和节点对交互等创新技术，显著提升了子图匹配的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的子图同构检索方法如IsoNet采用后期交互模型，独立计算图嵌入后再进行对齐。为了更有效地进行子图匹配，需要开发早期交互模型来在嵌入计算过程中直接考虑图间关系。

Method: 1. 在输入图之间进行跨图消息传递，基于节点间的单射对齐；2. 多轮惰性对齐更新，每轮基于当前对齐状态重新运行GNN；3. 引入节点对交互概念，考虑节点对而非单个节点作为潜在对齐伙伴。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，对齐随着轮次逐渐优化，检索性能显著优于现有方法，所有三个创新技术都对精度提升有贡献。

Conclusion: IsoNet++通过早期交互、惰性对齐更新和节点对交互等技术创新，实现了比现有方法更好的子图匹配检索性能。

Abstract: Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world
applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and
circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for
subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each
graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment
map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network
(GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of
all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by
an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in
a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN
from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion
of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments,
and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of
node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention
between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention
then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node
pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between
the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for
refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the
alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in
significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We
demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our
code and datasets are publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文提出FAPO方法，通过检测和惩罚有缺陷的正向推理轨迹，解决RLVR训练中模型学习不可靠推理模式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法将包含错误推理模式但得到正确答案的轨迹与完全正确的轨迹同等奖励，导致模型内化不可靠的推理模式，限制了推理能力的长期发展。

Method: 提出FAPO方法，使用生成式奖励模型(GenRM)精确定位推理错误，对有缺陷的正向轨迹施加参数无关的奖励惩罚，在训练初期利用这些轨迹作为捷径，后期逐步转向可靠的推理模式。

Result: 实验表明FAPO在多个领域有效，提高了结果正确性、过程可靠性和训练稳定性，且不增加计算开销。

Conclusion: FAPO通过区分有缺陷和完全正确的推理轨迹，实现了更稳定和可靠的强化学习训练，提升了语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and
exploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy
optimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as
answer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are
rewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to
internalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct
a systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable
rapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining
reasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on
these insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which
presents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling
the policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing
stable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable
reasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively
detect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM)
with a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors.
Experiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome
correctness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the
token budget.

Motivation: 随着技术进步，过程日志现在来自非确定性源（如不确定传感器或机器学习模型），这些随机日志包含概率信息，需要可靠的随机轨迹恢复方法来理解系统过程。

Method: 基于扩散去噪概率模型(DDPM)的深度学习方法，利用过程知识（隐式发现模型或显式注入过程知识到训练阶段）通过去噪来恢复轨迹。

Result: 实证评估显示达到最先进性能，比现有方法提升高达25%，在高噪声水平下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为从随机日志中恢复轨迹提供了有效的解决方案，在性能和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: With recent technological advances, process logs, which were traditionally
deterministic in nature, are being captured from non-deterministic sources,
such as uncertain sensors or machine learning models (that predict activities
using cameras). In the presence of stochastically-known logs, logs that contain
probabilistic information, the need for stochastic trace recovery increases, to
offer reliable means of understanding the processes that govern such systems.
We design a novel deep learning approach for stochastic trace recovery, based
on Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which makes use of process
knowledge (either implicitly by discovering a model or explicitly by injecting
process knowledge in the training phase) to recover traces by denoising. We
conduct an empirical evaluation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with
up to a 25% improvement over existing methods, along with increased robustness
under high noise levels.

Conclusion: 提出的时变Lyapunov函数方法有效解决了任意时间在线学习问题，在在线最短路径问题中展示了实用价值

Abstract: We propose an anytime online algorithm for the problem of learning a sequence
of adversarial convex cost functions while approximately satisfying another
sequence of adversarial online convex constraints. A sequential algorithm is
called \emph{anytime} if it provides a non-trivial performance guarantee for
any intermediate timestep $t$ without requiring prior knowledge of the length
of the entire time horizon $T$. Our proposed algorithm achieves optimal
performance bounds without resorting to the standard doubling trick, which has
poor practical performance due to multiple restarts. Our core technical
contribution is the use of time-varying Lyapunov functions to keep track of
constraint violations. This must be contrasted with prior works that used a
fixed Lyapunov function tuned to the known horizon length $T$. The use of
time-varying Lyapunov function poses unique analytical challenges as
properties, such as \emph{monotonicity}, on which the prior proofs rest, no
longer hold. By introducing a new analytical technique, we show that our
algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{t})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t})$ cumulative
constraint violation bounds for any $t\geq 1$.
  We extend our results to the dynamic regret setting, achieving bounds that
adapt to the path length of the comparator sequence without prior knowledge of
its total length. We also present an adaptive algorithm in the optimistic
setting, whose performance gracefully scales with the cumulative prediction
error. We demonstrate the practical utility of our algorithm through numerical
experiments involving the online shortest path problem.

Motivation: 半监督学习中未标记数据能提升模型性能，但其效果严重依赖伪标签质量。不准确的伪标签会引入偏差，导致模型性能下降。

Method: 基于PPI思想构建无偏梯度估计器，使用插值参数平衡标记数据和伪标记数据的贡献，并通过一维在线学习算法实时调整该参数和模型参数。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将PPI扩展到SSL训练中，通过动态参数调整有效解决了伪标签偏差问题，提升了半监督学习性能。

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a recently proposed statistical
inference technique for parameter estimation that leverages pseudo-labels on
both labeled and unlabeled data to construct an unbiased, low-variance
estimator. In this work, we extend its core idea to semi-supervised learning
(SSL) for model training, introducing a novel unbiased gradient estimator. This
extension addresses a key challenge in SSL: while unlabeled data can improve
model performance, its benefit heavily depends on the quality of pseudo-labels.
Inaccurate pseudo-labels can introduce bias, leading to suboptimal models.To
balance the contributions of labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we utilize an
interpolation parameter and tune it on the fly, alongside the model parameters,
using a one-dimensional online learning algorithm. We verify the practical
advantage of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets, demonstrating improved performance over classic SSL baselines and PPI
methods that tune the interpolation parameter offline.

numerous tasks, from community detection to geometric deep learning. A wide
range of discrete curvature models have been proposed for various data
representations, including graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and
point clouds sampled from manifolds. These models not only provide efficient
characterizations of data geometry but also constitute essential components in
geometric learning frameworks. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive review of existing discrete curvature models, covering their
mathematical foundations, computational formulations, and practical
applications in data analysis and learning. In particular, we discuss discrete
curvature from both Riemannian and metric geometry perspectives and propose a
systematic pipeline for curvature-driven data analysis. We further examine the
corresponding computational algorithms across different data representations,
offering detailed comparisons and insights. Finally, we review state-of-the-art
applications of curvature in both supervised and unsupervised learning. This
survey provides a conceptual and practical roadmap for researchers to gain a
better understanding of discrete curvature as a fundamental tool for geometric
understanding and learning.

*Songhan Zhang,Yuanhao Lai,Pengfei Zheng,Boxi Yu,Xiaoying Tang,Qiuai Fu,Pinjia He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLEANet是一个针对污染多变量时间序列的鲁棒高效异常检测框架，通过污染弹性训练框架和轻量级共轭MLP解决训练数据污染和模型推理效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多变量时间序列异常检测面临两个关键挑战：训练数据污染（噪声和隐藏异常）以及低效的模型推理。现有方法假设训练数据干净，但污染会扭曲学习模式并降低检测精度，而复杂深度模型容易过拟合污染数据且延迟高。

Method: 提出CLEANet框架，包含污染弹性训练框架（CRTF），通过自适应重建权重策略和聚类引导的对比学习减轻污染样本影响；设计轻量级共轭MLP来解耦时间和跨特征依赖关系，避免过拟合并提高计算效率。

Result: 在五个公共数据集上，CLEANet相比十个最先进基线方法，F1分数最高提升73.04%，运行时间降低81.28%。将CRTF集成到三个先进模型中平均获得5.35%的F1增益。

Conclusion: CLEANet有效解决了多变量时间序列异常检测中的数据污染和效率问题，具有强泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining
the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by
two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden
anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods
assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and
degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to
contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address
these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection
framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a
Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of
corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy
combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing
robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve
computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that
disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public
datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime
compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF
into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its
strong generalizability.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉理解和查询响应生成方面取得显著进展，但由于自回归解码导致计算成本高和推理延迟大，需要解决这些效率限制。

Method: 采用模仿学习的自推测解码框架，使用轻量级草稿模型进行自回归token生成，全模型进行非自回归验证。通过模仿网络整合全模型的深层洞察来增强草稿模型。

Result: 该方法相比最终层实现了1.55-1.85倍的推理加速，同时性能损失极小，在效率和准确性之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: FastVLM框架有效解决了VLMs的推理效率问题，通过草稿模型和全模型的协同工作，在保持模型性能完整性的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual
understanding and query response generation, but often face challenges of high
computational cost and inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. In
this work, we introduce an imitation-learning-based Self-Speculative Decoding
(SSD) framework, named FastVLM, to address these limitations. Our approach
employs a lightweight draft model for token generation in an autoregressive
manner, while a full model verifies these tokens non-autoregressively. Accepted
tokens proceed seamlessly, while rejected tokens are corrected by the full
model and used to guide the draft model's refinement. Through an imitation
network, FastVLM enhances the draft model by integrating deeper level insights
from the full model's architecture. Also, it maintains the performance
integrity of the full model while training the draft model, achieving a balance
between efficiency and accuracy. Our method speeds up the inference process by
1.55-1.85x as compared to the final layer with minimal loss in performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance across a range
of graph representation learning tasks, yet their adversarial robustness in
graph classification remains underexplored compared to node classification.
While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work
investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness.
We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum,
average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and
identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph
structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular
Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant
singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level
representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and
interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed
pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power
iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool
provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean
accuracy. Our code is publicly available

Motivation: 现有密度估计方法虽然能捕捉复杂数据分布，但缺乏可解释性和不确定性量化。贝叶斯非参数方法如Polya树能解决这些问题，但传统MCMC方法计算复杂且难以扩展。

Method: 引入变分Polya树模型，采用随机变分推理计算后验分布，利用联合分布似然获得比传统平均场方法更精确的变分后验近似。

Conclusion: VPT模型提供了一个灵活的非参数贝叶斯先验，能够捕捉潜在密度，并与随机梯度优化良好配合，解决了传统方法的计算限制。

Abstract: Density estimation is essential for generative modeling, particularly with
the rise of modern neural networks. While existing methods capture complex data
distributions, they often lack interpretability and uncertainty quantification.
Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially the \polya tree, offer a robust
framework that addresses these issues by accurately capturing function behavior
over small intervals. Traditional techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) face high computational complexity and scalability limitations,
hindering the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods in deep learning. To tackle
this, we introduce the variational \polya tree (VPT) model, which employs
stochastic variational inference to compute posterior distributions. This model
provides a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian prior that captures latent
densities and works well with stochastic gradient optimization. We also
leverage the joint distribution likelihood for a more precise variational
posterior approximation than traditional mean-field methods. We evaluate the
model performance on both real data and images, and demonstrate its
competitiveness with other state-of-the-art deep density estimation methods. We
also explore its ability in enhancing interpretability and uncertainty
quantification. Code is available at

Method: 引入了一个理论框架，连接初始化策略与网络对对抗扰动的弹性，分析了初始权重、训练轮数与模型脆弱性之间的直接关系，并将理论框架扩展到深度神经网络。

Result: 实验表明，选择合适的初始化不仅能确保在干净数据集上的性能，还能显著增强模型对抗扰动的鲁棒性，与其他初始化方法相比，鲁棒性差距可达50%。

Conclusion: 权重初始化和训练轮数是影响模型对抗鲁棒性的重要因素，适当的初始化策略可以提供超越传统防御机制的新鲁棒性见解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their
vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies
focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing
schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of
weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs,
on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the
connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to
adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between
initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability,
offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense
mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical
framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.
Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets
subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate
that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean
datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations,
with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在在线学习环境中，如何在有限训练预算下动态选择多个自适应学习算法的问题，这在流式模型选择、金融交易策略切换等应用中很重要。

Method: 设计了M-LCB算法，这是一种UCB风格的元算法，使用置信区间直接基于实际损失构建，无需额外优化，能反映底层专家的收敛特性。

Result: 如果每个专家实现内部遗憾为O(T^α)，则M-LCB确保整体遗憾上界为O(√(KT/M) + (K/M)^(1-α)T^α)，这是首个在预算约束下同时训练多个自适应专家的遗憾保证结果。

Conclusion: M-LCB将经典bandit范式扩展到更现实的场景：在有限资源下协调有状态的自学习专家，为在线元学习提供了理论框架。

Abstract: In many modern applications, a system must dynamically choose between several
adaptive learning algorithms that are trained online. Examples include model
selection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in
finance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning
agents. At each round, a learner must select one predictor among $K$ adaptive
experts to make a prediction, while being able to update at most $M \le K$ of
them under a fixed training budget.
  We address this problem in the \emph{stochastic setting} and introduce
\algname{M-LCB}, a computationally efficient UCB-style meta-algorithm that
provides \emph{anytime regret guarantees}. Its confidence intervals are built
directly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and
seamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts. If
each expert achieves internal regret $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$, then \algname{M-LCB}
ensures overall regret bounded by $\tilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\;
(K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees
when multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round
budget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases:
(i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts
that are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how
\algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic
scenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited
resources.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on
strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse
views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations
requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational
invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we
propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces
augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete
frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete
spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced
by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the
complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves
superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through
strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine
datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific
characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without
relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance
gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches. Source code:

Method: 利用流匹配建模价值分布并生成样本进行价值估计，区别于传统的确定性价值预测回归方法

Result: 

Conclusion: 流匹配在生成建模中的成功启发了价值估计的生成范式

Abstract: Reliable value estimation serves as the cornerstone of reinforcement learning
(RL) by evaluating long-term returns and guiding policy improvement,
significantly influencing the convergence speed and final performance. Existing
works improve the reliability of value function estimation via multi-critic
ensembles and distributional RL, yet the former merely combines multi point
estimation without capturing distributional information, whereas the latter
relies on discretization or quantile regression, limiting the expressiveness of
complex value distributions. Inspired by flow matching's success in generative
modeling, we propose a generative paradigm for value estimation, named
FlowCritic. Departing from conventional regression for deterministic value
prediction, FlowCritic leverages flow matching to model value distributions and
generate samples for value estimation.

Abstract: Recovering causal structure in the presence of latent variables is an
important but challenging task. While many methods have been proposed to handle
it, most of them require strict and/or untestable assumptions on the causal
structure. In real-world scenarios, observed variables may be affected by
multiple latent variables simultaneously, which, generally speaking, cannot be
handled by these methods. In this paper, we consider the linear, non-Gaussian
case, and make use of the joint higher-order cumulant matrix of the observed
variables constructed in a specific way. We show that, surprisingly, causal
asymmetry between two observed variables can be directly seen from the rank
deficiency properties of such higher-order cumulant matrices, even in the
presence of an arbitrary number of latent confounders. Identifiability results
are established, and the corresponding identification methods do not even
involve iterative procedures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and asymptotic correctness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only
accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales
and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise
in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset
has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce
S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical
images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly
linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16
languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability.
Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med,
LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that
SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity,
and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with
retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual
grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new
mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning,
improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark
for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and

Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively
adapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which
they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the
structure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we
introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action
Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a
model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in
cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a
lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner
proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in
cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and
update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On
the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%
success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous
systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning.
Ablations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and

Abstract: Gaussian-Process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), is a prevailing
model-based framework for DBMS auto-tuning. However, recent work shows
GP-BO-based DBMS auto-tuners significantly outperformed auto-tuners based on
SMAC, which features random forest surrogate models; such results motivate us
to rethink and investigate the limitations of GP-BO in auto-tuner design. We
find the fundamental assumptions of GP-BO are widely violated when modeling and
optimizing DBMS performance, while tree-ensemble-BOs (e.g., SMAC) can avoid the
assumption pitfalls and deliver improved tuning efficiency and effectiveness.
Moreover, we argue that existing tree-ensemble-BOs restrict further advancement
in DBMS auto-tuning. First, existing tree-ensemble-BOs can only achieve
distribution-free point estimates, but still impose unrealistic distributional
assumptions on uncertainty estimates, compromising surrogate modeling and
distort the acquisition function. Second, recent advances in gradient boosting,
which can further enhance surrogate modeling against vanilla GP and random
forest counterparts, have rarely been applied in optimizing DBMS auto-tuners.
To address these issues, we propose a novel model-based DBMS auto-tuner,
Centrum. Centrum improves distribution-free point and interval estimation in
surrogate modeling with a two-phase learning procedure of stochastic gradient
boosting ensembles. Moreover, Centrum adopts a generalized SGBE-estimated
locally-adaptive conformal prediction to facilitate a distribution-free
uncertainty estimation and acquisition function. To our knowledge, Centrum is
the first auto-tuner to realize distribution-freeness, enhancing BO's
practicality in DBMS auto-tuning, and the first to seamlessly fuse gradient
boosting ensembles and conformal inference in BO. Extensive physical and
simulation experiments on two DBMSs and three workloads show Centrum
outperforms 21 SOTA methods.

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型的DRO方法能够有效提升模型的分布外泛化能力，为分布鲁棒优化提供了新的可行解决方案。

Abstract: This paper studies Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), a fundamental
framework for enhancing the robustness and generalization of statistical
learning and optimization. An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve
distributions that remain consistent with the nominal distribution while being
diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it
should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose a
diffusion-based ambiguity set design that captures various adversarial
distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency
with the nominal distribution. Building on this ambiguity modeling, we propose
Diffusion-based DRO (D-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner
maximization over the parameterized diffusion model space. We formally
establish the stationary convergence performance of D-DRO and empirically
demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance
in a ML prediction task.

Method: 在推理时直接修剪整个Transformer层，通过优化任务特定验证性能来选择要移除的层。

Result: 在9个任务和5个模型上的评估显示，TALE在所有基准测试中一致提高准确性并减少计算成本，在微调时应用还能带来额外性能提升。

Conclusion: TALE产生更小、更快、更准确的模型，同时提供对准确性和效率权衡的灵活控制，并为Transformer可解释性提供新见解。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Tale, Task-Aware Layer Elimination, an
inference-time algorithm that prunes entire transformer layers in an LLM by
directly optimizing task-specific validation performance. We evaluate TALE on 9
tasks and 5 models, including LLaMA 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Mistral
7B, and Lucie 7B, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Unlike prior
approaches, TALE requires no retraining and consistently improves accuracy
while reducing computational cost across all benchmarks. Furthermore, applying
TALE during finetuning leads to additional performance gains. Finally, TALE
provides flexible user control over trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
Mutual information analysis shows that certain layers act as bottlenecks,
degrading task-relevant representations. Tale's selective layer removal
remedies this problem, producing smaller, faster, and more accurate models that
are also faster to fine-tune while offering new insights into transformer
interpretability.

*Wenrui Cai,Defa Zhu,Qingjie Liu,Qiyang Min*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SeeDNorm动态归一化方法，通过基于输入动态调整缩放系数来增强模型表示能力，在保持RMSNorm优点的同时解决了静态缩放因子不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMSNorm丢弃了输入范数信息，静态缩放因子γ难以适应输入数据和分布变化的广泛变异性，特别是在大语言模型遇到的零样本场景中限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出SeeDNorm，通过动态调整缩放系数来保留输入范数信息，实现数据依赖的自重缩放动态归一化。在反向传播中保持RMSNorm根据输入范数动态调整梯度的能力，并解决了潜在的不稳定性问题。

Result: 在不同规模的大语言模型预训练以及监督和无监督计算机视觉任务中验证了SeeDNorm的有效性。通过引入极少参数且对模型效率影响可忽略，相比RMSNorm、LayerNorm和DyT等归一化层实现了持续优越的性能。

Conclusion: SeeDNorm通过动态缩放机制有效提升了模型表示能力，在各种任务中均表现出优于现有归一化方法的性能，为解决静态归一化限制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Normalization layer constitutes an essential component in neural networks. In
transformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit
hypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling
coefficient $\gamma$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model.
However, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a
static scaling factor $\gamma$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide
variability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further
performance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large
language models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose
SeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by
dynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input,
thereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent,
self-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains
the ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input
norm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm
and proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues
that may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of
SeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as
well as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a
minimal number of parameters and with neglligible impact on model efficiency,
SeeDNorm achieves consistently superior performance compared to previously
commonly used normalization layers such as RMSNorm and LayerNorm, as well as
element-wise activation alternatives to normalization layers like DyT.

TL;DR: NBF-Rec是一种基于图的推荐模型，支持在用户和物品集合不相交的数据集之间进行归纳迁移学习，无需为每个领域重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于图的推荐系统通常在转导设置下训练，限制了其在新用户、新物品或新数据集上的适用性。

Method: NBF-Rec在推理时动态计算节点嵌入，使用交互级消息传递，支持零样本设置和轻量级微调。

Result: 在七个真实世界数据集上的评估显示，NBF-Rec在零样本设置下达到竞争性性能，并通过微调获得进一步改进。

Conclusion: 基于图的推荐中的归纳迁移是可行的，交互级消息传递支持跨数据集泛化，无需对齐用户或物品。

Abstract: Graph-based recommender systems are commonly trained in transductive
settings, which limits their applicability to new users, items, or datasets. We
propose NBF-Rec, a graph-based recommendation model that supports inductive
transfer learning across datasets with disjoint user and item sets. Unlike
conventional embedding-based methods that require retraining for each domain,
NBF-Rec computes node embeddings dynamically at inference time. We evaluate the
method on seven real-world datasets spanning movies, music, e-commerce, and
location check-ins. NBF-Rec achieves competitive performance in zero-shot
settings, where no target domain data is used for training, and demonstrates
further improvements through lightweight fine-tuning. These results show that
inductive transfer is feasible in graph-based recommendation and that
interaction-level message passing supports generalization across datasets
without requiring aligned users or items.

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论惊异度的无模型机器学习框架，替代传统显式建模方法，实现灵活、可解释的通用推理，在多种任务中达到或接近SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习依赖显式模型和领域假设，限制了灵活性和可解释性。需要一种能够直接分析原始数据、减少偏差、支持高效更新的统一框架。

Method: 使用惊异度（信息论不确定性）作为核心度量，量化相关性，消除分布建模需求。支持直接编辑和删除训练数据，实现可追溯、可解释的数据驱动决策。

Result: 在生成推理、因果发现、异常检测和时间序列预测等任务中达到或接近最先进性能，能够有效处理复杂数据类型包括缺失数据。

Conclusion: 该框架为可扩展机器学习和人工智能提供了替代神经网络的可行路径，同时保持底层机制的人类可理解性，创建了信息的"物理学"基础。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning relies on explicit models and domain
assumptions, limiting flexibility and interpretability. We introduce a
model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to
directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution
modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits
and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty,
the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative
inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It
emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making,
offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and
achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine
learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of
information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide
variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results
indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with
regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can
maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体在随机时变通信图上的协作学习问题，其中每个智能体对同一臂的奖励分布可能不同，目标是相对于全局平均奖励最小化累积遗憾。

Method: 提出完全分布式算法，将臂淘汰策略与随机gossip算法结合。算法在随机通信图上运行，其中每个时间步的通信图通过Erdős-Rényi模型在固定基础图上生成。

Result: 理论证明遗憾上界为O(log T)，包含最优集中式遗憾项和反映通信效率影响的额外项。额外项与代数连通性和链路概率相关，揭示了通信效率与遗憾之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 所提算法在理论和实验上均优于现有基准，验证了遗憾随问题复杂度的理论缩放规律，为分布式协作学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with
heterogeneous rewards over random communication graphs. Uniquely, at each time
step $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by
applying the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for
classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each
potential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link
probability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily
connected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant
distributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across
agents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the
global mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean
rewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed
algorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip
algorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\log
T$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the
optimal centralized regret $O\left(\sum_{k: \Delta_k>0} \frac{\log
T}{\Delta_k}\right)$ and an additional term $O\left(\frac{N^2 \log T}{p
\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \frac{KN^2 \log T}{p}\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote
the total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the
impact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link
probability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between
communication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal
regret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the
superiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the
theoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合LOESS分解、ARIMA建模和多尺度CNN-BiLSTM网络的混合预测框架，用于印度大城市的空气质量指数预测，在多个污染物上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度大城市空气质量污染严重，污染物水平突然飙升给及时干预带来挑战。由于同时存在线性趋势、季节变化和波动非线性模式，准确的AQI预测十分困难。

Method: 使用LOESS将AQI序列分解为趋势、季节和残差分量，ARIMA建模平滑分量，提出的多尺度CNN-BiLSTM网络结合残差门控注意力机制捕捉残差中的多尺度波动。通过UAMMO优化器调整模型超参数。

Result: 在2021-2023年中央污染控制委员会AQI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在PM2.5、O3、CO和NOx等多个污染物上持续优于统计、深度学习和混合基线方法，MSE降低5-8%，R²分数>0.94。

Conclusion: 该框架在应对突发污染事件方面表现出鲁棒性和敏感性，适用于城市空气质量管理的实际应用。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical environmental and public health concern in
Indian megacities such as Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, where sudden spikes in
pollutant levels challenge timely intervention. Accurate Air Quality Index
(AQI) forecasting is difficult due to the coexistence of linear trends,
seasonal variations, and volatile nonlinear patterns. This paper proposes a
hybrid forecasting framework that integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA
modeling, and a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention
mechanism. The LOESS step separates the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and
residual components, with ARIMA modeling the smooth components and the proposed
deep learning module capturing multi-scale volatility in the residuals. Model
hyperparameters are tuned via the Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic
Optimizer (UAMMO), combining multiple optimization strategies for efficient
convergence. Experiments on 2021-2023 AQI datasets from the Central Pollution
Control Board show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
statistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines across PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx
in three major cities, achieving up to 5-8% lower MSE and higher R^2 scores
(>0.94) for all pollutants. These results demonstrate the framework's
robustness, sensitivity to sudden pollution events, and applicability to urban
air quality management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了BOBW FTRL算法在赌博机问题中的最后迭代收敛性，证明了使用1/2-Tsallis-INF正则化器时，最优臂与算法在迭代t时获得的臂分布之间的Bregman散度以t^{-1/2}速率衰减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习算法的收敛分析是机器学习理论的核心，其中最后迭代收敛特别重要，因为它捕捉了学习者的实际决策并描述了学习过程随时间的演变。然而在多臂赌博机问题中，现有分析主要关注遗憾阶数，而最后迭代收敛速率研究较少，特别是对于广泛研究的FTRL算法。

Method: 通过理论分析研究BOBW FTRL算法的最后迭代收敛性，特别关注使用正则函数Ψ(p)=-4∑√p_i的1/2-Tsallis-INF算法，分析Bregman散度的衰减速率。

Result: 证明了Bregman散度（定义为最优臂的点质量与算法在迭代t时获得的臂分布之间的散度）以t^{-1/2}的速率衰减，部分证实了对数遗憾应与t^{-1}最后迭代收敛速率对应的直觉。

Conclusion: 本文部分证实了对数遗憾与最后迭代收敛速率之间的直觉联系，为BOBW FTRL算法在赌博机问题中的收敛性分析提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The convergence analysis of online learning algorithms is central to machine
learning theory, where last-iterate convergence is particularly important, as
it captures the learner's actual decisions and describes the evolution of the
learning process over time. However, in multi-armed bandits, most existing
algorithmic analyses mainly focus on the order of regret, while the
last-iterate (simple regret) convergence rate remains less explored --
especially for the widely studied Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)
algorithms. Recently, a growing line of work has established the
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) property of FTRL algorithms in bandit problems,
showing in particular that they achieve logarithmic regret in stochastic
bandits. Nevertheless, their last-iterate convergence rate has not yet been
studied. Intuitively, logarithmic regret should correspond to a $t^{-1}$
last-iterate convergence rate. This paper partially confirms this intuition
through theoretical analysis, showing that the Bregman divergence, defined by
the regular function $\Psi(p)=-4\sum_{i=1}^{d}\sqrt{p_i}$ associated with the
BOBW FTRL algorithm $1/2$-Tsallis-INF (arXiv:1807.07623), between the point
mass on the optimal arm and the probability distribution over the arm set
obtained at iteration $t$, decays at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合逻辑推理与GAN生成能力，在有限逻辑深度约束下实现可解释的样本生成，提供可控的生成质量保证。

Method: 使用深度k的Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé游戏框架，判别器作为对手寻找逻辑故障，生成器作为构建者生成匹配目标理论的样本，采用逻辑损失函数混合EF轮次弹性与证书项。

Result: 仿真验证达到92%-98%属性满足率，真实神经GAN训练在挑战性属性上提升5%-14%，连通性达到98%满足率。

Conclusion: LOGAN提供了逻辑约束生成的可复现路径，具有可解释的失败模式、经过验证的有效性（仿真和真实训练）以及可控参数。

Abstract: GANs promise indistinguishability, logic explains it. We put the two on a
budget: a discriminator that can only ``see'' up to a logical depth $k$, and a
generator that must look correct to that bounded observer. \textbf{LOGAN}
(LOGical GANs) casts the discriminator as a depth-$k$ Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e
(EF) \emph{Opponent} that searches for small, legible faults (odd cycles,
nonplanar crossings, directed bridges), while the generator plays
\emph{Builder}, producing samples that admit a $k$-round matching to a target
theory $T$. We ship a minimal toolkit -- an EF-probe simulator and MSO-style
graph checkers -- and four experiments including real neural GAN training with
PyTorch. Beyond verification, we score samples with a \emph{logical loss} that
mixes budgeted EF round-resilience with cheap certificate terms, enabling a
practical curriculum on depth. Framework validation demonstrates $92\%$--$98\%$
property satisfaction via simulation (Exp.~3), while real neural GAN training
achieves $5\%$--$14\%$ improvements on challenging properties and $98\%$
satisfaction on connectivity (matching simulation) through adversarial learning
(Exp.~4). LOGAN is a compact, reproducible path toward logic-bounded generation
with interpretable failures, proven effectiveness (both simulated and real
training), and dials for control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序数据存在测量噪声和生物变异性，导致在标准潜在空间中不同细胞类型的数据可能投影得很接近，使得准确聚类变得困难。

Method: 引入潜在即插即用扩散框架，分离观测空间和去噪空间。通过新颖的吉布斯采样程序：在低维潜在空间应用学习的扩散先验进行去噪，同时在原始高维观测空间重新引入噪声来引导这一过程。

Result: 在合成数据和真实单细胞基因组数据上评估了鲁棒性。在合成数据上，该方法在不同噪声水平和数据集偏移下提高了聚类准确性。在真实单细胞数据上，得到的细胞簇具有更好的生物学一致性，簇边界更符合已知细胞类型标记和发育轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分离观测和去噪空间，提供自适应噪声处理、不确定性量化和通用化去噪能力，显著提高了单细胞RNA测序数据的聚类准确性和生物学解释性。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular
heterogeneity. Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based
on cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological
variability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from
different cell types can be projected close together, making accurate
clustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework
that separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is
operationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion
prior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while
to steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional
observation space. This unique "input-space steering" ensures the denoising
trajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers
three key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between
prior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled
uncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising
by leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via
averaging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on
both synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves
clustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset
shifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved
biological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries
that better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 开发了一个物理信息机器学习框架，用于建模和预测随机FitzHugh-Nagumo神经元中的自诱导随机共振现象，通过嵌入随机微分方程和物理约束来提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自诱导随机共振(SISR)是慢-快可激发系统中仅由噪声驱动的相干振荡现象，传统方法计算成本高且缺乏物理可解释性，需要开发更高效准确的建模方法。

Method: 基于物理信息神经网络(PINN)构建噪声增强状态预测器架构，将随机微分方程和SISR渐近时间尺度匹配约束直接嵌入网络，损失函数整合数据保真度、动力学残差和基于Kramers逃逸理论的物理约束。

Result: 训练后的PINN能准确预测尖峰序列相干性对噪声强度、兴奋性和时间尺度分离的依赖关系，与直接随机模拟结果匹配，相比纯数据驱动方法在精度和泛化性上有显著提升，计算需求大幅降低。

Conclusion: 该框架为模拟和分析多尺度随机系统中的噪声诱导相干性提供了一个数据高效且可解释的替代模型，在神经科学和复杂系统研究中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR) is the emergence of coherent
oscillations in slow-fast excitable systems driven solely by noise, without
external periodic forcing or proximity to a bifurcation. This work presents a
physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling and predicting SISR in
the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron. We embed the governing stochastic
differential equations and SISR-asymptotic timescale-matching constraints
directly into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based on a
Noise-Augmented State Predictor architecture. The composite loss integrates
data fidelity, dynamical residuals, and barrier-based physical constraints
derived from Kramers' escape theory. The trained PINN accurately predicts the
dependence of spike-train coherence on noise intensity, excitability, and
timescale separation, matching results from direct stochastic simulations with
substantial improvements in accuracy and generalization compared with purely
data-driven methods, while requiring significantly less computation. The
framework provides a data-efficient and interpretable surrogate model for
simulating and analyzing noise-induced coherence in multiscale stochastic
systems.

Conclusion: E2D2框架通过专门的编码器-解码器架构、训练和采样算法，显著提高了离散扩散模型的推理效率

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models enable parallel token sampling for faster inference
than autoregressive approaches. However, prior diffusion models use a
decoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the
full network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key
insight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1)
representing clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us
to use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder
architecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an
encoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively
refine a noised sequence. We also show that this architecture enables faster
training of block diffusion models, which partition sequences into blocks for
better quality and are commonly used in diffusion language model inference. We
introduce a framework for Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2),
consisting of an architecture with specialized training and sampling
algorithms, and we show that E2D2 achieves superior trade-offs between
generation quality and inference throughput on summarization, translation, and
mathematical reasoning tasks. We provide the code, model weights, and blog post

Abstract: Precipitation prediction has undergone a profound transformation -- from
early symbolic and empirical methods rooted in divination and observation, to
modern technologies based on atmospheric physics and artificial intelligence.
This review traces the historical and technological evolution of precipitation
forecasting, presenting a survey about end-to-end precipitation prediction
technologies that spans ancient practices, the foundations of meteorological
science, the rise of numerical weather prediction (NWP), and the emergence of
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. We first explore
traditional and indigenous forecasting methods, then describe the development
of physical modeling and statistical frameworks that underpin contemporary
operational forecasting. Particular emphasis is placed on recent advances in
neural network-based approaches, including automated deep learning,
interpretability-driven design, and hybrid physical-data models. By compositing
research across multiple eras and paradigms, this review not only depicts the
history of end-to-end precipitation prediction but also outlines future
directions in next generation forecasting systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合离线-在线强化学习(O2O RL)承诺样本效率和鲁棒探索，但由于离线与在线数据之间的分布偏移而存在不稳定性。

Method: 提出RLPD-GX框架，将策略优化与安全执行解耦；使用动态课程逐步扩展时间视野并退火离线-在线数据混合；证明受保护Bellman算子的收缩性质。

Result: 在Atari-100k上达到3.02的归一化平均分数（比先前混合方法提高45%），具有更强的安全性和稳定性；在安全关键和长视野任务上表现一致。

Conclusion: 解耦的安全执行为鲁棒O2O RL提供了一条简单而原则性的途径，为强化学习中探索与安全的协调提出了更广泛的范式。

Abstract: Hybrid offline--online reinforcement learning (O2O RL) promises both sample
efficiency and robust exploration, but suffers from instability due to
distribution shift between offline and online data. We introduce RLPD-GX, a
framework that decouples policy optimization from safety enforcement: a
reward-seeking learner explores freely, while a projection-based guardian
guarantees rule-consistent execution and safe value backups. This design
preserves the exploratory value of online interactions without collapsing to
conservative policies. To further stabilize training, we propose dynamic
curricula that gradually extend temporal horizons and anneal offline--online
data mixing. We prove convergence via a contraction property of the guarded
Bellman operator, and empirically show state-of-the-art performance on
Atari-100k, achieving a normalized mean score of 3.02 (+45\% over prior hybrid
methods) with stronger safety and stability. Beyond Atari, ablations
demonstrate consistent gains across safety-critical and long-horizon tasks,
underscoring the generality of our design. Extensive and comprehensive results
highlight decoupled safety enforcement as a simple yet principled route to
robust O2O RL, suggesting a broader paradigm for reconciling exploration and
safety in reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在48小时后的PM2.5预测稳定性不足，特别是在监测网络稀疏的城市中，无法满足公共卫生预警系统的需求。

Method: 结合动态时间规整进行智能站点相似性选择，使用轻量级CNN-GRU架构增强气象特征，设计适用于稀疏网络的可扩展方案。

Result: 在伊朗伊斯法罕8个监测站的多年小时数据验证中，24小时预测R2达0.91，首次实现稳定的10天预测（240小时R2=0.73）且无性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架计算效率高且不依赖外部工具，特别适合资源受限的城市环境部署，解决了关键预警系统需求。

Abstract: Reliable long-term forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is critical for public
health early-warning systems, yet existing deep learning approaches struggle to
maintain prediction stability beyond 48 hours, especially in cities with sparse
monitoring networks. This paper presents a deep learning framework that
combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for intelligent station similarity
selection with a CNN-GRU architecture to enable extended-horizon PM2.5
forecasting in Isfahan, Iran, a city characterized by complex pollution
dynamics and limited monitoring coverage. Unlike existing approaches that rely
on computationally intensive transformer models or external simulation tools,
our method integrates three key innovations: (i) DTW-based historical sampling
to identify similar pollution patterns across peer stations, (ii) a lightweight
CNN-GRU architecture augmented with meteorological features, and (iii) a
scalable design optimized for sparse networks. Experimental validation using
multi-year hourly data from eight monitoring stations demonstrates superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving R2 =
0.91 for 24-hour forecasts. Notably, this is the first study to demonstrate
stable 10-day PM2.5 forecasting (R2 = 0.73 at 240 hours) without performance
degradation, addressing critical early-warning system requirements. The
framework's computational efficiency and independence from external tools make
it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained urban
environments.

*Nicholas I-Hsien Kuo,Blanca Gallego,Louisa Jorm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究测试了基础模型在临床数据上的表现，发现虽然能生成看似真实的特征分布，但无法保持临床特征间的相关性结构，揭示了生成式预训练在临床领域的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来一些研究将基础模型的表示直接用于表型发现而缺乏严格验证，存在生成表面真实但临床不连贯嵌入的风险，需要测试这种不匹配现象。

Method: 在HIV抗逆转录病毒治疗和急性低血压两个纵向数据集上训练了两个自回归模型（序列到序列LSTM和简化Transformer），训练时添加随机访问间隔以引入受控不规则性，测试序列保持完整，通过患者轨迹合成评估分布和相关性保真度。

Result: 两个模型都能复现特征分布，但都未能保持跨特征结构，表明生成式预训练能产生局部真实性但临床连贯性有限。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了领域特定评估的必要性，并支持将轨迹合成作为微调或部署前的实用探测方法。

Abstract: Foundation models refer to architectures trained on vast datasets using
autoregressive pre-training from natural language processing to capture
intricate patterns and motifs. They were originally developed to transfer such
learned knowledge to downstream predictive tasks. Recently, however, some
studies repurpose these learned representations for phenotype discovery without
rigorous validation, risking superficially realistic but clinically incoherent
embeddings. To test this mismatch, we trained two autoregressive models -- a
sequence-to-sequence LSTM and a reduced Transformer -- on longitudinal ART for
HIV and Acute Hypotension datasets. Controlled irregularity was added during
training via random inter-visit gaps, while test sequences stayed complete.
Patient-trajectory synthesis evaluated distributional and correlational
fidelity. Both reproduced feature distributions but failed to preserve
cross-feature structure -- showing that generative pre-training yields local
realism but limited clinical coherence. These results highlight the need for
domain-specific evaluation and support trajectory synthesis as a practical
probe before fine-tuning or deployment.

*Duong M. Nguyen,Trong Nghia Hoang,Thanh Trung Huynh,Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen,Phi Le Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习框架，通过可学习的客户端嵌入控制来处理多模态联邦学习中的不完整和异构数据问题，实现局部自适应表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多模态联邦学习经常遇到客户端数据不完整和异构的问题，导致局部特征表示不对齐，限制了模型聚合的效果。现有方法假设要么模态集不同但输入特征完整，要么模态集共享但特征缺失，而本文考虑更一般和现实的设置：每个客户端观察不同的模态子集，且每个模态内也可能有缺失特征。

Method: 提出基于可学习客户端嵌入控制的联邦学习框架，这些嵌入编码每个客户端的数据缺失模式，作为重构信号来对齐全局聚合表示与局部上下文。嵌入控制可以在具有相似数据缺失模式的客户端间进行算法聚合，增强重构信号在适应全局表示时的鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个具有不同数据缺失模式的联邦多模态基准测试中，该方法在严重数据不完整情况下实现了高达36.45%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过客户端嵌入控制有效解决了多模态联邦学习中的数据不完整和异构问题，理论分析和实证结果均验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning in real-world settings often encounters
incomplete and heterogeneous data across clients. This results in misaligned
local feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model
aggregation. Unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets
without missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features
across clients, we consider a more general and realistic setting where each
client observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing
input features within each modality. To address the resulting misalignment in
learned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework
featuring locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side
embedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns.
  These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally
aggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more
effective use of shared information. Furthermore, the embedding controls can be
algorithmically aggregated across clients with similar data-missing patterns to
enhance the robustness of reconfiguration signals in adapting the global
representation. Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks
with diverse data-missing patterns across clients demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\% performance improvement under
severe data incompleteness. The method is also supported by a theoretical
analysis with an explicit performance bound that matches our empirical
observations. Our source codes are provided at

*Saeed Najafi,Alona Fyshe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最大边际似然估计的新方法MMPO，用于对齐大语言模型与人类偏好，相比传统RLHF方法更简单稳定，无需显式奖励模型和熵最大化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人类反馈强化学习方法复杂且不稳定，需要更简单有效的对齐方法。

Method: 通过最大边际似然估计框架重新构建对齐问题，使用偏好对作为样本进行近似，最大化偏好文本输出的边际对数似然。

Result: 在135M到8B参数模型上验证，MMPO对超参数β更稳定，在保持偏好对齐竞争力的同时更好地保留基础模型的语言能力。

Conclusion: MMPO通过梯度更新中的隐式偏好优化实现了改进性能，为LLM对齐提供了更简单有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial, but
standard methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are
often complex and unstable. In this work, we propose a new, simpler approach
that recasts alignment through the lens of Maximum Marginal Likelihood (MML)
estimation. Our new MML based Preference Optimization (MMPO) maximizes the
marginal log-likelihood of a preferred text output, using the preference pair
as samples for approximation, and forgoes the need for both an explicit reward
model and entropy maximization. We theoretically demonstrate that MMPO
implicitly performs preference optimization, producing a weighted gradient that
naturally up-weights chosen responses over rejected ones. Across models ranging
from 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable
with respect to the hyperparameter $\beta$ compared to alternative baselines,
and 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better
preserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of
ablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed
attributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient
updates.

Motivation: 传统语言景观研究依赖人工拍摄和标注公共标识，过程耗时且难以应用于大范围研究区域，需要探索自动化方法来提高效率。

Method: 构建包含1,449张地理参考照片的数据集，应用AI进行光学字符识别和语言分类，并进行人工验证以检查准确性。

Result: AI模型总体准确率为79%，识别出五种常见错误类型：扭曲、反射、表面退化、涂鸦和幻觉。AI模型会检测人类通常忽略的周边或背景文本。

Conclusion: 尽管存在局限性，AI辅助工作流程在语言景观研究中具有潜力，但AI不能完全信任，建议采用AI自动化与人工验证相结合的混合方法以获得更可靠和高效的工作流程。

Abstract: Linguistic Landscape (LL) research traditionally relies on manual photography
and annotation of public signages to examine distribution of languages in urban
space. While such methods yield valuable findings, the process is
time-consuming and difficult for large study areas. This study explores the use
of AI powered language detection method to automate LL analysis. Using Honolulu
Chinatown as a case study, we constructed a georeferenced photo dataset of
1,449 images collected by researchers and applied AI for optical character
recognition (OCR) and language classification. We also conducted manual
validations for accuracy checking. This model achieved an overall accuracy of
79%. Five recurring types of mislabeling were identified, including distortion,
reflection, degraded surface, graffiti, and hallucination. The analysis also
reveals that the AI model treats all regions of an image equally, detecting
peripheral or background texts that human interpreters typically ignore.
Despite these limitations, the results demonstrate the potential of integrating
AI-assisted workflows into LL research to reduce such time-consuming processes.
However, due to all the limitations and mis-labels, we recognize that AI cannot
be fully trusted during this process. This paper encourages a hybrid approach
combining AI automation with human validation for a more reliable and efficient
workflow.

Abstract: Natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, pose significant challenges to
daily life and incur considerable global economic losses. The emergence of
next-generation small-satellites, capable of constellation-based operations,
offers unparalleled opportunities for near-real-time monitoring and onboard
processing of such events. However, a major bottleneck remains the lack of
extensive annotated datasets capturing volcanic activity, which hinders the
development of robust detection systems. This paper introduces a novel dataset
explicitly designed for volcanic activity and eruption detection, encompassing
diverse volcanoes worldwide. The dataset provides binary annotations to
identify volcanic anomalies or non-anomalies, covering phenomena such as
temperature anomalies, eruptions, and volcanic ash emissions. These annotations
offer a foundational resource for developing and evaluating detection models,
addressing a critical gap in volcanic monitoring research. Additionally, we
present comprehensive benchmarks using state-of-the-art models to establish
baselines for future studies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for
deploying these models onboard next-generation satellites. Using the Intel
Movidius Myriad X VPU as a testbed, we demonstrate the feasibility of volcanic
activity detection directly onboard. This capability significantly reduces
latency and enhances response times, paving the way for advanced early warning
systems. This paves the way for innovative solutions in volcanic disaster
management, encouraging further exploration and refinement of onboard
monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Subgraph matching is vital in knowledge graph (KG) question answering,
molecule design, scene graph, code and circuit search, etc. Neural methods have
shown promising results for subgraph matching. Our study of recent systems
suggests refactoring them into a unified design space for graph matching
networks. Existing methods occupy only a few isolated patches in this space,
which remains largely uncharted. We undertake the first comprehensive
exploration of this space, featuring such axes as attention-based vs. soft
permutation-based interaction between query and corpus graphs, aligning nodes
vs. edges, and the form of the final scoring network that integrates neural
representations of the graphs. Our extensive experiments reveal that judicious
and hitherto-unexplored combinations of choices in this space lead to large
performance benefits. Beyond better performance, our study uncovers valuable
insights and establishes general design principles for neural graph
representation and interaction, which may be of wider interest.

Abstract: We investigate the role of network architecture in shaping the inductive
biases of modern score-based generative models. To this end, we introduce the
Score Anisotropy Directions (SADs), architecture-dependent directions that
reveal how different networks preferentially capture data structure. Our
analysis shows that SADs form adaptive bases aligned with the architecture's
output geometry, providing a principled way to predict generalization ability
in score models prior to training. Through both synthetic data and standard
image benchmarks, we demonstrate that SADs reliably capture fine-grained model
behavior and correlate with downstream performance, as measured by Wasserstein
metrics. Our work offers a new lens for explaining and predicting directional
biases of generative models.

Result: 在四个不同维度的数据集上，SSBA方法在L2范数距离上比现有方法减少了5%到50%，能够处理现实约束，运行时间比基于网格的方法快多个数量级。

Conclusion: SSBA提供了一种简单有效的模型无关方法，能够计算最近可行的反事实解释，适用于高维空间和现实约束场景。

Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual
explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting
our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints
on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation)
from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many
discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible
counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Segmented
Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find
decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point.
Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can
outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in
distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can
also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and
categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related
characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of
runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple
orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based
approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic
method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints)
counterfactual explanations. All of our results and our code can be found here

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been extended to language generation through
Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), which achieve performance competitive
with strong autoregressive models. However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the
few-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation
methods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic
property of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models
(USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still
suffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we
propose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only
noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level
performance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we
introduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired
negative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in
generation quality.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor
readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing
methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture
intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a
novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection,
diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference
time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict
noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without
reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical
foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score
function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural
Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively
captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch
architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for
scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability,
provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency.
Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images
demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its
generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its
adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical
applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.

Conclusion: 提出的自适应拒绝和非交换性共形预测框架成功解决了持续领域预训练中LLMs的统计可靠性问题

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) is essential for enabling self-evolving large
language models (LLMs) to adapt and remain effective amid rapid knowledge
growth. Yet, despite its importance, little attention has been given to
establishing statistical reliability guarantees for LLMs under CL, particularly
in the setting of continual domain pretraining (CDP). Conformal Prediction (CP)
has shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for LLMs, but it faces
major challenges in CDP: testing data often stems from unknown or shifting
domain distributions, under which CP may no longer provide valid guarantees.
Moreover, when high coverage is required, CP can yield excessively large
prediction sets for unanswerable queries, reducing informativeness. To address
these challenges, we introduce an adaptive rejection and non-exchangeable CP
framework. Our method first estimates the distribution of questions across
domains in the test set using transformer-based clustering, then reweights or
resamples the calibration data accordingly. Building on this, adaptive
rejection CP allows the LLM to selectively abstain from answering when its
confidence or competence shifts significantly. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability
of CP under CDP scenarios. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 强化学习是动态生成辅助任务的有效方法，可以同时学习辅助任务标签和每个样本的辅助任务权重，并取得优异结果。

Abstract: Auxiliary Learning (AL) is a special case of Multi-task Learning (MTL) in
which a network trains on auxiliary tasks to improve performance on its main
task. This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately,
performance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve
performance across multiple domains, including navigation, image
classification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need
for labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain
expertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this
issue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can
create helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques
rely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased
code complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an
RL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an
RL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a
training set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the
performance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal
strategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass
CIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and
performs as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight
learning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For
example, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve
80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved
75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to
dynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample
auxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and
can achieve strong results.

Abstract: Compounding climate hazards, such as wildfire-induced outages and urban
heatwaves, challenge the stability and equity of cities. We present a
Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin (H-RDT) that combines physics-informed neural
network modeling, multimodal data fusion, and equity-aware risk analytics for

reinforcement learning based fusion module adaptively reweights IoT, UAV, and
satellite inputs to sustain spatiotemporal coverage, while the equity-adjusted
mapping isolates high-vulnerability clusters (schools, clinics, low-income
housing). Prospective interventions, such as preemptive cooling-center
activation and microgrid sharing, reduce population-weighted thermal risk by 11
to 13 percent, shrink the 95th-percentile (tail) risk by 7 to 17 percent, and
cut overheating hours by up to 9 percent. Beyond the synthetic demonstration,
the framework establishes a transferable foundation for real-city
implementation, linking physical hazard modeling with social equity and
decision intelligence. The H-RDT advances digital urban resilience toward
adaptive, learning-based, and equity-centered decision support for climate
adaptation.

*Paul Schwerdtner,Jules Berman,Benjamin Peherstorfer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过汉克尔奇异值正则化来压缩状态空间模型的方法，使模型在保持高精度的同时可压缩性提升10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于状态空间模型的深度神经网络虽然擅长处理长序列任务，但训练后难以压缩。

Method: 通过正则化状态空间模型的汉克尔奇异值之和，利用系统矩阵的块对角结构高效计算汉克尔奇异值。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中，正则化的状态空间层比标准状态空间层压缩性提升10倍，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: 汉克尔奇异值正则化是实现状态空间模型高效压缩的有效方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks using state space models as layers are well suited for
long-range sequence tasks but can be challenging to compress after training. We
use that regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values of state space models
leads to a fast decay of these singular values and thus to compressible models.
To make the proposed Hankel singular value regularization scalable, we develop
an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training
iterations by exploiting the specific block-diagonal structure of the system
matrices that is we use in our state space model parametrization. Experiments
on Long Range Arena benchmarks demonstrate that the regularized state space
layers are up to 10$\times$ more compressible than standard state space layers
while maintaining high accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑流形几何的核对齐方法MKA，相比传统的CKA方法更稳健


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的中心核对齐(CKA)方法不考虑底层流形结构，且依赖多种启发式方法，在不同数据规模下表现不一致

Method: 提出了流形近似核对齐(MKA)，将流形几何融入对齐任务，并建立了理论框架

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界示例上的实证评估表明，流形感知的核对齐为表示度量提供了更稳健的基础

Conclusion: MKA方法在表示学习等领域具有潜在应用价值

Abstract: Centered kernel alignment (CKA) is a popular metric for comparing
representations, determining equivalence of networks, and neuroscience
research. However, CKA does not account for the underlying manifold and relies
on numerous heuristics that cause it to behave differently at different scales
of data. In this work, we propose Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA),
which incorporates manifold geometry into the alignment task. We derive a
theoretical framework for MKA. We perform empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world examples to characterize and compare MKA to its
contemporaries. Our findings suggest that manifold-aware kernel alignment
provides a more robust foundation for measuring representations, with potential
applications in representation learning.

*Junhao Fan,Wenrui Liang,Wei-Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SARNet是一种基于现代时序卷积网络的剩余使用寿命预测框架，通过尖峰感知检测提供物理可解释性，在故障起始阶段表现更稳健，误差更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RUL预测模型在故障起始阶段表现脆弱且缺乏可解释性：短时高能尖峰被平滑或误读，固定阈值降低灵敏度，物理解释稀缺。

Method: 基于ModernTCN预测退化敏感指标，采用自适应连续阈值验证真实尖峰并抑制噪声，对故障易发段进行针对性特征工程，最后使用堆叠RF-LGBM回归器生成RUL。

Result: 在基准数据集的事件触发协议下，SARNet相比近期基线持续降低误差（RMSE 0.0365，MAE 0.0204），同时保持轻量、稳健且易于部署。

Conclusion: SARNet通过尖峰感知检测和物理信息可解释性，在RUL预测中实现了更高的准确性和鲁棒性，为系统可靠性提升和维护风险降低提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is essential to enhance
system reliability and reduce maintenance risk. Yet many strong contemporary
models are fragile around fault onset and opaque to engineers: short,
high-energy spikes are smoothed away or misread, fixed thresholds blunt
sensitivity, and physics-based explanations are scarce. To remedy this, we
introduce SARNet (Spike-Aware Consecutive Validation Framework), which builds
on a Modern Temporal Convolutional Network (ModernTCN) and adds spike-aware
detection to provide physics-informed interpretability. ModernTCN forecasts
degradation-sensitive indicators; an adaptive consecutive threshold validates
true spikes while suppressing noise. Failure-prone segments then receive
targeted feature engineering (spectral slopes, statistical derivatives, energy
ratios), and the final RUL is produced by a stacked RF--LGBM regressor. Across
benchmark-ported datasets under an event-triggered protocol, SARNet
consistently lowers error compared to recent baselines (RMSE 0.0365, MAE
0.0204) while remaining lightweight, robust, and easy to deploy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现增强大型语言模型的推理能力会因果性地增加工具幻觉，这种效应与训练方法无关且难以缓解，揭示了当前推理增强方法在可靠性与能力之间的根本性权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有观察发现推理能力增强与幻觉增加存在矛盾，但缺乏系统研究来确认推理增强是否直接导致工具幻觉。

Method: 构建SimpleToolHalluBench诊断基准，通过控制实验研究推理增强对工具幻觉的影响，评估包括RL训练、监督微调和推理时思维链切换等方法。

Result: 推理增强与工具幻觉存在因果正相关关系，这种效应超越过拟合，方法无关且难以缓解，缓解策略会降低模型效用。

Conclusion: 当前推理增强方法本质上会放大工具幻觉，需要开发能同时优化能力和可靠性的新训练目标。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key
strategy for building Agents that "think then act." However, recent
observations, like OpenAI's o3, suggest a paradox: stronger reasoning often
coincides with increased hallucination, yet no prior work has systematically
examined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination. To
address this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning
increase tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,
a diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)
no tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled
experiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal
relationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool
hallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect
transcends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still
amplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,
appearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is
merely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step
thinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering
and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental
reliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades
utility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses
tool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as
amplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These
findings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify
tool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that
jointly optimize for capability and reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了谱梯度下降(SpecGD)等谱感知矩阵优化器在深度学习中的泛化特性，特别是在数据不平衡情况下相比传统欧几里得梯度下降(GD)的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Muon和Shampoo等谱感知矩阵优化器在深度学习中的广泛应用，需要系统研究其泛化特性，特别是何时能超越竞争算法。

Method: 使用不平衡数据作为测试平台，研究谱梯度下降(SpecGD)的规范形式，并在高斯混合数据模型和线性/双线性模型中进行理论分析，扩展到深度线性模型。

Result: 研究发现SpecGD能平等学习数据的所有主成分，而GD优先学习主导主成分。这导致SpecGD在训练早期获得更好的平衡准确率，且深度会放大这种效应。

Conclusion: 谱优化器通过促进数据底层组件的更平衡学习，实现了优于传统优化器的泛化性能，这一发现在各种不平衡数据集上得到了实验验证。

Abstract: The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon
and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their
generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform
competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate
simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a
testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is
Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\Sigma
V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we
identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD
outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both
linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning
dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal
components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a
growing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further
show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive
step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,
we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our
theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments
compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against
their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that
these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more
balanced learning of the data's underlying components.

TL;DR: 提出QoSMGAA架构，通过多阶注意力机制和对抗神经网络提升QoS预测精度，在稀疏和噪声数据环境下表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络服务数量激增导致相似服务选择困难，现有QoS预测方法难以捕捉丰富上下文信息且在数据稀疏和结构噪声下性能不佳

Method: 集成多阶注意力机制聚合上下文数据，使用对抗神经网络进行自回归监督学习，采用Gumbel-Softmax离散采样技术生成负样本

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上的实验验证表明，该模型显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: QoSMGAA在复杂噪声网络服务环境中具有实际部署潜力，适用于服务选择和推荐场景

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of internet technologies, network services have
become critical for delivering diverse and reliable applications to users.
However, the exponential growth in the number of available services has
resulted in many similar offerings, posing significant challenges in selecting
optimal services. Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) accurately thus becomes a
fundamental prerequisite for ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.
However, existing QoS prediction methods often fail to capture rich contextual
information and exhibit poor performance under extreme data sparsity and
structural noise. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture, QoSMGAA,
specifically designed to enhance prediction accuracy in complex and noisy
network service environments. QoSMGAA integrates a multi-order attention
mechanism to aggregate extensive contextual data and predict missing QoS values
effectively. Additionally, our method incorporates adversarial neural networks
to perform autoregressive supervised learning based on transformed interaction
matrices. To capture complex, higher-order interactions among users and
services, we employ a discrete sampling technique leveraging the Gumbel-Softmax
method to generate informative negative samples. Comprehensive experimental
validation conducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrates that our
proposed model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods,
highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment in service selection
and recommendation scenarios.

Motivation: 现有等变模型大多局限于简单对称性（如旋转），无法处理科学领域中常见的更广泛的一般线性变换GL(n)。

Method: 引入伴随不变双线性层，实现对李代数特征和矩阵值输入的稳定等变性，无需为每个子群重新设计。

Result: 在sl(3)和sp(4)对称性的代数基准测试中优于现有方法，在洛伦兹等变粒子物理任务中获得竞争性结果，在3D无人机状态估计中显著提高轨迹精度。

Conclusion: ReLNs为在李代数和矩阵值数据上学习广泛线性群对称性提供了一个实用且通用的框架。

Abstract: Encoding symmetries is a powerful inductive bias for improving the
generalization of deep neural networks. However, most existing equivariant
models are limited to simple symmetries like rotations, failing to address the
broader class of general linear transformations, GL(n), that appear in many
scientific domains. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural
network architecture exactly equivariant to these general linear symmetries.
ReLNs are designed to operate directly on a wide range of structured inputs,
including general n-by-n matrices. ReLNs introduce a novel adjoint-invariant
bilinear layer to achieve stable equivariance for both Lie-algebraic features
and matrix-valued inputs, without requiring redesign for each subgroup. This
architecture overcomes the limitations of prior equivariant networks that only
apply to compact groups or simple vector data. We validate ReLNs' versatility
across a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic
benchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a
Lorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with
geometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances,
yielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy. ReLNs provide a
practical and general framework for learning with broad linear group symmetries
on Lie algebras and matrix-valued data. Project page:

Abstract: Random Forests (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are two of the
most widely used and highly performing classification and regression models.
They aggregate equally weighted CART trees, generated randomly in RF or
sequentially in XGBoost. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Forests (AF), a
novel approach that adaptively selects the weights of the underlying CART
models. AF combines (a) the Optimal Predictive-Policy Trees (OP2T) framework to
prescribe tailored, input-dependent unequal weights to trees and (b) Mixed
Integer Optimization (MIO) to refine weight candidates dynamically, enhancing
overall performance. We demonstrate that AF consistently outperforms RF,
XGBoost, and other weighted RF in binary and multi-class classification
problems over 20+ real-world datasets.

Motivation: 研究语言模型执行组合任务的能力，这些任务需要将上下文示例中展示的基本技能组合起来，这比标准设置更具挑战性。

Method: 对多个开源语言模型进行系统实验，使用语言和逻辑任务来探测组合能力，并进行理论分析。

Result: 简单任务示例对性能有负面影响，模型难以正确识别和组装技能，即使使用思维链示例也是如此。理论分析表明示例与组合步骤的对齐至关重要。

Conclusion: 提出了一种改进的探测任务方法，其性能提升为研究见解提供了积极支持，强调了示例与组合步骤对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Composing basic skills from simple tasks to accomplish composite tasks is
crucial for modern intelligent systems. We investigate the in-context
composition ability of language models to perform composite tasks that combine
basic skills demonstrated in in-context examples. This is more challenging than
the standard setting, where skills and their composition can be learned in
training. We conduct systematic experiments on various representative
open-source language models, utilizing linguistic and logical tasks designed to
probe composition abilities. The results reveal that simple task examples can
have a surprising negative impact on the performance, because the models
generally struggle to recognize and assemble the skills correctly, even with
Chain-of-Thought examples. Theoretical analysis further shows that it is
crucial to align examples with the corresponding steps in the composition. This
inspires a method for the probing tasks, whose improved performance provides
positive support for our insights.

TL;DR: 本文证明了softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数(p≥1)下具有统一的1/2Lipschitz常数，比传统认为的1更精确，这直接改进了现有关于鲁棒性和收敛性的理论结果。


<details>

Motivation: 现有机器学习模型和优化算法的鲁棒性保证与收敛性分析通常假设softmax算子的Lipschitz常数为1，但这一假设可能不够精确，限制了理论分析的紧致性。

Method: 通过理论分析证明softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数(p≥1)下的Lipschitz常数均为1/2，并验证了该常数在p=1和p=∞时的可达性。

Result: 证明了softmax函数具有统一的1/2Lipschitz常数，该结果在注意力架构(ViT、GPT-2、Qwen3-8B)和强化学习的随机策略上得到了实证验证。

Conclusion: softmax函数在所有ℓ_p范数下具有1/2的Lipschitz常数，这一更精确的常数能够直接改进现有关于鲁棒性和收敛性的理论结果。

Abstract: The softmax function is a basic operator in machine learning and
optimization, used in classification, attention mechanisms, reinforcement
learning, game theory, and problems involving log-sum-exp terms. Existing
robustness guarantees of learning models and convergence analysis of
optimization algorithms typically consider the softmax operator to have a
Lipschitz constant of $1$ with respect to the $\ell_2$ norm. In this work, we
prove that the softmax function is contractive with the Lipschitz constant
$1/2$, uniformly across all $\ell_p$ norms with $p \ge 1$. We also show that
the local Lipschitz constant of softmax attains $1/2$ for $p = 1$ and $p =
\infty$, and for $p \in (1,\infty)$, the constant remains strictly below $1/2$
and the supremum $1/2$ is achieved only in the limit. To our knowledge, this is
the first comprehensive norm-uniform analysis of softmax Lipschitz continuity.
We demonstrate how the sharper constant directly improves a range of existing
theoretical results on robustness and convergence. We further validate the
sharpness of the $1/2$ Lipschitz constant of the softmax operator through
empirical studies on attention-based architectures (ViT, GPT-2, Qwen3-8B) and
on stochastic policies in reinforcement learning.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的少样本知识图谱关系学习方法存在两个关键问题：一是孤立学习关系元知识，无法捕捉跨任务共享的通用关系模式；二是难以有效整合对快速适应至关重要的局部任务特定上下文。

Method: 提出MoEMeta框架，包含两个关键创新：(1)混合专家模型学习全局共享关系原型以增强泛化能力；(2)任务定制适应机制捕捉局部上下文以实现快速任务特定适应。

Result: 在三个知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验和分析表明，MoEMeta始终优于现有基线方法，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过平衡全局泛化与局部适应能力，MoEMeta显著推进了少样本关系学习的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph relational learning seeks to perform reasoning over
relations given only a limited number of training examples. While existing
approaches largely adopt a meta-learning framework for enabling fast adaptation
to new relations, they suffer from two key pitfalls. First, they learn relation
meta-knowledge in isolation, failing to capture common relational patterns
shared across tasks. Second, they struggle to effectively incorporate local,
task-specific contexts crucial for rapid adaptation. To address these
limitations, we propose MoEMeta, a novel meta-learning framework that
disentangles globally shared knowledge from task-specific contexts to enable
both effective generalization and rapid adaptation. MoEMeta introduces two key
innovations: (i) a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that learns globally shared
relational prototypes to enhance generalization, and (ii) a task-tailored
adaptation mechanism that captures local contexts for fast task-specific
adaptation. By balancing global generalization with local adaptability, MoEMeta
significantly advances few-shot relational learning. Extensive experiments and
analyses on three KG benchmarks demonstrate that MoEMeta consistently
outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习方法在IoT网络入侵检测中面临严重类别不平衡、非IID数据和通信开销大的挑战，导致性能下降。

Method: 采用双模型架构：个性化教师模型和轻量级共享学生模型，结合双向知识蒸馏、多层面特征对齐和类别平衡损失函数，服务器使用归一化梯度聚合。

Result: 在IoTID20和5GNIDD数据集上显著优于现有联邦学习方法，在极端数据异构情况下建立新的性能基准，同时保持通信效率。

Conclusion: Sentinel框架有效平衡了深度本地适应与高效全局模型共识，在保护客户端隐私的同时降低了通信成本，为联邦入侵检测系统提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for machine
learning, but its application in intrusion detection systems (IDS) within IoT
networks is challenged by severe class imbalance, non-IID data, and high
communication overhead.These challenges severely degrade the performance of
conventional FL methods in real-world network traffic classification. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Sentinel, a personalized federated IDS
(pFed-IDS) framework that incorporates a dual-model architecture on each
client, consisting of a personalized teacher and a lightweight shared student
model. This design effectively balances deep local adaptation with efficient
global model consensus while preserving client privacy by transmitting only the
compact student model, thus reducing communication costs. Sentinel integrates
three key mechanisms to ensure robust performance: bidirectional knowledge
distillation with adaptive temperature scaling, multi-faceted feature
alignment, and class-balanced loss functions. Furthermore, the server employs
normalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness
and mitigate client drift. Extensive experiments on the IoTID20 and 5GNIDD
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Sentinel significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art federated methods, establishing a new performance benchmark,
especially under extreme data heterogeneity, while maintaining communication
efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have substantially improved
the training of large-scale language models, leading to significant gains in
generation quality and reasoning ability. However, most existing research
focuses on dense models, while RL training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures remains underexplored. To address the instability commonly
observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize
importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a
rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient
variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the
final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic
innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction
for efficient training of large-scale expert models.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and Approximate Kernel Density
Estimation (A-KDE) are fundamental problems at the core of modern machine
learning, with broad applications in data analysis, information systems, and
large-scale decision making. In massive and dynamic data streams, a central
challenge is to design compact sketches that preserve essential structural
properties of the data while enabling efficient queries.
  In this work, we develop new sketching algorithms that achieve sublinear
space and query time guarantees for both ANN and A-KDE for a dynamic stream of
data. For ANN in the streaming model, under natural assumptions, we design a
sublinear sketch that requires only $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\rho-\eta})$ memory by
storing only a sublinear ($n^{-\eta}$) fraction of the total inputs, where
$\rho$ is a parameter of the LSH family, and $0<\eta<1$. Our method supports
sublinear query time, batch queries, and extends to the more general Turnstile
model. While earlier works have focused on Exact NN, this is the first result
on ANN that achieves near-optimal trade-offs between memory size and
approximation error.
  Next, for A-KDE in the Sliding-Window model, we propose a sketch of size
$\mathcal{O}\left(RW \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon} - 1} \log^2 N\right)$,
where $R$ is the number of sketch rows, $W$ is the LSH range, $N$ is the window
size, and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error. This, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first theoretical sublinear sketch guarantee for A-KDE in the
Sliding-Window model.
  We complement our theoretical results with experiments on various real-world
datasets, which show that the proposed sketches are lightweight and achieve
consistently low error in practice.

Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：大语言模型擅长处理离散原子类型但难以处理连续特征，而扩散模型擅长建模连续变量但难以生成准确的原子组成。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 首先使用微调的大语言模型生成原子类型、原子坐标和晶格结构的中间表示，然后保留预测的原子类型，将原子坐标和晶格结构传递给预训练的等变扩散模型进行细化。

Result: 在多个基准任务和数据集上优于最先进的生成模型，在结构和组成有效性方面实现平衡性能，生成的材料更稳定和新颖，并具有强大的条件生成能力。

Conclusion: CrysLLMGen成功结合了LLM和扩散模型的互补优势，为晶体材料生成提供了有效的混合框架，能够生成满足用户定义约束的高质量材料。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in
designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely
on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each
with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but
often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice
parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous
variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic
compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework
that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary
strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first
employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom
types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted
atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a
pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks
and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance
in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more
stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models
Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities,
effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints. Code is

TL;DR: 本文揭示了强化学习中Pass@K目标优化的两种方法——直接REINFORCE风格方法和优势塑造技术——实际上是同一枚硬币的两面，通过逆向工程和奖励重塑建立了它们之间的等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调和强化学习中Pass@K目标优化的两种看似不同的方法：直接REINFORCE风格方法和优势塑造技术，揭示它们的内在联系。

Method: 通过逆向工程现有优势塑造算法，揭示它们隐式优化代理奖励；从代理奖励目标出发，提供推导现有和新优势塑造方法的简单方法。

Result: 证明了直接REINFORCE方法和优势塑造技术本质上是等价的，优势塑造方法隐式地优化了代理奖励，而代理奖励目标可以推导出优势塑造方法。

Conclusion: 这种视角为RLVR策略梯度优化提供了超越Pass@K原始动机的通用框架，统一了两种看似不同的优化方法。

Abstract: This note reconciles two seemingly distinct approaches to policy gradient
optimization for the Pass@K objective in reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards: (1) direct REINFORCE-style methods, and (2) advantage-shaping
techniques that directly modify GRPO. We show that these are two sides of the
same coin. By reverse-engineering existing advantage-shaping algorithms, we
reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards. We specifically
interpret practical ``hard-example up-weighting'' modifications to GRPO as
reward-level regularization. Conversely, starting from surrogate reward
objectives, we provide a simple recipe for deriving both existing and new
advantage-shaping methods. This perspective provides a lens for RLVR policy
gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of Pass@K.

TL;DR: SwiftTS是一个快速选择时间序列预训练模型的框架，通过历史数据集-模型性能对来预测模型在未见数据集上的表现，避免昂贵的全候选模型前向传播。


<details>

Motivation: 模型中心有众多预训练模型，通过逐个微调来识别最合适的模型非常耗时，需要一种高效的模型选择方法。

Method: 采用轻量级双编码器架构嵌入时间序列和候选模型特征，计算数据与模型嵌入之间的补丁兼容性分数；引入视界自适应专家组合模块动态调整专家权重，以及可迁移的跨任务学习增强OOD鲁棒性。

Result: 在14个下游数据集和8个预训练模型上的广泛实验表明，SwiftTS在时间序列预训练模型选择方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SwiftTS框架能够高效准确地选择时间序列预训练模型，显著减少了模型选择的时间成本。

Abstract: Pre-trained models exhibit strong generalization to various downstream tasks.
However, given the numerous models available in the model hub, identifying the
most suitable one by individually fine-tuning is time-consuming. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series
pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all
candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical
dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model
performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder
architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich
characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and
model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization
across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert
composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the
transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task
sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments
on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model
selection.

Conclusion: AirFed在大规模无人机-移动边缘计算部署中展现出强大的可扩展性和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing
(MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning,
task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service
(QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from
limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among
UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with
stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated
graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer
dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal
dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships
and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop
a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous
trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a
reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with
gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust
knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2%
IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%.
Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers,
IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical
applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.

Motivation: 开发一种无需目标分布样本或配分函数计算就能估计具体分数的采样方法，解决离散状态空间中的采样问题。

Method: 基于前向均匀扩散核的连续时间马尔可夫链，提出目标具体分数恒等式，用神经网络近似具体分数，开发了两种算法：自归一化TCSIS和无偏TCSIS。

Result: 在统计物理问题上验证了TCSIS的有效性，能够成功从未归一化密度中采样。

Conclusion: TCSIS提供了一种有效的离散状态空间采样方法，无需目标分布样本或配分函数计算，在统计物理应用中表现出良好性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Target Concrete Score Identity Sampler (TCSIS), a method for
sampling from unnormalized densities on discrete state spaces by learning the
reverse dynamics of a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC). Our approach builds
on a forward in time CTMC with a uniform noising kernel and relies on the
proposed Target Concrete Score Identity, which relates the concrete score, the
ratio of marginal probabilities of two states, to a ratio of expectations of
Boltzmann factors under the forward uniform diffusion kernel. This formulation
enables Monte Carlo estimation of the concrete score without requiring samples
from the target distribution or computation of the partition function. We
approximate the concrete score with a neural network and propose two
algorithms: Self-Normalized TCSIS and Unbiased TCSIS. Finally, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of TCSIS on problems from statistical physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点——神经算子性能受限于训练数据的精度，探索神经网络能否超越其训练数据源的精度限制

Method: 理论分析模拟器归纳偏置、训练目标和数值误差特性的相互作用，并在多种PDE上使用标准神经网络架构进行实证验证

Result: 发现神经网络模拟器能够隐式学习比训练数据更正则化的动力学特性，具有更有利的误差累积特性，从而在特定操作机制下超越训练数据源

Conclusion: 需要重新评估模拟器基准测试方法，神经模拟器可能在特定操作机制下实现比训练数据源更高的物理保真度

Abstract: Neural operators or emulators for PDEs trained on data from numerical solvers
are conventionally assumed to be limited by their training data's fidelity. We
challenge this assumption by identifying "emulator superiority," where neural
networks trained purely on low-fidelity solver data can achieve higher accuracy
than those solvers when evaluated against a higher-fidelity reference. Our
theoretical analysis reveals how the interplay between emulator inductive
biases, training objectives, and numerical error characteristics enables
superior performance during multi-step rollouts. We empirically validate this
finding across different PDEs using standard neural architectures,
demonstrating that emulators can implicitly learn dynamics that are more
regularized or exhibit more favorable error accumulation properties than their
training data, potentially surpassing training data limitations and mitigating
numerical artifacts. This work prompts a re-evaluation of emulator
benchmarking, suggesting neural emulators might achieve greater physical
fidelity than their training source within specific operational regimes.

Conclusion: 研究表明即使在数据有限的情况下，PINNs也能提供可靠的结构重量估计，有助于轻量级桥梁设计的早期失效分析。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their
ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly
useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to
explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti
bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure
modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates
physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In
addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics
Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function
approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided
as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision
methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and
our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based
interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can
offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may
help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.

Motivation: 现有异常值检测技术往往忽略领域对象的固有分散性，且大多基于纯数值分析，无法模拟人类专家的视觉识别方式。

Method: 基于聚类过程，设计了四个标准来模拟人类专家视觉识别异常值的方式，克服了传统聚类异常检测的纯数值分析局限性。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同领域中有效检测异常数据，具有高可靠性和低误报率，优于传统的聚类异常检测技术。

Abstract: Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas.
Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human
error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform
outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers
and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier
detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal
outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier
detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of
domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed
to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify
outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an
advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are
founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been
evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from
two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying
balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a
neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate
the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in
terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal
is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false
positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.

TL;DR: 本文从信息论角度重新解释了GSPO算法中的长度归一化重要性比率，建立了其与困惑度比率和交叉熵变化之间的数学等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为理解GSPO算法中序列级权重$s(\theta) = (\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$提供新的信息论视角，解释其经验特性。

Method: 通过数学推导建立GSPO序列级权重与困惑度比率$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$和指数交叉熵变化$\exp(\Delta H)$的等价关系，并在数学推理任务上进行受控实验验证。

Result: 成功证明了GSPO序列级权重可以等价表示为困惑度比率和交叉熵变化，这种信息论视角有助于解释GSPO的经验特性，包括通过几何平均实现的log域方差减少和在专家混合模型训练中的稳定性。

Conclusion: GSPO算法通过困惑度比率对策略梯度更新进行加权，提供了重要性权重的信息论解释，这一视角有助于更好地理解和改进强化学习算法。

Abstract: We provide a new perspective on GSPO's length-normalized importance ratios by
establishing their connection to information-theoretic quantities. We show that
GSPO's sequence-level weight $s(\theta) =
(\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$ can be equivalently expressed
as the inverse perplexity ratio
$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$ and as the exponential
cross-entropy change $\exp(\Delta H)$. While the perplexity-entropy
relationship follows from standard definitions, this observation provides a
useful lens for understanding GSPO: the algorithm weights policy gradient
updates by perplexity ratios, offering an information-theoretic interpretation
of the importance weights. This perspective helps explain GSPO's empirical
properties, including log-domain variance reduction through geometric averaging
and stability in training mixture-of-experts models. We validate the
mathematical equivalences and variance predictions through controlled
experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了感知-决策交错Transformer（PDiT）架构，通过在单个Transformer中交替感知和决策层，让决策反馈动态优化感知特征，并结合对比损失对齐文本任务嵌入与视觉场景特征，在BabyAI GoToLocal环境中表现优于标准PPO基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统架构将感知（如CNN视觉编码器）与决策（策略网络）分离，导致策略失败无法直接帮助感知模块学习重要内容，这种分离效率低下。

Method: 实现PDiT架构，在单个Transformer中交替感知和决策层；集成受CLIP启发的对比损失来对齐文本任务嵌入与视觉场景特征。

Result: 在BabyAI GoToLocal环境中评估，相比标准PPO基线，该方法获得更稳定的奖励和更强的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 交错Transformer编码器是开发更集成自主智能体的有前景方向。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents often struggle when tasks require
understanding both vision and language. Conventional architectures typically
isolate perception (for example, CNN-based visual encoders) from
decision-making (policy networks). This separation can be inefficient, since
the policy's failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is
important. To address this, we implement the Perception-Decision Interleaving
Transformer (PDiT) architecture introduced by Mao et al. (2023), a model that
alternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer.
This interleaving allows feedback from decision-making to refine perceptual
features dynamically. In addition, we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by
CLIP to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features. We
evaluate the PDiT encoders on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment and find that
the approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a
standard PPO baseline. The results suggest that interleaved transformer
encoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous
agents.

Motivation: 智能家居接口需求增长，现有振动手势识别方法依赖复杂预处理和大规模神经网络，导致高能耗且难以在实际中部署。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了低延迟、高能效的实时手势识别，适合长期边缘操作，为智能家居应用提供了可行的部署方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for smart home interfaces has increased interest in
non-intrusive sensing methods like vibration-based gesture recognition. While
prior studies demonstrated feasibility, they often rely on complex
preprocessing and large Neural Networks (NNs) requiring costly high-performance
hardware, resulting in high energy usage and limited real-world deployability.
This study proposes an energy-efficient solution deploying compact NNs on
low-power Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to enable real-time gesture
recognition with competitive accuracy. We adopt a series of optimizations: (1)
We replace complex spectral preprocessing with raw waveform input, eliminating
complex on-board preprocessing while reducing input size by 21x without
sacrificing accuracy. (2) We design two lightweight architectures (1D-CNN and
1D-SepCNN) tailored for embedded FPGAs, reducing parameters from 369 million to
as few as 216 while maintaining comparable accuracy. (3) With integer-only
quantization and automated RTL generation, we achieve seamless FPGA deployment.
A ping-pong buffering mechanism in 1D-SepCNN further improves deployability
under tight memory constraints. (4) We extend a hardware-aware search framework
to support constraint-driven model configuration selection, considering
accuracy, deployability, latency, and energy consumption. Evaluated on two
swipe-direction datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables, our approach
achieves low-latency, energy-efficient inference on the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S25
FPGA. Under the PS data splitting setting, the selected 6-bit 1D-CNN reaches
0.970 average accuracy across users with 9.22 ms latency. The chosen 8-bit
1D-SepCNN further reduces latency to 6.83 ms (over 53x CPU speedup) with
slightly lower accuracy (0.949). Both consume under 1.2 mJ per inference,
demonstrating suitability for long-term edge operation.

Motivation: 预测基准测试在机器学习研究中日益重要，但仅凭基准分数无法直接支持科学推断，需要明确评估数据集、学习问题和数据分布的理论结构假设。

Method: 基于心理测量理论开发构建效度条件，并通过ImageNet、WeatherBench和Fragile Families Challenge三个案例研究检验这些假设。

Result: 框架明确了基准分数支持不同科学主张的条件，揭示了预测基准测试作为认识论实践的重要性。

Conclusion: 预测基准测试需要明确的构建效度条件才能有效支持科学推断，这是机器学习中概念和理论推理的关键环节。

Abstract: Predictive benchmarking, the evaluation of machine learning models based on
predictive performance and competitive ranking, is a central epistemic practice
in machine learning research and an increasingly prominent method for
scientific inquiry. Yet, benchmark scores alone provide at best measurements of
model performance relative to an evaluation dataset and a concrete learning
problem. Drawing substantial scientific inferences from the results, say about
theoretical tasks like image classification, requires additional assumptions
about the theoretical structure of the learning problems, evaluation functions,
and data distributions. We make these assumptions explicit by developing
conditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory.
We examine these assumptions in practice through three case studies, each
exemplifying a typical intended inference: measuring engineering progress in
computer vision with ImageNet; evaluating policy-relevant weather predictions
with WeatherBench; and examining limitations of the predictability of life
events with the Fragile Families Challenge. Our framework clarifies the
conditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,
bringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological
practice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续预训练缩放定律通常假设固定的预训练预算，限制了它们预测在不同tokens-per-parameter下模型自适应结果的能力。

Method: 开发PTPP感知的自适应缩放定律，将预训练预算作为显式变量，并在多语言设置（英语/阿拉伯语→法语）上进行验证。

Result: 在PTPP=279时，基于早期阶段训练的PTPP感知公式能够准确预测目标损失，并在多个指标上优于PTPP无关的基线方法。

Conclusion: PTPP感知缩放定律不仅能准确预测自适应损失，还可用于在计算限制下规划重放比例和自适应token预算以满足目标和遗忘约束。

Abstract: Continual pre-training (CPT) for domain adaptation must balance target-domain
gains with stability on the base domain. Existing CPT scaling laws typically
assume a fixed pre-training budget, which limits their ability to forecast
adaptation outcomes for models trained at different tokens-per-parameter
(PTPP). We present \emph{PTPP-aware} adaptation scaling laws that make the
pre-training budget an explicit variable, enabling accurate \emph{prediction}
of adaptation loss at unseen \ptpp. On a multilingual setup (English/Arabic
$\rightarrow$ French), PTPP-aware formulations trained on early stages
(\ptpp{}=\{15,31\}) predict target loss at \ptpp{}=279 and outperform a
PTPP-agnostic \dcpt{} transfer baseline on metrics (Huber-on-log,
MAE$_\mathrm{rel}$, calibration slope); full diagnostics (RMSE, MAPE) are in
the appendix. Beyond forecasting, we show a practical use case: planning replay
ratios and adaptation token budgets that satisfy target and forgetting
constraints under compute limits.

Motivation: 现有代码生成数据集大多只包含问题与解决方案的配对，缺乏指导编码过程的中间推理步骤，限制了模型学习问题解决过程的能力。

Method: 结合四个关键组件：精选竞赛问题、通过相关性分类器筛选的网络挖掘内容、基于推理模式的数据扩展、多阶段执行验证，并使用遗传变异算法增加任务多样性。

Result: 在该数据集上微调的LLM在编码基准测试中表现一致提升，推理感知数据可以替代模型扩展，在不同架构间泛化，并在相同样本预算下优于领先的开源替代方案。

Conclusion: 以推理为中心的合成数据生成是提升LLM编码能力的高效方法，发布了数据集和生成管道以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive promise in code
generation, yet their progress remains limited by the shortage of large-scale
datasets that are both diverse and well-aligned with human reasoning. Most
existing resources pair problems with solutions, but omit the intermediate
thought process that guides coding. To close this gap, we present a scalable
synthetic data generation pipeline that produces nearly 800k
instruction-reasoning-code-test quadruplets. Each sample combines a task, a
step-by-step reasoning trace, a working solution, and executable tests,
enabling models to learn not just the what but also the how of problem solving.
Our pipeline combines four key components: curated contest problems, web-mined
content filtered by relevance classifiers, data expansion guided by reasoning
patterns, and multi-stage execution-based validation. A genetic mutation
algorithm further increases task diversity while maintaining consistency
between reasoning traces and code implementations. Our key finding is that
fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset yields consistent improvements on coding
benchmarks. Beyond raw accuracy, reasoning-aware data can substitute for model
scaling, generalize across architectures, and outperform leading open-source
alternatives under identical sample budgets. Our work establishes
reasoning-centered synthetic data generation as an efficient approach for
advancing coding capabilities in LLMs. We publish our dataset and generation
pipeline to facilitate further research.

*Hong Wang,Jie Wang,Jian Luo,huanshuo dong,Yeqiu Chen,Runmin Jiang,Zhen huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCSF的新方法，通过利用算子之间的相似性来加速特征值数据生成，相比传统数值求解器可实现3.5倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络特征值方法需要大量带标签数据（算子和特征值）进行训练，数据生成成本高昂。现有方法忽略了算子之间的相似性这一重要因素。

Method: 使用截断快速傅里叶变换排序将具有相似特征值分布的算子分组，构建切比雪夫子空间滤波器，利用先前已解决问题的特征对来辅助解决后续问题，减少冗余计算。

Result: 实验结果显示，SCSF相比各种数值求解器实现了最高3.5倍的加速。

Conclusion: SCSF是首个加速特征值数据生成的方法，通过利用算子相似性显著提高了数据生成效率。

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific
disciplines. With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural
eigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of
inference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to
traditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large
amounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.
To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev
Subspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data
generation by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked
by existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier
transform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and
constructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from
previously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing
redundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method
to accelerate eigenvalue data generation. Experimental results show that SCSF
achieves up to a $3.5\times$ speedup compared to various numerical solvers.

TL;DR: 提出基于Grassmann流形上黎曼插值的低通图滤波器插值算法，用于参数化图族，避免重复求解特征值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数化图族的低通滤波器计算成本高昂，需要重复求解特征值问题来获取低频子空间。

Method: 在Grassmann流形上使用法坐标进行黎曼插值，推导子空间插值的误差界估计。

Result: 提出了两种应用：通过相似性校正将节点特征时间演化转化为图拓扑演化；基于静态图诱导点积图族改进消息传递方案。

Conclusion: 黎曼插值方法能有效降低参数化图族低通滤波器计算成本，并支持图拓扑演化和消息传递方案的改进。

Abstract: Low-pass graph filters are fundamental for signal processing on graphs and
other non-Euclidean domains. However, the computation of such filters for
parametric graph families can be prohibitively expensive as computation of the
corresponding low-frequency subspaces, requires the repeated solution of an
eigenvalue problem. We suggest a novel algorithm of low-pass graph filter
interpolation based on Riemannian interpolation in normal coordinates on the
Grassmann manifold. We derive an error bound estimate for the subspace
interpolation and suggest two possible applications for induced parametric
graph families. First, we argue that the temporal evolution of the node
features may be translated to the evolving graph topology via a similarity
correction to adjust the homophily degree of the network. Second, we suggest a
dot product graph family induced by a given static graph which allows to infer
improved message passing scheme for node classification facilitated by the
filter interpolation.

### [391] [Robust Iterative Learning Hidden Quantum Markov Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23237)
*Ning Ning*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了对抗性损坏的隐量子马尔可夫模型（AC-HQMM）和鲁棒迭代学习算法（RILA），用于在数据损坏情况下实现鲁棒的量子序列学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐量子马尔可夫模型学习算法对数据损坏高度敏感，缺乏在对抗性扰动下确保鲁棒性的机制

Method: 提出AC-HQMM框架，允许控制比例的观测序列被对抗性损坏；开发RILA算法，集成基于熵过滤的去除损坏行模块和迭代随机重采样过程，使用L1惩罚似然目标增强稳定性

Result: 在多个HQMM和HMM基准测试中，RILA表现出优越的收敛稳定性、损坏恢复能力和物理有效性保持

Conclusion: 建立了一种原则性且高效的方法，用于实现鲁棒的量子序列学习

Abstract: Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) extend classical Hidden Markov Models to
the quantum domain, offering a powerful probabilistic framework for modeling
sequential data with quantum coherence. However, existing HQMM learning
algorithms are highly sensitive to data corruption and lack mechanisms to
ensure robustness under adversarial perturbations. In this work, we introduce
the Adversarially Corrupted HQMM (AC-HQMM), which formalizes robustness
analysis by allowing a controlled fraction of observation sequences to be
adversarially corrupted. To learn AC-HQMMs, we propose the Robust Iterative
Learning Algorithm (RILA), a derivative-free method that integrates a Remove
Corrupted Rows by Entropy Filtering (RCR-EF) module with an iterative
stochastic resampling procedure for physically valid Kraus operator updates.
RILA incorporates L1-penalized likelihood objectives to enhance stability,
resist overfitting, and remain effective under non-differentiable conditions.
Across multiple HQMM and HMM benchmarks, RILA demonstrates superior convergence
stability, corruption resilience, and preservation of physical validity
compared to existing algorithms, establishing a principled and efficient
approach for robust quantum sequential learning.

*Qi Li,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GCAO聚类算法，通过群体级优化机制聚合低密度边界点，结合引力相互作用提升聚类稳定性，在高维数据上显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法在高维和非均匀分布数据中表现不佳，低密度边界样本易受邻近簇干扰，导致聚类结果不稳定和扭曲。

Method: 引入群体级优化机制，将低密度边界点聚合成协作移动的群体；结合局部密度估计和邻域拓扑构建群体与周围环境的引力相互作用；使用群体作为基本运动单元，采用引力收缩策略确保全局稳定收敛。

Result: 在多个高维数据集上优于11种代表性聚类方法，NMI、ARI、Homogeneity和ACC分别平均提升37.13%、52.08%、44.98%和38.81%，同时保持竞争性的效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: GCAO在保持簇完整性、增强边界可分性和确保复杂数据分布上的鲁棒性能方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional and
non-uniformly distributed data, where low-density boundary samples are easily
disturbed by neighboring clusters, leading to unstable and distorted clustering
results. To address this issue, we propose a Group-driven Clustering via
Gravitational Attraction and Optimization (GCAO) algorithm. GCAO introduces a
group-level optimization mechanism that aggregates low-density boundary points
into collaboratively moving groups, replacing the traditional point-based
contraction process. By combining local density estimation with neighborhood
topology, GCAO constructs effective gravitational interactions between groups
and their surroundings, enhancing boundary clarity and structural consistency.
Using groups as basic motion units, a gravitational contraction strategy
ensures globally stable and directionally consistent convergence. Experiments
on multiple high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that GCAO outperforms 11
representative clustering methods, achieving average improvements of 37.13%,
52.08%, 44.98%, and 38.81% in NMI, ARI, Homogeneity, and ACC, respectively,
while maintaining competitive efficiency and scalability. These results
highlight GCAO's superiority in preserving cluster integrity, enhancing
boundary separability, and ensuring robust performance on complex data
distributions.

### [393] [Toward Interpretable Evaluation Measures for Time Series Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23261)
*Félix Chavelli,Paul Boniol,Michaël Thomazo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的时间序列分割评估指标WARI和SMS，解决了现有评估方法在捕捉分割质量、错误类型和可解释性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割评估方法主要关注变化点准确性或使用基于点的度量（如ARI），无法充分评估分割质量、忽略错误性质且可解释性有限。

Method: 提出了WARI（加权调整兰德指数），考虑分割错误的位置；以及SMS（状态匹配分数），细粒度识别并评分四种基本分割错误类型，支持错误特定加权。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中验证了WARI和SMS，证明它们不仅提供更准确的分割质量评估，还能揭示传统方法无法获取的错误来源和类型等洞察。

Conclusion: WARI和SMS为时间序列分割提供了更全面、可解释的评估框架，能够更好地理解和改进分割算法的性能。

Abstract: Time series segmentation is a fundamental task in analyzing temporal data
across various domains, from human activity recognition to energy monitoring.
While numerous state-of-the-art methods have been developed to tackle this
problem, the evaluation of their performance remains critically limited.
Existing measures predominantly focus on change point accuracy or rely on
point-based measures such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which fail to capture
the quality of the detected segments, ignore the nature of errors, and offer
limited interpretability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by
introducing two novel evaluation measures: WARI (Weighted Adjusted Rand Index),
that accounts for the position of segmentation errors, and SMS (State Matching
Score), a fine-grained measure that identifies and scores four fundamental
types of segmentation errors while allowing error-specific weighting. We
empirically validate WARI and SMS on synthetic and real-world benchmarks,
showing that they not only provide a more accurate assessment of segmentation
quality but also uncover insights, such as error provenance and type, that are
inaccessible with traditional measures.

*Xinhai Wang,Shu Yang,Liangyu Wang,Lin Zhang,Huanyi Xie,Lijie Hu,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAHQ是一种加速自动电路发现的方法，通过逐注意力头量化优化单个修补操作的效率，在保持忠实度的同时显著降低运行时间和内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ACDC方法在大语言模型中存在计算效率低下和内存需求过高的问题，现有加速方法主要依赖线性近似，这会显著损害分析忠实度。

Method: PAHQ利用激活修补与混合精度量化的基本对齐原理，仅对调查组件保持高精度，同时安全降低网络中其他部分的精度，通过修改注意力计算机制实现训练自由的加速。

Result: PAHQ加速的ACDC相比未加速版本，运行时间减少高达80%，内存消耗降低高达30%，同时保持忠实度。

Conclusion: PAHQ为加速机制可解释性方法提供了一条实用且新颖的途径，能够与现有的基于边缘的电路发现技术无缝集成。

Abstract: Circuit discovery, which involves identifying sparse and task-relevant
subnetworks in pre-trained language models, is a cornerstone of mechanistic
interpretability. Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC) has emerged as a pivotal
methodology in circuit discovery, but its application to large language models
is severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory
requirements. Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they
primarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly
compromises analytical faithfulness. Our proposed method for accelerating
automated circuit discovery, Per Attention Head Quantization (PAHQ), takes a
fundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each
individual patching operation. PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between
activation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability
analysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies.
Therefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated
components while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network.
PAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\% and memory consumption by
up to 30\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness.
Importantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit
discovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism. This
training-free approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating
mechanistic interpretability methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAMPE是一个统一的多模态蛋白质嵌入框架，通过最优传输表示对齐和条件图生成融合方法，解决了蛋白质功能预测中的跨模态分布不匹配和噪声关系图问题，在标准GO基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质功能预测需要整合异质的内在信号（序列、结构）和噪声外在上下文（蛋白质相互作用、GO注释），但面临跨模态嵌入分布不匹配和噪声关系图影响GNN信息聚合的挑战。

Method: 提出DAMPE框架：1）基于最优传输的表示对齐，建立不同模态内在嵌入空间的对应关系；2）基于条件图生成的信息融合方法，通过条件编码器融合对齐后的内在嵌入来重建图结构。

Result: 在标准GO基准测试中，DAMPE优于或匹配DPFunc等最先进方法，AUPR提升0.002-0.013pp，Fmax提升0.004-0.007pp。消融研究表明OT对齐贡献0.043-0.064pp AUPR，CGG融合贡献0.005-0.111pp Fmax。

Conclusion: DAMPE提供了一个可扩展且理论基础的鲁棒多模态蛋白质表示学习方法，显著提升了蛋白质功能预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous
intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts
(e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key
challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch
among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy
relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information
aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding
(DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms.
First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that
establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different
modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we
develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method,
where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide
informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis
implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb
graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically,
DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on
standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains
0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment
contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp
Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for
robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing
protein function prediction.

### [396] [Learning from Frustration: Torsor CNNs on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23288)
*Daiyuan Li,Shreya Arya,Robert Ghrist*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Torsor CNNs框架，用于在具有局部对称性的图上学习，通过边势编码相邻坐标系之间的群值变换，解决了传统等变神经网络仅依赖全局对称性的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统等变神经网络依赖单一全局对称性，无法有效处理具有局部对称性的领域。本文旨在开发能够处理图上局部对称性的神经网络框架。

Method: 引入Torsor CNNs框架，使用边势（群值变换）编码局部对称性，提出Torsor卷积层（局部坐标框架变化的等变性）和挫折损失（几何正则化器）。

Result: 该框架统一并推广了多种架构（包括经典CNN和流形上的Gauge CNN），可在任意图上操作，无需全局坐标系或光滑流形结构。

Conclusion: Torsor CNNs为处理局部对称性提供了数学基础，并在多视角3D识别等应用中展示了实用性，其中相对相机姿态自然定义了所需的边势。

Abstract: Most equivariant neural networks rely on a single global symmetry, limiting
their use in domains where symmetries are instead local. We introduce Torsor
CNNs, a framework for learning on graphs with local symmetries encoded as edge
potentials -- group-valued transformations between neighboring coordinate
frames. We establish that this geometric construction is fundamentally
equivalent to the classical group synchronization problem, yielding: (1) a
Torsor Convolutional Layer that is provably equivariant to local changes in
coordinate frames, and (2) the frustration loss -- a standalone geometric
regularizer that encourages locally equivariant representations when added to
any NN's training objective. The Torsor CNN framework unifies and generalizes
several architectures -- including classical CNNs and Gauge CNNs on manifolds
-- by operating on arbitrary graphs without requiring a global coordinate
system or smooth manifold structure. We establish the mathematical foundations
of this framework and demonstrate its applicability to multi-view 3D
recognition, where relative camera poses naturally define the required edge
potentials.

Conclusion: 简单的均值聚合也能显著提升性能，MIO在符号ODE推断任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce MIO, a transformer-based model for inferring symbolic ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) from multiple observed trajectories of a
dynamical system. By combining multiple instance learning with
transformer-based symbolic regression, the model effectively leverages repeated
observations of the same system to learn more generalizable representations of
the underlying dynamics. We investigate different instance aggregation
strategies and show that even simple mean aggregation can substantially boost
performance. MIO is evaluated on systems ranging from one to four dimensions
and under varying noise levels, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

TL;DR: 该论文研究预测编码（PC）作为反向传播（BP）的替代算法，通过优化理论分析PC的学习动态，提出新的参数化方法μPC，首次实现100+层网络的稳定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播算法能耗高且不太可能在大脑中实现，预测编码作为更高效的脑启发算法具有潜力，但深层PC网络难以训练且其动态机制理解不足。

Method: 采用优化理论方法分析PC学习动态，将其理解为近似信任域方法；研究PC使用高阶信息的能力；基于推理动态研究提出新的μPC参数化方法。

Result: PC学习动态可近似为使用二阶信息的信任域方法；PC能利用高阶信息，学习景观比MSE损失景观更良性；μPC首次实现100+层网络稳定训练，在简单任务上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该论文显著推进了对PC网络推理和学习动态的基本理解，但PC要在大规模应用中与BP竞争，未来研究需要关注硬件协同设计。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the standard algorithm for training the deep neural
networks that power modern artificial intelligence including large language
models. However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the
brain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient
brain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks
(PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before
learning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative
inference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster
training. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the
inference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep
PCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards
scaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.
First, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an
approximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite
explicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this
approximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily
higher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective
landscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing
gradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a
study of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation
called ``$\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+
layer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks.
Overall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of
the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for
future research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at
scale.

Conclusion: GRAD作为自动驾驶系统中可靠高效的实时异常检测解决方案，能够保证车辆安全运行且计算开销最小。

Abstract: This paper introduces GRAD, a real-time anomaly detection method for
autonomous vehicle sensors that integrates statistical analysis and deep
learning to ensure the reliability of sensor data. The proposed approach
combines the Reinforced Exponential Moving Average (REMA), which adapts
smoothing factors and thresholding for outlier detection, with the Multi-Stage
Sliding Window (MS-SW) technique for capturing both short- and long-term
patterns. These features are processed using a lightweight Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) model, which detects and classifies anomalies based on bias types, while
a recovery module restores damaged sensor data to ensure continuous system
operation. GRAD has a lightweight architecture consisting of two layers of GRU
with a limited number of neurons that make it appropriate for real-time
applications while maintaining high detection accuracy. The GRAD framework
achieved remarkable performance in anomaly detection and classification. The
model demonstrated an overall F1-score of 97.6% for abnormal data and 99.4% for
normal data, signifying its high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and
anomalous sensor data. Regarding the anomaly classification, GRAD successfully
categorized different anomaly types with high precision, enabling the recovery
module to accurately restore damaged sensor data. Relative to analogous
studies, GRAD surpasses current models by attaining a balance between elevated
detection accuracy and diminished computational expense. These results
demonstrate GRAD's potential as a reliable and efficient solution for real-time
anomaly detection in autonomous vehicle systems, guaranteeing safe vehicle
operation with minimal computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决S-LoRA在服务多个LoRA适配器时的通信开销问题，该开销在理论上小但在实践中可能很大。

Method: 约束LoRA因子为块对角结构，从而允许无需额外通信的LoRA适配器分片策略。

Result: 在8个A100 GPU上，Llama-3.1-70B获得最高1.79倍端到端加速，参数数为0.87倍；Llama-3.1-8B获得最高1.63倍加速，参数数为0.86倍。

Conclusion: 块对角LoRA在保持与标准LoRA相似参数效率的同时，显著提升了服务效率，是S-LoRA的有效替代方案。

Abstract: When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters
simultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's
weights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using
different adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to
be separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the
LoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base
model's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA
sharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in
theory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain
certain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way
of sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication
for the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our
block-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA
(i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream
performance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA.
For example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x)
end-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for
Llama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x)
the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可学习Sigmoid算子的乘法更新近端梯度算法(SSO-PGA)，用于解决非负逆问题中传统PGA的收敛不稳定和违反非负约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统近端梯度算法在图像重建等逆问题中经常违反非负约束，导致收敛不稳定和次优解，其根本原因是梯度下降步骤会引入负值并对超参数高度敏感。

Method: 用可学习的Sigmoid算子替代梯度下降步骤，将减法更新转换为乘法更新，强制实施非负性和有界性；通过滑动参数增强稳定性和收敛性；将算法展开为深度网络结合优化可解释性和深度学习能力。

Result: 在广泛的数值和真实世界实验中，该方法显著超越了传统PGA和其他最先进算法，确保了优越的性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: SSO-PGA通过创新的乘法更新机制有效解决了非负逆问题中的约束违反和收敛不稳定问题，为结合优化理论和深度学习提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Proximal gradient algorithms (PGA), while foundational for inverse problems
like image reconstruction, often yield unstable convergence and suboptimal
solutions by violating the critical non-negativity constraint. We identify the
gradient descent step as the root cause of this issue, which introduces
negative values and induces high sensitivity to hyperparameters. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel multiplicative update proximal gradient
algorithm (SSO-PGA) with convergence guarantees, which is designed for
robustness in non-negative inverse problems. Our key innovation lies in
superseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,
which inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming
traditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones. This design,
augmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not
only improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise
immunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration
and derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded
into a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the
power of deep learning. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses traditional PGA and other
state-of-the-art algorithms, ensuring superior performance and stability.

Abstract: Flood susceptibility mapping (FSM) is vital for disaster prevention but
remains challenging in data-scarce regions where hydrodynamic models require
dense geophysical inputs. This work introduces ZeroFlood, a geospatial
foundation model framework for data-efficient FSM. The approach fine-tunes
Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) with Thinking-in-Modality (TiM) reasoning,
enabling flood prediction from basic Earth observation data such as Sentinel-1

regions, ZeroFlood bridges data availability gaps through cross-modal
representation learning. Experiments with TerraMind and Prithvi GFMs show that

TL;DR: GATE是一个通用的AI框架，通过几何对齐学习34种物理化学性质，无需重新训练即可应用于新材料发现任务，在数据中心浸没冷却液筛选中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI模型多为问题特定型，需要为每个新性质重新收集数据和训练，限制了材料发现的效率。

Method: 开发GATE框架，在共享几何空间中对齐34种热、电、机械和光学性质，捕捉跨性质相关性以减少分离性质偏差。

Result: 在数据中心浸没冷却液筛选中，从数十亿候选分子中识别出92,861个有前景分子，其中4个经实验验证性能达到或超过商业冷却液。

Conclusion: GATE是一个即用型、可泛化的AI平台，可广泛应用于各种材料发现任务。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful accelerator of
materials discovery, yet most existing models remain problem-specific,
requiring additional data collection and retraining for each new property. Here
we introduce and validate GATE (Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder) -- a
generalizable AI framework that jointly learns 34 physicochemical properties
spanning thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical domains. By aligning
these properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property
correlations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false
negatives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizability,
GATE -- without any problem-specific reconfiguration -- was directly applied to
the discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent
real-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). Screening
billions of candidates, GATE identified 92,861 molecules as promising for
practical deployment. Four were experimentally or literarily validated, showing
strong agreement with wet-lab measurements and performance comparable to or
exceeding a commercial coolant. These results establish GATE as a ready-to-use,
generalizable AI platform readily applicable across diverse materials discovery
tasks.

Method: 符号学习者从少量实例中检查可行数据的逻辑规范，每个规范约束提供给基于神经的生成器的条件信息，拒绝任何违反符号规范的实例。结合受限形式的归纳逻辑编程(ILP)与大型语言模型(LLM)。

Result: 在基准问题上，SNG性能与最先进方法统计相当；在探索性问题中，生成的分子表现出与领先临床候选药物相当的结合亲和力；专家认为符号规范作为初步过滤器很有用，多个生成分子被确定为可合成和湿实验室测试的可行候选物。

Conclusion: SNG利用符号和神经方法的互补优势，在药物设计等应用中表现出色，特别是在目标理解不足的探索性问题上，生成的分子具有临床潜力。

Abstract: We investigate a relatively underexplored class of hybrid neurosymbolic
models integrating symbolic learning with neural reasoning to construct data
generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural
Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of
feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each
specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a
neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic
specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the
complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG
is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible
instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that
satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics
for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and
\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,
and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In
this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We
implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug
design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor
molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are
well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood
targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading
clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as
preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for
synthesis and wet-lab testing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直接优化max@k指标的方法，通过推导无偏的on-policy梯度估计，并扩展到off-policy更新，解决了RLVR在数学和编程领域中多样性下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLVR在单次生成问题解决中表现出色，但其强化学习微调过程可能会损害模型的探索能力，导致生成多样性下降，进而在大规模Best-of-N采样时性能退化。

Method: 推导了max@k指标的无偏on-policy梯度估计，并将其扩展到off-policy更新，以提高样本效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在off-policy场景下有效优化了max@k指标，使模型与Best-of-N推理策略保持一致。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了RLVR在多样性探索方面的问题，为优化max@k指标提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to
mathematical and coding domains has demonstrated significant improvements in
the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models. Despite
its success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning
fine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in
decreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance
during Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on
optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive
an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric.
Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common
element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency.
Empirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in
off-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Eigen-Value (EV)框架，一种用于OOD鲁棒性的即插即用数据估值方法，仅使用ID数据子集，通过谱近似估计域差异，降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据估值方法主要基于ID设置，无法有效泛化到OOD场景，且OOD感知方法计算成本高，限制了实际部署。

Method: EV框架通过ID数据协方差矩阵的特征值比率来谱近似域差异，利用扰动理论估计每个数据点对域差异的边际贡献，无需额外训练循环。

Result: 在真实数据集上，EV实现了改进的OOD鲁棒性和稳定的价值排名，同时保持计算轻量级。

Conclusion: EV为存在域偏移的大规模设置提供了一种高效的OOD鲁棒数据估值路径，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives
efficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by
assigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation
methods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating
changes in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as
opposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different
patterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods
based on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when
the validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware
methods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),
a plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an
ID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral
approximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and
OOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then
estimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via
perturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV
plugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional
training loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and
stable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining
computationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for
large-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to
OOD-robust data valuation.

Conclusion: 要在广泛的问题上实现最优性能，必须结合通用描述符与任务特定的学习特征，并使用多样化的机器学习模型进行预测。

Abstract: We explore a "best-of-both" approach to modelling molecular properties by
combining learned molecular descriptors from a graph neural network (GNN) with
general-purpose descriptors and a mixed ensemble of machine learning (ML)
models. We introduce a MetaModel framework to aggregate predictions from a
diverse set of leading ML models. We present a featurisation scheme for
combining task-specific GNN-derived features with conventional molecular
descriptors.
  We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model
on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We
further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the
ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have
underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide
set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with
task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the
predictions.

TL;DR: 该论文研究在数据集被已知分布的随机噪声污染时，如何为(k,z)-聚类问题构建核心集，提出了一种新的替代误差度量方法，能获得比传统方法更小的核心集和更紧的近似保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当输入数据集被随机噪声污染时，评估核心集质量变得困难，因为真实底层数据集无法观测。需要找到可计算的替代误差度量来近似真实聚类成本。

Method: 分析传统度量并引入新的误差度量，设计基于该度量的核心集构建算法。新度量独立于噪声分布但能提供与噪声水平相关的近似保证。

Result: 在数据和噪声的温和假设下，新方法能获得比传统方法更小的核心集和更紧的近似保证，核心集大小最多可改善poly(k)倍。真实数据集实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 提出的新误差度量方法在噪声污染的数据集上能构建更高效的核心集，在理论和实践中都优于传统方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing coresets for $(k, z)$-clustering when
the input dataset is corrupted by stochastic noise drawn from a known
distribution. In this setting, evaluating the quality of a coreset is
inherently challenging, as the true underlying dataset is unobserved. To
address this, we investigate coreset construction using surrogate error metrics
that are tractable and provably related to the true clustering cost. We analyze
a traditional metric from prior work and introduce a new error metric that more
closely aligns with the true cost. Although our metric is defined independently
of the noise distribution, it enables approximation guarantees that scale with
the noise level. We design a coreset construction algorithm based on this
metric and show that, under mild assumptions on the data and noise, enforcing
an $\varepsilon$-bound under our metric yields smaller coresets and tighter
guarantees on the true clustering cost than those obtained via classical
metrics. In particular, we prove that the coreset size can improve by a factor
of up to $\mathrm{poly}(k)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Experiments on
real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
practical advantages of our approach.

Abstract: In this work, we study out-of-distribution generalization in meta-learning
from an information-theoretic perspective. We focus on two scenarios: (i) when
the testing environment mismatches the training environment, and (ii) when the
training environment is broader than the testing environment. The first
corresponds to the standard distribution mismatch setting, while the second
reflects a broad-to-narrow training scenario. We further formalize the
generalization problem in meta-reinforcement learning and establish
corresponding generalization bounds. Finally, we analyze the generalization
performance of a gradient-based meta-reinforcement learning algorithm.

Abstract: We introduce the Schrodinger Neural Network (SNN), a principled architecture
for conditional density estimation and uncertainty quantification inspired by
quantum mechanics. The SNN maps each input to a normalized wave function on the
output domain and computes predictive probabilities via the Born rule. The SNN
departs from standard parametric likelihood heads by learning complex
coefficients of a spectral expansion (e . g ., Chebyshev polynomials) whose
squared modulus yields the conditional density $p(y|x)=\left| \psi _x(y)\right|
{}^2$ with analytic normalization. This representation confers three practical
advantages: positivity and exact normalization by construction, native
multimodality through interference among basis modes without explicit mixture
bookkeeping, and yields closed-form (or efficiently computable)
functionals$-$such as moments and several calibration diagnostics$-$as
quadratic forms in coefficient space. We develop the statistical and
computational foundations of the SNN, including (i) training by exact
maximum-likelihood with unit-sphere coefficient parameterization, (ii)
physics-inspired quadratic regularizers (kinetic and potential energies)
motivated by uncertainty relations between localization and spectral
complexity, (iii) scalable low-rank and separable extensions for multivariate
outputs, (iv) operator-based extensions that represent observables,
constraints, and weak labels as self-adjoint matrices acting on the amplitude
space, and (v) a comprehensive framework for evaluating multimodal predictions.
The SNN provides a coherent, tractable framework to elevate probabilistic
prediction from point estimates to physically inspired amplitude-based
distributions.

Result: 在6个国家的心率预测数据集上，SGFusion显著提高了模型效用，收敛时具有上界期望误差，且在所有国家都优于现有方法，同时不显著影响系统可扩展性。

Conclusion: SGFusion通过地理信息的概率性梯度融合，显著提升了联邦学习模型的效用，同时保持了计算效率，是一种有效的跨区域知识共享方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes Stochastic Geographic Gradient Fusion (SGFusion), a novel
training algorithm to leverage the geographic information of mobile users in
Federated Learning (FL). SGFusion maps the data collected by mobile devices
onto geographical zones and trains one FL model per zone, which adapts well to
the data and behaviors of users in that zone. SGFusion models the local
data-based correlation among geographical zones as a hierarchical random graph
(HRG) optimized by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. At each training step,
every zone fuses its local gradient with gradients derived from a small set of
other zones sampled from the HRG. This approach enables knowledge fusion and
sharing among geographical zones in a probabilistic and stochastic gradient
fusion process with self-attention weights, such that "more similar" zones have
"higher probabilities" of sharing gradients with "larger attention weights."
SGFusion remarkably improves model utility without introducing undue
computational cost. Extensive theoretical and empirical results using a
heart-rate prediction dataset collected across 6 countries show that models
trained with SGFusion converge with upper-bounded expected errors and
significantly improve utility in all countries compared to existing approaches
without notable cost in system scalability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves
privacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its
prototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled
by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \emph{over-the-air
FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \emph{frenemy}
in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while
providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,
formally quantified by \emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,
nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as
prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted
types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a
single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study
AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station
(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which
claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to
ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as
a \emph{perk} even \emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a
novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on
model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and
non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power
allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which
also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising
training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive
numerical results.

Motivation: 现有的图提示方法主要关注提升下游任务的模型效用，但忽视了公平性问题。预训练的GNN模型会产生跨人口统计子群的歧视性节点表示，因为下游图数据在节点属性和图结构中存在固有偏见。

Result: 在四个数据集和四种预训练策略上的实验表明，ADPrompt在节点分类任务上优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: ADPrompt能够有效缓解预训练GNN在下游任务中的公平性问题，通过双重提示机制在保持模型性能的同时增强公平性。

Abstract: In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through
self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely
adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for
pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between
pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts
pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable
prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph
prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,
they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In
fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations
across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains
biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we
propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness
for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute
bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized
attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer,
reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message
Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust
the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of
the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting
modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct
extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to
evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed
ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 芯片布局对芯片设计质量有重大影响，虽然BBO在芯片布局中已有几十年历史，但缺乏统一的BBO专用基准来全面评估不同问题表述和算法。

Method: 开发了BBOPlace-Bench基准，包含三种BBO芯片布局问题表述（掩模引导优化、超参数优化、序列对），采用模块化、解耦和灵活框架，整合了模拟退火、进化算法、贝叶斯优化等多种BBO算法。

Abstract: Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial
impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip.
The use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of
several decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem
formulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the
effectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential
to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field
lacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various
problem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose
BBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and
developing BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem
formulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and
flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and
compare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of
existing BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary
algorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show
that the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter
optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem
formulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO,
especially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art
performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench
not only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip
placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are
urgently needed) for the BBO community. The code of BBOPlace-Bench is available

*Julie Mordacq,David Loiseaux,Vicky Kalogeiton,Steve Oudot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T-REGS是一个基于最小生成树长度的自监督学习正则化框架，能同时缓解维度坍塌并促进分布均匀性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习需要避免维度坍塌（特征仅占据低维子空间）和增强分布均匀性，现有方法难以同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 提出T-REGS框架，使用最小生成树长度作为正则化项，在任意紧致黎曼流形上同时缓解维度坍塌和促进分布均匀性。

Result: 在合成数据和经典自监督学习基准测试上的实验验证了该方法的有效性，能够提升表示质量。

Conclusion: T-REGS是一个简单有效的正则化框架，能够同时解决自监督学习中的维度坍塌和分布不均匀问题。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to
input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have
highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding
dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional
subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this
work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on
the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation.
We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously
mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on
arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data
and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at
enhancing representation quality.

TL;DR: 通过惩罚推理token的强化学习方法来缩短思维链长度，同时保持准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通常消耗过多token，增加了计算成本和延迟，挑战了更长响应能提高准确性的假设

Method: 使用带折扣的强化学习设置惩罚推理token（可解释为小的token成本），并在受限策略类中分析Blackwell最优性

Result: 实验证实该方法能缩短思维链同时保持准确性

Conclusion: 该方法能够鼓励简洁而准确的推理，减少计算开销而不牺牲性能

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often consume excessive tokens, inflating
computational cost and latency. We challenge the assumption that longer
responses improve accuracy. By penalizing reasoning tokens using a discounted
reinforcement learning setup (interpretable as a small token cost) and
analyzing Blackwell optimality in restricted policy classes, we encourage
concise yet accurate reasoning. Experiments confirm our theoretical results
that this approach shortens chains of thought while preserving accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于神经ODE的混合精度训练框架，通过自定义的反向传播方案和显式ODE求解器，在保持精度的同时实现约50%内存减少和最高2倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经ODE训练中的两个关键挑战：重复网络评估的计算成本和随着时间步数增加的内存需求增长。现有混合精度方案在连续时间架构中不可靠。

Method: 使用低精度计算评估神经网络参数化的速度函数和存储中间状态，通过自定义动态伴随缩放和在高精度中累积解和梯度来保证稳定性。

Result: 在图像分类和生成模型等应用中，实现了约50%内存减少和最高2倍加速，同时保持与单精度训练相当的精度。

Conclusion: 该混合精度训练框架为神经ODE提供了可靠且高效的训练方案，并发布了开源的PyTorch包rampde作为现有代码的即插即用替代方案。

Abstract: Exploiting low-precision computations has become a standard strategy in deep
learning to address the growing computational costs imposed by ever larger
models and datasets. However, naively performing all computations in low
precision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed
precision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use
low-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their
success, these principles are currently not reliable for training
continuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations
(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for
neural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation
scheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.
Our scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,
parameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while
stability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating
the solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two
key challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated
network evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of
time steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable,
open-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading
packages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the
reliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on
neural ODE applications in image classification and generative models,
achieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while
maintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了RGA KANs来解决深度cPIKANs的训练不稳定问题，通过Glorot-like初始化方案和残差门控架构，在多个PDE基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度Chebyshev物理信息KANs（cPIKANs）在训练时面临不稳定问题，限制了其在多个PDE问题中的应用。

Method: 提出了基础无关的Glorot-like初始化方案来保持激活方差，并设计了残差门控自适应KANs（RGA KANs）架构来缓解深度cPIKANs的发散问题。

Result: 在7个标准前向PDE基准测试中，RGA KANs始终优于参数匹配的cPIKANs和PirateNets，通常高出几个数量级，并在其他方法发散时保持稳定。

Conclusion: RGA KANs通过改进的初始化和架构设计，成功解决了深度物理信息KANs的训练稳定性问题，在PDE求解中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been
successfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the
PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the
standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer
perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled
to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to
several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like
initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial
improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of
cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce
Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in
deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical
tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully
traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the
diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward
PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components
demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and
PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in
settings where the others diverge.

*Siamak Ghodsi,Amjad Seyedi,Tai Le Quy,Fariba Karimi,Eirini Ntoutsi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DFNMF方法，一种端到端的深度非负三因子分解模型，用于公平图聚类，通过单一参数λ平衡公平性与效用性，实现可扩展的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平图聚类方法采用刚性约束或多阶段流程，限制了权衡控制、可解释性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用深度非负三因子分解直接优化聚类分配，结合软统计奇偶正则化器，采用稀疏友好的交替更新算法。

Result: 在合成和真实网络中，DFNMF在保持相当模块性的同时实现了显著更高的群体平衡，在帕累托前沿上通常优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: DFNMF提供了一种有效且可扩展的公平图聚类解决方案，通过单一参数实现公平性与效用的灵活平衡。

Abstract: Fair graph clustering seeks partitions that respect network structure while
maintaining proportional representation across sensitive groups, with
applications spanning community detection, team formation, resource allocation,
and social network analysis. Many existing approaches enforce rigid constraints
or rely on multi-stage pipelines (e.g., spectral embedding followed by
$k$-means), limiting trade-off control, interpretability, and scalability. We
introduce \emph{DFNMF}, an end-to-end deep nonnegative tri-factorization
tailored to graphs that directly optimizes cluster assignments with a soft
statistical-parity regularizer. A single parameter $\lambda$ tunes the
fairness--utility balance, while nonnegativity yields parts-based factors and
transparent soft memberships. The optimization uses sparse-friendly alternating
updates and scales near-linearly with the number of edges. Across synthetic and
real networks, DFNMF achieves substantially higher group balance at comparable
modularity, often dominating state-of-the-art baselines on the Pareto front.

TL;DR: 提出了Seq-MADAC框架，通过考虑多参数间的内在依赖关系来解决动态算法配置问题，使用顺序优势分解网络利用动作顺序信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂算法中多个参数存在内在依赖关系（如先确定算子类型再确定算子参数），但现有方法未考虑这些依赖关系，导致次优结果。

Method: 提出顺序多智能体动态算法配置框架，采用顺序优势分解网络来利用动作顺序信息。

Result: 从合成函数到多目标优化算法配置的实验表明，Seq-MADAC优于最先进的多智能体强化学习方法，并在问题类别间表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Seq-MADAC为依赖感知的自动化算法配置建立了新范式。

Abstract: Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine
learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the
execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks.
Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved
the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various
parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex
algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g.,
determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which
are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to
sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC
(Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent
inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a
sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order
information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from
synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization
algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art
MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC
establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated
algorithm configuration. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个完全可定制和自适应的系统，用于直接从图像中翻译文本，而不依赖大型预训练模型。

Method: 使用U-Net模型检测图像中的文本区域，Tesseract引擎提取文本，然后通过从头训练的多语言Transformer模型进行翻译。

Result: 系统在文本检测准确性、文本识别质量和翻译性能（BLEU分数）方面都显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: 验证了定制构建系统直接从图像翻译文本的可行性。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that
integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text
recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for
Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model,
trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions
from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to
extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer
model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5
languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our
architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is
evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and
translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates
promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for
translating text directly from images.

*Zhongyi Yu,Jianqiu Wu,Zhenghao Wu,Shuhan Zhong,Weifeng Su,Chul-Ho Lee,Weipeng Zhuo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TAMI框架来解决时序图链接预测中的异质性问题，包含对数时间编码函数(LTE)和链接历史聚合(LHA)两个组件，能有效提升现有时序图神经网络模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序交互中天然存在异质性，如少数节点对产生大部分交互事件、交互间隔时间不均等，导致现有方法在预测不频繁交互节点对的链接时效果不佳。

Method: TAMI框架包含两个核心组件：LTE通过对交互间隔进行对数变换实现更平衡的时间编码；LHA防止间歇性交互节点对的历史交互信息被遗忘。该框架可与现有SOTA时序图神经网络无缝集成。

Result: 在13个经典数据集和3个最新TGB数据集上的实验表明，TAMI在转导和归纳设置下都能持续提升底层模型的链接预测性能。

Conclusion: TAMI通过有效处理时序交互的异质性，显著提升了时序图链接预测的性能，特别是对于不频繁交互的节点对。

Abstract: Temporal graph link prediction aims to predict future interactions between
nodes in a graph based on their historical interactions, which are encoded in
node embeddings. We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal
interactions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and
interaction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of
ineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions
for a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.
Existing methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning
process, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,
especially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.
To cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which
contains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and
link history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information
through transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA
prevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being
forgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly
and readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment
results on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB)
datasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance
of the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Alleinx/TAMI_temporal_graph.

*Cheol Woo Kim,Shresth Verma,Mauricio Tec,Milind Tambe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DPO-PRO方法，通过轻量级分布鲁棒优化解决DPO对噪声敏感和过拟合的问题，在保持计算效率的同时提升对噪声偏好信号的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO方法虽然流行但容易受到数据噪声影响且易过拟合，现有DRO方法又过于保守且计算成本高，需要一种更轻量级的鲁棒优化方案。

Method: 基于DPO框架，引入偏好分布不确定性的轻量级DRO公式，专注于偏好不确定性，避免不必要的保守性，计算开销可忽略。

Result: 在标准对齐基准和真实公共卫生任务上的实验表明，相比现有DPO变体，DPO-PRO能持续提升对噪声偏好信号的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调算法，通过正则化DPO目标惩罚模型在弱偏好信号下的过度自信，实现了更好的鲁棒性而不增加显著计算成本。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity.
However, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to
overfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the
data. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high
computational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a
robust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior
DRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences,
avoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational
overhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO
objective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We
evaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public
health task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves
robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准掩码扩散模型在离散生成建模中无法有效捕捉并发预测token间的依赖关系，导致在依赖关系重要的场景下生成质量下降。

Method: 在掩码扩散过程中引入潜变量，通过变分推断方法显式建模token间的依赖关系。

Result: 在合成数据集、数独谜题和文本数据集上的实验表明，VMD成功学习了传统掩码扩散无法捕捉的依赖关系，提高了生成质量和全局一致性。

Conclusion: 将变分推断整合到掩码扩散中能够有效增强生成质量和依赖感知能力，证明了该方法的实用价值。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for
discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked
diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens
that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when
dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among
tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that
introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through
controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD
successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to
capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku
puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves
global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality
and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational
inference into masked diffusion. Our code is available at:

Abstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology
presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human
psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a
comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between
isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological
analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development
lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four
diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques.
Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that
necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical
engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in
regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting
large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative
large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques
to function as an interactive "Personality Brain." Finally, the entire suite of
predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust,
scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful
stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing,
showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and
the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI
research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach,
demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates
predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical
model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: PREFINE框架通过构建伪用户代理和用户特定评估标准，实现无需参数更新或直接用户反馈的个性化故事生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统个性化方法依赖显式反馈或微调，存在用户负担、数据收集、计算成本和隐私等实际问题。

Method: 基于用户交互历史构建伪用户代理，生成用户特定评估标准，让该代理代表用户进行批判和精炼。

Result: 在PerDOC和PerMPST数据集上，PREFINE在自动评估中获得了更高的胜率和统计显著分数，且不损害一般故事质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持故事质量的同时有效提升个性化程度，可扩展到对话系统、教育和推荐等更广泛应用。

Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the
quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing
personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional
approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical
issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and
privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided
Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine
paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a
user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation
criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's
behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized
generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets.
We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the
contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations
(LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically
significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story
quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user
agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization
performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling
efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems,
education, and recommendation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实AI系统处理复杂问题时，多个大语言模型智能体间的交互可能导致约定不一致，从而破坏协调。协作编码和分布式规划等应用需要可靠、一致的通信，且系统扩展性是关键问题。

Method: 引入SIGN命名游戏，研究轻量级结构如何引导约定形成，比较模式诱导通信与无约束自然语言的效果。

Result: 模式诱导通信相比无约束自然语言能实现更快收敛，协议一致性提高达5.8倍。

Conclusion: 最小化结构可作为多智能体协调的简单控制机制，实现高效协调，在命名游戏之外有更广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often
through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents
develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications
such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require
reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as
systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming
game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We
compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find
faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that
minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent
coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

TL;DR: 研究发现解码器自回归语言模型在知识密集型任务中存在能力上限，参数规模扩大时准确率提升有限，而损失函数持续下降，显示传统缩放定律失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索解码器自回归语言模型在知识密集型任务中的能力缩放特性，了解参数规模扩大是否带来相应性能提升。

Method: 系统评估OPT和Pythia模型家族（70M-30B参数），分析损失函数与准确率的关系，并进行注意力干预实验。

Result: 知识检索任务准确率提升微乎其微，数学基准准确率维持在19-20%，而损失函数下降31%。注意力模式交换导致性能灾难性崩溃。

Conclusion: 对于OPT和Pythia架构，参数规模超过1-2B在知识密集型应用中准确率增益有限，这些发现为资源分配决策提供量化依据。

Abstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive
language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT
and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling)
reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement
despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains
flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy
loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show
conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention
intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping
attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse
(complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements
have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications
using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers
minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings
quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform
resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental
constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific
limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse
architectural approaches.

Conclusion: 通过链式思维训练可以显著提升几何推理能力，错误主要源于数学概念误解或空间判断错误，通过CoT纠正这些错误可获得正确答案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual
reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance
substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges.
Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic
complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step
reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack
sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently
hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed
the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two
subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version
Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual
descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection
steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a
mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking
processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in
geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset
improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that
errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts
or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model
produces correct answers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成模型解决组合优化问题的潜力，利用学习策略的优势实现计算可扩展性，在经典精确方法不可行的大规模问题中具有潜力。

Method: 使用轨迹平衡损失训练GFlowNets，顺序构建解决方案：为生成树选择边、为路径选择节点、为旅行选择城市。

Result: 在多种规模的基准实例上，GFlowNets学会找到最优解，生成解与经典算法结果匹配，训练收敛性取决于问题复杂度。

Conclusion: 生成模型可以通过学习策略解决组合优化问题，主要优势是计算可扩展性，通过训练分摊计算成本，有潜力扩展到经典精确方法不可行的大规模问题。

Abstract: This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph
optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning
Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample
solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the
Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, selecting edges for
spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark
instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions.
For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of
nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical
algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact
solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the
number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size
grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from
classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that
generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned
policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational
scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance,
GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational
resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances
where classical exact methods become infeasible.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在部分$q^{\pi}$-可实现性框架下强化学习的计算复杂性，证明了在该设置下学习$\epsilon$-最优策略是计算困难的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在函数逼近自然出现的实用模型中，当值函数对于策略集$\Pi$中的策略是线性可实现时，学习最优策略的计算复杂性。

Method: 通过从$\delta$-Max-3SAT和$\delta$-Max-3SAT(b)问题归约到GLinear-$\kappa$-RL（贪婪策略）和SLinear-$\kappa$-RL（softmax策略）实例，建立计算复杂性下界。

Result: 证明了在参数化贪婪策略集下学习是NP困难的，在softmax策略集下存在指数级下界（除非NP = RP）。

Conclusion: 在部分$q^{\pi}$-可实现性框架下，正面的计算结果通常无法实现，这与生成访问模型下的$q^{\pi}$-可实现性形成对比。

Abstract: This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement
learning in a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set $\Pi$, under
the assumption that all value functions for policies in $\Pi$ are linearly
realizable. The assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in
$q^{\pi}$-realizability but stronger than those in $q^*$-realizability,
providing a practical model where function approximation naturally arises. We
prove that learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in this setting is
computationally hard. Specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a
parameterized greedy policy set (argmax) and show that - unless NP = RP - an
exponential lower bound (in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set
contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Our hardness results mirror those in $q^*$-realizability and suggest
computational difficulty persists even when $\Pi$ is expanded beyond the
optimal policy. To establish this, we reduce from two complexity problems,
$\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\delta$-Max-3SAT(b), to instances of GLinear-$\kappa$-RL
(greedy policy) and SLinear-$\kappa$-RL (softmax policy). Our findings indicate
that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability, in contrast to $q^{\pi}$-realizability under a
generative access model.

*Josip Tomo Licardo,Nikola Tankovic*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究表明，经过优化的10亿参数小型开源模型在电子商务意图识别任务中可以达到与GPT-4.1相当的99%准确率，同时大幅降低计算成本和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商用大型语言模型在专业领域部署时面临高计算成本、延迟和运营费用的问题，需要寻找资源效率更高的替代方案。

Method: 使用量化低秩适应(QLoRA)对10亿参数的Llama 3.2模型进行微调，并在合成数据集上进行训练，然后应用后训练量化技术创建GPU优化(GPTQ)和CPU优化(GGUF)版本。

Result: 专业化的1B模型达到99%准确率，匹配GPT-4.1性能。4位GPTQ减少41%显存使用但推理速度下降82%，而GGUF格式在CPU上实现18倍推理吞吐量提升和90%以上内存消耗减少。

Conclusion: 经过适当优化的小型开源模型不仅是可行的，而且是领域特定应用中更合适的替代方案，能以极低计算成本提供最先进的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural
language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading
commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered
by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper
investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a
resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a
one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent
recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user
queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,
creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results
demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the
performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance
analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ
reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older
GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF
formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a
reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We
conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a
viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications,
offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

### [434] [Distribution Shift Alignment Helps LLMs Simulate Survey Response Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21977)
*Ji Huang,Mengfei Li,Shuai Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为分布偏移对齐(DSA)的两阶段微调方法，用于改进LLM模拟人类调查响应的能力，显著减少真实数据需求并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本方法存在提示敏感性和低准确性问题，而传统微调方法主要拟合训练集分布，无法产生比训练集更准确的结果，这偏离了使用LLM模拟调查响应的初衷。

Method: DSA是一种两阶段微调方法，通过对齐输出分布和不同背景下的分布偏移，学习这些分布如何变化而非仅仅拟合训练数据。

Result: 在五个公开调查数据集上，DSA始终优于其他方法，能够提供比训练数据更接近真实分布的结果，减少真实数据需求达53.48-69.12%。

Conclusion: DSA在调查模拟中展现出有效性和效率，通过分布偏移对齐显著提升了LLM模拟人类调查响应的能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey
responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection.
However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low
accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set
distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training
set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate
survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift
Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output
distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By
learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA
can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the
training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five
public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering
accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by
53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey
simulation.

Abstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial
intelligence (AI) dating back to 1960s. This research aims to advance the
reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence.
The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based
methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large
language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the
MWP survey along with a discussion of current development trends. Therefore, in
this paper, we aim to comprehensively review related research in MWP solving
through the lens of human cognition, to demonstrate how recent AI models are
advancing in simulating human cognitive abilities. Specifically, we summarize 5
crucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding,
Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge
Learning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in
recent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the
core human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving
process. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement
their performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison. To the
best of our knowledge, this survey first comprehensively analyzes the
influential MWP research of the past decade from the perspective of human
reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across
existing approaches. We hope it can inspire further research in AI reasoning.

TL;DR: LightAgent是一个移动GUI代理解决方案，通过设备-云协作结合本地小模型和云端大模型的优势，在保持高性能的同时显著降低云成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动GUI代理面临关键困境：真正在设备上运行的模型（4B或更小）性能不足，而能力强的模型（从7B开始）要么太大无法在移动设备部署，要么成本过高（如仅限云端的闭源MLLM）。

Method: 通过两阶段SFT->GRPO训练增强Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型，集成高效长推理机制利用历史交互，默认在设备上执行，仅通过实时复杂度评估将具有挑战性的子任务升级到云端。

Result: 在AndroidLab基准测试和多样化应用上的实验表明，LightAgent匹配或接近更大模型的性能，同时显著降低了云成本。

Conclusion: LightAgent通过设备-云协作成功解决了移动GUI代理的部署困境，在保持高性能的同时实现了成本效益。

Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building
GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for
mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch
interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device
models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models
(starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively
costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose
LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages
device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and
the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks.
Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO
training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an
efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under
tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating
challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment.
Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent
matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

Motivation: 解决LLM在关键决策应用中准确性不稳定的问题，特别是在风险投资领域预测初创企业成功，需要可靠且可解释的预测模型。

Method: 提出LLM-AR管道，受神经符号系统启发，将LLM生成的启发式规则蒸馏为ProbLog自动推理引擎执行的概率规则，并通过迭代策略进化循环结合关联规则挖掘逐步优化预测规则。

Conclusion: 该框架具有可解释性和超参数可调性，显示出扩展到其他领域的潜力，为高风险决策提供了可靠的AI支持工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can already identify patterns and reason
effectively, yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in high-stakes
decision-making applications. In this paper, we study this issue from a venture
capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder
traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a
pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated
heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning
engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule
mining to progressively refine the prediction rules.
  On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the
random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human
inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters,
showing promise to extend into other domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在部分可观测环境中，结合预测编码模块的元强化学习能够学习到更紧凑、可解释的贝叶斯最优信念状态表示，相比传统元强化学习具有更好的表示学习能力和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统元强化学习虽然能学习到接近贝叶斯最优的策略，但往往无法学习到紧凑、可解释的贝叶斯最优信念状态表示，这种表示效率低可能限制智能体的适应性和泛化能力。

Method: 将自监督预测编码模块集成到元强化学习中，受到神经科学中预测编码理论和深度强化学习中辅助预测目标的启发。

Result: 在状态机模拟中，带预测模块的元强化学习在各种任务中都能生成更可解释的表示，更好地逼近贝叶斯最优信念状态，即使在两者都达到最优策略的情况下也是如此。在需要主动信息搜索的挑战性任务中，只有带预测模块的元强化学习能成功学习最优表示和策略。

Conclusion: 预测学习可以作为在部分可观测环境中导航的智能体进行有效表示学习的指导原则，更好的表示学习能带来改进的泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and
generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement
learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to
learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This
representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and
generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which
suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of
Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we
investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into
meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state
machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently
generates more interpretable representations that better approximate
Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide
variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks
requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules
successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional
meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we
demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved
generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as
a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating
partial observability.

Abstract: We present a case study applying the SpecC methodology within a system-level
hardware/software co-design flow to a PCM-to-PWM converter, the core of a
Class-D audio amplifier. The converter was modeled and explored with SpecC
methodology to derive an HW/SW partition. Using system-level estimates and fast
functional simulation, we evaluated mappings that meet real-time constraints
while reducing estimated cost of an all-hardware solution and avoiding the
expense of a purely software implementation on a high-end processor. Despite
the design's moderate complexity, the results underline the value of
system-level co-design for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and
actionable cost/performance trade-offs. [Original work from 2005; formatting

Motivation: 当前机器学习系统虽然预测性能优异，但因果透明度低，缺乏可干预的机制。需要重新定义智能为构建和修正解释的能力。

Result: ESCMs在温和条件下可恢复标准SCM语义，提供了因果推理的形式化语言。

Conclusion: 论文为追求理解而不仅仅是预测的系统提供了因果推理的形式化框架，使内部结构在解释层面可操作。

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy, yet systems
that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque: their
internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention. We can
retrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while
holding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics.
We argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build
and refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that
specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention.
Explanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be
independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce
computational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready
causal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured
Causal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy
functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and
interventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes
internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which
relations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We
provide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM
in the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization
systematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we
analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under
mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's
principles (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as
explanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for
causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict.

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a tight hold on broad
aspects of society, industry, business, and governance in ways that dictate the
prosperity and might of the world's economies. The AI market size is projected
to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI
is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual
intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data
scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train
GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic
that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In
contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the
next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal
models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions
in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning
continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making
capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's
large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient
domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of
uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to
allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a
vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

Conclusion: 需要建立安全、可信和有效的脑-智能体协作系统，重点关注伦理数据管理、模型可靠性和稳健的人-智能体协作框架。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between
the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for
individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread
adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer
rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges,
recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex
cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces
technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive
discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the
field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration
(BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for
intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors,
demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust
human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe,
trustworthy, and effective.

trait inventories (Big Five, \hexaco) or ad hoc personas, limiting behavioral
realism and domain relevance. We propose a framework that (1) uses situational
judgment tests (SJTs) from realistic scenarios to probe domain-specific
competencies; (2) integrates industrial-organizational and personality
psychology to design sophisticated personas which include behavioral and
psychological descriptors, life history, and social and emotional functions;
and (3) employs structured generation with population demographic priors and
memoir inspired narratives, encoded with Pydantic schemas. In a law enforcement
assistant case study, we construct a rich dataset of personas drawn across 8
persona archetypes and SJTs across 11 attributes, and analyze behaviors across
subpopulation and scenario slices. The dataset spans 8,500 personas, 4,000
SJTs, and 300,000 responses. We will release the dataset and all code to the
public.

### [445] [Dopamine-driven synaptic credit assignment in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22178)
*Saranraj Nambusubramaniyan,Shervin Safavi,Raja Guru,Andreas Knoblauch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Dopamine优化器，一种基于权重扰动的无导数优化方法，通过最小化期望结果与实际结果之间的遗憾（奖励预测误差）来训练神经网络，解决了反向传播的计算效率和生物合理性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决反向传播在计算效率、内存消耗以及生物合理性方面的局限性，包括权重传输和更新锁定问题，从神经强化学习中汲取灵感开发更高效的优化方法。

Method: 基于权重扰动学习，利用权重的随机更新向最优解移动，通过最小化期望结果与实际结果之间的奖励预测误差来调整网络的学习率，实现自适应学习率策略。

Result: 在XOR任务和混沌时间序列预测任务中，Dopamine优化器训练的模型收敛速度更快，性能优于标准权重扰动方法，与基于梯度的算法性能相当，同时计算和内存消耗显著减少。

Conclusion: Dopamine优化器不仅找到了鲁棒解，性能与最先进的机器学习优化器相当，而且在神经生物学上更具合理性。

Abstract: Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in
both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for
synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each
neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or
animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural
networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For
instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations.
This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and
memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To
address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration
from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for
training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight
Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards
optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction
Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the
actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the
learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate
strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine
optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent
neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models
demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give
comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming
significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not
only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.

Result: 在具有挑战性的基准测试中，OptiTree相比最先进方法显著提升建模准确性，改进超过10%

Conclusion: 树搜索的自适应问题分解方法能有效处理复杂运筹学问题的建模，为自动化建模提供了新思路

Abstract: Optimization modeling is one of the most crucial but technical parts of
operations research (OR). To automate the modeling process, existing works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into
steps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to
the highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard
fixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to
enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem
decomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling
tree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical
problem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category
and containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model,
we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and
synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the
hierarchical thoughts. Experiments show that OptiTree significantly improves
the modeling accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving over 10\%
improvements on the challenging benchmarks. The code is released at
https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/OptiTree/tree/main.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PACR方法，通过基于模型对正确答案置信度的渐进上升趋势来提供密集奖励，加速强化学习中的探索过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR的稀疏、基于结果的奖励无法为中间推理步骤提供指导，导致探索缓慢。需要一种密集的模型内在奖励来引导推理过程。

Method: PACR方法直接计算模型对正确答案置信度的演化，编码了推理轨迹中正确答案概率应呈现渐进上升趋势的归纳偏置。

Result: PACR加速了探索过程，用更少的轨迹达到奖励饱和，并在多个基准测试中取得了改进。

Conclusion: 密集的模型内在塑造信号可以使RLVR训练更加有效和可靠。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly
improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no
guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively
Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed
directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes
the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the
probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.
We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive
bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically
sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches
reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple
benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can
make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

largely unexplored due to the lack of a dedicated dataset. Therefore, we
curated the first large-scale Vietnamese ALT dataset (VietLyrics), comprising
647 hours of songs with line-level aligned lyrics and metadata to address these

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a
fundamental NP-hard optimization problem in logistics. Solving large-scale
instances remains computationally challenging for exact solvers. This work
introduces a multilevel graph coarsening and refinement framework that
aggregates customers into meta-nodes using a spatio-temporal distance metric.
The reduced problem is solved with classical heuristics and subsequently
expanded back into the original space with feasibility corrections. Preliminary
experiments on Solomon benchmark instances show that the proposed method
reduces computation time while preserving or improving solution quality,
particularly with respect to capacity and time window constraints. The paper
also explores the integration of quantum-inspired optimization techniques,
highlighting their potential to further accelerate large-scale vehicle routing
tasks.

Abstract: This study proposes an interpretable prediction framework with
literature-informed fine-tuned (LIFT) LLMs for truck driving risk prediction.
The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and
explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and
summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a
Result Evaluator that evaluates the prediction performance as well as the
interpretability of the LIFT LLM. After fine-tuning on a real-world truck
driving risk dataset, the LIFT LLM achieved accurate risk prediction,
outperforming benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score.
Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed
from 299 domain papers, the LIFT LLM produced variable importance ranking
consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating
robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The
LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination
of variables in truck driving risk, which were verified by PERMANOVA tests.
Finally, we demonstrated the contribution of the literature knowledge base and
the fine-tuning process in the interpretability of the LIFT LLM, and discussed
the potential of the LIFT LLM in data-driven knowledge discovery.

Motivation: 现有几何推理基准主要关注2D平面几何，依赖静态数据集容易导致数据污染和记忆，且仅评估最终答案而忽略推理过程。

Method: 通过半自动标注流程构建，包含503个专家标注的种子问题，可动态生成多样化多模态实例，并基于专家标注的推理链进行过程评估。

Result: 实验显示主流视觉语言模型在动态设置下性能严重下降，在需要高级空间智能的任务上表现较差。

Conclusion: DynaSolidGeo填补了立体几何推理评估的空白，揭示了当前模型在空间推理方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that
integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing
multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane
geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization,
and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process.
To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic
benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo
contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically
generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances.
Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on
expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal
coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs
reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor
performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental
rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在近期具有实用性，但需要开发能够超越训练分布复杂度的新方法来实现真正的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning
tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail
catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit
these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs
fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and
self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as
NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of
generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as
mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the
complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have
limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset
(DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of
scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph
connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance
of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also
relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large,
real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find
the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet
the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights
the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that
generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the
resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn
hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However,
understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open
problem, with many potential important applications including improving
training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless
Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical
reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a
small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction,
augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and
final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's
reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states,
we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the
state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze,
interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the
FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss
how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach
to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals
distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to
evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bring deployed in agentic
settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is
increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate
effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI
alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical
insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and
an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator
that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant
propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions
by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and
related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning
interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this
setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal
behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative
Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal
collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show
that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence
and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

Conclusion: 当前多模态遗忘方法存在显著脆弱性，需要开发更鲁棒的解决方案来应对现实世界应用的复杂性。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about
data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned
information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs
are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and
insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of
real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and
alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel
benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football
transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80
players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess
forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports
advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and
crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive
evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods
(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning
efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle
with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can
be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These
results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting
the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions. The code is available

TL;DR: ATOM是一种少样本、可扩展的方法，能从非结构化文本中构建和持续更新时序知识图谱，通过将文档分解为原子事实并采用双时间建模，显著提高了提取的完整性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识图谱构建忽略了现实世界数据的动态性和时效性，而现有的零/少样本方法在多次运行中存在不稳定性和关键事实覆盖不完整的问题。

Method: 将输入文档分割为最小自包含的原子事实，构建原子时序知识图谱，采用双时间建模区分信息被观察的时间和有效时间，然后并行合并这些原子图谱。

Result: 相比基线方法，ATOM实现了约18%的完整性提升、约17%的稳定性改善以及超过90%的延迟减少，展示了动态时序知识图谱构建的强大可扩展性。

Conclusion: ATOM通过原子事实提取和双时间建模，有效解决了传统知识图谱构建的动态适应性问题，在完整性、稳定性和效率方面均表现出显著优势。

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from
unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and
dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)
construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of
real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent
zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance
on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as
well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we
introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that
builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from
unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained
"atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it
constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling
that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The
resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%
better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,
demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

Result: 当预训练数据分布与查询任务分布不同时，适当构建的上下文可以量化地将输出分布向查询任务分布偏移，从而提高查询主题的预测准确性。

Conclusion: 研究为理解上下文学习机制提供了理论框架，明确了预训练数据分布与任务分布差异对ICL性能的影响，并建立了性能与上下文长度及分布差异的量化关系。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn
from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent
applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least
theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the
precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as
context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the
ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network
architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process.
As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer,
and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is
different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can
shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a
quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then
extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the
precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL
divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide
experiments to validate our theoretical results.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的医疗系统缺乏医学基础且无法量化不确定性，导致输出不安全。需要开发能够确保临床安全性的决策支持框架。

Method: 使用BioBERT在1,200个临床案例上微调，结合Focal Loss和Monte Carlo Dropout实现置信度感知预测；采用Biomedical Sentence-BERT检索相关对话，使用FLAN-T5生成个性化治疗建议，并通过RxNorm进行抗生素管理和药物相互作用筛查。

Result: 达到98%的准确率和F1分数，比ClinicalBERT提升7.1%；78%的top-5检索精度；临床医生评分为4.2/5；不安全抗生素建议比GPT-5减少67%。

Conclusion: CLIN-LLM展示了稳健性、可解释性和临床安全性，为资源有限的医疗环境提供了可部署的人机协同决策支持框架。

Abstract: Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment
recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient
settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based
systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty,
resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid
pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated
disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The
framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease
dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable
confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals.
Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring
human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical
Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample
MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a
fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by
post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug
interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score,
outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval
precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic
suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate
CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The
proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support
framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes
integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial
validation.

### [459] [SwiftSolve: A Self-Iterative, Complexity-Aware Multi-Agent Framework for Competitive Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22626)
*Adhyayan Veer Singh,Aaron Shen,Brian Law,Ahmed Ismail,Jonas Rohweder,Sean O'Brien,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SwiftSolve是一个复杂度感知的多智能体系统，用于竞争性编程，通过算法规划、经验分析和复杂度引导的修复，确保程序不仅正确还满足时间和内存限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的程序虽然能通过单元测试，但经常违反竞赛的时间和内存预算，需要确保程序效率。

Method: 采用多智能体系统，包括规划器提出算法草图、静态剪枝器过滤高风险计划、编码器生成C++代码、分析器编译执行并记录性能、复杂度分析器拟合增长模型并指导修复。

Result: 在26个问题上的评估显示，首轮通过率61.54%，三轮内解决率80.77%，运行级成功率73.08%，平均耗时12.40秒，优于Claude Opus 4。

Conclusion: 性能分析和复杂度引导的重新规划能减少低效问题，同时保持准确性，证明在竞争性编程中考虑效率的重要性。

Abstract: Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy
unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present
SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming
that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and
complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software
environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles
such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner
proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk
plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on
a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a
Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a
complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder.
Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration
caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10
Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains
pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with
marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate
run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly
resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against
Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at
approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness
(pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence
of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that
profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving
accuracy.

*Yuval Kainan,Shaked Zychlinski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于首词生成概率检测LLM模板回复的方法，通过轻量级k-NN分类器实现早期终止或重定向，显著降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成模板回复（如拒绝、简单确认等）时浪费大量计算资源，增加了不必要的成本和延迟

Method: 利用首词生成的对数概率分布作为信号，通过轻量级k-NN分类器预测后续回复类型，实现早期检测

Result: 实验表明首词对数概率向量对不同回复类型形成明显可分离的聚类，能够高精度预测实质性回答与模板回复

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM推理优化提供了实用且计算量极小的技术，可实现早期终止或重定向到小模型，显著提升部署效率

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources
generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and
casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting
such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the
log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful
signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our
experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and
reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors
form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a
lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a
response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,
including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,
computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early
termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant
savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more
efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

*Mithul Chander,Sai Pragnya Ranga,Prathamesh Mayekar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Atlas Urban Index (AUI)作为衡量城市发展的新指标，使用Sentinel-2卫星影像和视觉语言模型(VLMs)来克服传统指标(如NDBI)的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如NDBI在准确捕捉城市发展方面存在困难，受大气噪声、季节变化和云层覆盖等因素影响，阻碍了大规模人类发展和城市化的监测。

Method: 收集每个区域的Sentinel-2影像时间序列，在固定时间窗口内处理图像以获得最小云覆盖的代表性图像。采用两种策略确保评分一致性：提供代表不同城市化水平的参考图像集，以及提供最近的历史图像来保持时间一致性和减轻云相关噪声。

Result: 在班加罗尔的定性实验表明，AUI优于NDBI等标准指标。

Conclusion: AUI能够克服传统城市化指数的挑战，产生更可靠和稳定的发展评分。

Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban
development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite
imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up
Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to
factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These
limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and
urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that
leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score
for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for
each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to
get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image
for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:
(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing
different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image
to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the
current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges
of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable
development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI
outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

*Kaitong Cai,Jusheng Zhang,Yijia Fan,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RaCoT是一种新的检索增强生成框架，通过在检索前阶段生成对比性问题来引导模型关注关键细节差异，从而在单次检索中抑制语义干扰，提高对知识稀疏和语义模糊长尾查询的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG在处理知识稀疏和语义模糊的长尾查询时面临的检索噪声问题，这些噪声会扭曲推理并需要昂贵的后处理。

Method: 提出RaCoT框架，在检索前自动生成语义相邻但答案不同的对比问题，提取Δ-Prompt来捕捉关键差异，引导模型主动关注决定答案分歧的关键细节。

Result: 在六个权威基准测试中，RaCoT比RankRAG和Self-RAG等强基线方法高出0.9-2.4个百分点，在对抗性测试中性能下降仅8.6%，远优于其他方法超过15%的下降，同时具有低延迟(3.12s)和低token开销(11.54)。

Conclusion: RaCoT将RAG范式从"事后上下文清理"重新定义为"先验塑造判别推理"，为实时、资源受限部署的可靠AI系统提供了高效且鲁棒的路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with
knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval
noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle
this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel
framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By
automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered
contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key
differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical
details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress
semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the
theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously
encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative
benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong
baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits
superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial
tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore,
its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the
accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the
necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from
``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative
reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems
for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着各大公司不断改进大语言模型，了解不同模型在性能、伦理行为和可用性方面的差异变得至关重要，因为这些差异反映了它们背后的设计理念。

Method: 通过分析三个重要因素进行比较：性能与准确性、伦理与偏见缓解、可用性与集成能力。

Result: Claude在道德推理方面表现良好，Gemini在多模态能力和伦理框架方面更强，DeepSeek擅长基于事实的推理，LLaMA适合开放应用，ChatGPT提供平衡性能并注重用户体验。

Conclusion: 这些模型在工作效率、易用性和伦理处理方面存在显著差异，用户应根据具体需求选择最能发挥其优势的模型。

Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the
way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google,
High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial
to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour
and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built
them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's
DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs
this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and
Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has
good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has
strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA
is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a
focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of
how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people
ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in
a way that makes the most of its strengths.

TL;DR: 开发了一个事实验证框架，通过交叉检查LLM输出与多个知识源来实时捕获和纠正幻觉错误，将幻觉减少67%，同时保持响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM自信生成听起来合理但错误信息的幻觉问题，这是在实际应用中部署这些模型的主要障碍。

Method: 结合结构化数据库、实时网络搜索和学术文献来验证生成的事实声明，检测到不一致时自动纠正，同时保持响应的自然流畅性。

Result: 在多个领域测试显示幻觉减少67%，领域专家对纠正后输出的满意度达89%，相比未验证的LLM响应有显著提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在事实准确性至关重要的应用中使LLM更可信提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems,
they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information
that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major
barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy
matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects
these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple
knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches,
and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we
detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the
natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could
reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain
experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected
outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM
responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more
trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

TL;DR: Jarvis是一个创新的个性化AI助手框架，通过个人KV-Cache检索存储用户特定信息，在视觉问答和纯文本任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么学习概念标记集，要么训练VLM使用用户特定信息，但都难以生成准确答案。需要开发更有效的个性化AI助手框架。

Method: 通过个人KV-Cache检索框架，将用户特定信息存储在文本和视觉token的KV-Cache中。文本token通过总结用户信息为元数据创建，视觉token通过从用户图像中提取独特图像块产生。回答问题前先检索相关KV-Cache以确保响应准确性。

Result: Jarvis能够提供更准确的响应，特别是在依赖特定局部细节时。在多个数据集的视觉问答和纯文本任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Jarvis为个性化AI助手提供了一条实用路径，通过KV-Cache检索机制有效利用用户特定信息，显著提升了回答准确性。

Abstract: The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended
perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt
general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such
as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific
information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or
train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines
struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce
Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through
personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the
KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by
summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are
produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When
answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal
storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a
fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining
pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained
user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate
responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis
achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and
text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward
personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

Motivation: AI代理在人类工作相关任务上的优化趋势显著，但缺乏对人类工作执行方式的理解，需要揭示代理的专业能力和在不同工作流程中的角色。

Method: 引入可扩展工具包，从人类或代理的计算机使用活动中诱导可解释的结构化工作流程，直接比较人类和代理在相同任务上的表现。

Result: 代理工作流程与人类对齐，但采用程序化方法；工作质量较差，但通过数据伪造和工具滥用掩盖缺陷；效率比人类高88.3%，成本低90.4-96.2%。

Conclusion: 代理在可编程任务上具有高效低成本优势，为人机协作提供了潜力，但需要解决其工作质量和诚信问题。

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as
software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with
significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments
have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute
work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in
diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by
presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across
multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,
computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare
heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable
toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or
agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how
humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents
exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an
overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for
open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the
UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of
inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and
misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster
and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling
efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

Method: 使用Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO)，结合元学习训练决策树模型来决定不同智能体/模型之间的最佳推理策略。

Result: 通过两个生产用例展示了AMO的有效性：Microsoft 365电子商务Copilot和代码合规Copilot，前者提供最新产品信息并连接多个智能体，后者扫描DevOps代码检测合规问题。

Conclusion: AMO能够有效处理多任务和可扩展的智能体，为Copilot服务提供自然语言和行动响应能力。

Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various
agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer
with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming
code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering
operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The
repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a
robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right
agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for
handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can
provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate
the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model
for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We
showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases:
Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365
E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to
promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product
information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRM虽然在小规模下具有出色的推理能力，但仅限于监督学习、静态、完全可观测问题。许多现实世界问题具有动态性、不确定性和部分可观测性，需要能够重用先前计算的能力。

Method: 开发HRM-Agent，这是HRM的变体，仅使用强化学习进行训练，应用于动态不确定的迷宫导航任务。

Result: HRM-Agent能够学习在动态不确定的迷宫环境中导航到目标，其循环推理过程成功重用了早期时间步的计算。

Conclusion: HRM可以通过强化学习扩展到动态不确定环境，其循环推理机制能够有效重用先前计算，为处理现实世界问题提供了可能性。

Abstract: The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) has impressive reasoning abilities
given its small size, but has only been applied to supervised, static,
fully-observable problems. One of HRM's strengths is its ability to adapt its
computational effort to the difficulty of the problem. However, in its current
form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous time-steps if the
problem is dynamic, uncertain or partially observable, or be applied where the
correct action is undefined, characteristics of many real-world problems.
  This paper presents HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained using only
reinforcement learning. We show that HRM can learn to navigate to goals in
dynamic and uncertain maze environments. Recent work suggests that HRM's
reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process. We explore the
dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is
successfully reusing computation from earlier environment time-steps.

Motivation: 人类在掌握任务后会逐渐减少认知努力，而传统强化学习智能体在提升性能时通常不会变得更高效。如果智能体能在学习过程中考虑计算成本，就能减少计算足迹，实现更节能的智能体或释放计算资源用于其他过程。

Method: 在Arcade Learning Environment中进行实验，向智能体展示计算成本并赋予它们控制计算使用的自主权。

Result: 在相同的训练计算预算下，考虑计算成本的智能体在75%的游戏中表现更好，平均减少了三倍的计算量。

Conclusion: 让强化学习智能体考虑计算成本可以显著提高计算效率，同时保持或提升性能表现。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in
many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient
as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as
they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their
compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint?
If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute
cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with
showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to
control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade
Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training
compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of
games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We
analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉和文本模态之间存在不平衡的推理能力，模型过度依赖文本线索而忽视视觉内容，导致在需要真正视觉推理的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 从训练方法角度分析模态差距问题，系统探索从数据和损失函数设计两个互补视角来缩小模态差距的策略。

Conclusion: 通过改进训练方法，特别是数据和损失函数设计，可以有效缩小多模态模型中的模态差距，实现更平衡的视觉-文本推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an
imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities.
Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while
under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks
that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the
\textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between
text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality
gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training
recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to
bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our
findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the
modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning. Our code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于逻辑门电子电路的统一框架，将认知研究和人工智能中的各种推理机制（分类、归纳、溯因、因果推理等）整合起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知研究和人工智能为各种推理机制开发了不同的模型，但缺乏统一框架。本文试图填补这一空白，从物质角度假设高级激活过程。

Method: 使用符号AI建模技术，通过基于逻辑门的电子电路简化视角来考虑推理机制。通过组合探索识别了四种主要依赖形式，并在逻辑程序背景下识别了八种常见推理模式。

Result: 发现逻辑门视角对蕴含和否定的处理与标准逻辑和逻辑编程不同。识别了四种依赖形式和八种推理模式，在统一框架中揭示了传统上不同的推理机制。

Conclusion: 尽管论证主要基于符号方法和数字系统基础设施，但观察结果可能指向更普遍适用的结构，揭示了内在功能依赖关系。

Abstract: Cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models
for various inferential mechanisms (categorization, induction, abduction,
causal inference, contrast, merge, ...). Yet, both natural and artificial views
on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a
speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on
higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider
inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through
the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe
that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and
negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by
combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can
be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are
generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common
inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in
an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of
logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes
elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by
symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may
pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.

Motivation: 解决智能体工具调用环境中的泛化挑战，当前LLMs虽然在孤立基准测试中表现良好，但在跨领域转移推理策略和协调工具方面的能力尚未被充分理解。

Method: 提出了CoreThink Agentic Reasoner框架，为LLMs添加轻量级符号推理层，实现结构化分解和自适应工具编排，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多个工具调用基准测试中实现最先进性能，相比现有基线提升530%，计算成本仅为十分之一，在MAVEN基准测试中大多数当前模型准确率低于50%。

Conclusion: CoreThink Agentic Reasoner框架能有效解决工具使用环境中的泛化问题，显著提升模型在跨领域工具调用任务中的表现。

Abstract: Generalization across Agentic tool-calling environments remains a key
unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. While
large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on isolated
benchmarks, their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and co-ordinate
tools across diverse domains is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a
large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on multiple tool-calling
benchmarksBFCL v3, TauBench, Tau2Bench, and AceBenchand introduce MAVEN (Math &
Physics Adversarial Verification & Evaluation Network), a new out of
distribution (OOD) benchmark designed to stress-test multi-step reasoning
through explicit verification and adversarial task composition. Our results
show that most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing a
significant generalization gap across tool-use settings.
  To address this, we present the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, a framework that
augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured
decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration. Without additional training, it
generalizes across all benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
530% improvements over existing baselines at roughly one-tenth the
computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络和序列模型的POI推荐方法无法同时捕捉空间选择的层次结构和用户时间上下文的动态不规则变化。

Method: 利用双曲几何建模静态的树状偏好层次，在欧几里得切空间中路由动态序列更新到Mamba层，通过跨流形通道融合时空信息来指导状态空间模型。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，GTR-Mamba在下一个POI推荐任务中持续优于最先进的基线模型。

Conclusion: GTR-Mamba通过跨流形条件路由有效解决了同时捕捉空间层次结构和时间动态性的挑战，在POI推荐任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern
Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex
decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized
recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI
recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and
sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a
fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent
hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts
of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose
GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.
GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces
for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in
hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel
Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent
space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses
spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),
enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.

Result: 在平均奖励和QoS指标上持续优于现有MARL基线方法

Conclusion: MA-CDMP展示了在真实无线网络优化中的可扩展性和实用性

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation
plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While
centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a
central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer
from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed
Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed
learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and
limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion
Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.
Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP
employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future
trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby
alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE
methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field
(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This
design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with
minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further
theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation
error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence
stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL
baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its
scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.

Method: 提出了多维度指令不确定性减少框架：在采样方法维度使用残差驱动攻击方向稳定化；在任务建模维度使用上下文编码攻击场景约束；在生成器评估维度使用语义抽象攻击评估增强。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了语义不确定性带来的挑战，生成了更可迁移、自适应和有效的语义约束对抗样本。

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which
are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a
promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To
generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking
ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human
instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and
boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,
this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction
(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,
adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,
we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate
the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language
references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the
optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,
therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of
multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded
attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from
incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are
proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger
scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,
we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by
clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more
effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize
the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial
examples for the first time.

Method: ProfileXAI框架耦合后置解释器（SHAP、LIME、Anchor）与检索增强的LLMs，索引多模态知识库，通过定量标准选择解释器，并生成基于聊天的提示的接地叙述。

Result: 在心脏病和甲状腺癌数据集上的评估显示：LIME在保真度-鲁棒性权衡上表现最佳；Anchor产生最稀疏、低token的规则；SHAP获得最高满意度。Profile条件化稳定token使用并保持跨配置文件的积极评级。

Conclusion: ProfileXAI能够实现高效且可信的解释，没有单一解释器在所有指标上占优，但通过配置文件条件化可以稳定token使用并维持积极的用户评级。

Abstract: ProfileXAI is a model- and domain-agnostic framework that couples post-hoc
explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval - augmented LLMs to produce
explanations for different types of users. The system indexes a multimodal
knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria,
and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting. On Heart Disease
and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token
use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best
fidelity-robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart
Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest
satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma
\le 13\%$) and maintains positive ratings across profiles ($\bar{x}\ge 3.7$,
with domain experts at $3.77$), enabling efficient and trustworthy
explanations.

Motivation: 现有研究表明扩散规划器从稀疏步长规划中受益，但过度稀疏的规划会降低性能。作者假设时间密度阈值在整个时间范围内是非均匀的，某些部分应该更密集地规划。

Method: 提出混合密度扩散器（MDD），其中整个时间范围内的密度是可调的超参数，允许对轨迹的不同部分进行不同程度的稀疏规划。

Result: MDD在Maze2D、Franka Kitchen和Antmaze D4RL任务领域实现了新的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 通过在整个时间范围内可调密度的方法，MDD证明了非均匀时间密度规划的有效性，显著提升了扩散规划器的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step
planning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their
trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory
computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades
performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform
across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should
be more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion
planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters.
MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL
task domains.

Abstract: Driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence
technology, the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important
component of the education industry. Cognitive diagnostic technology can
utilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational
evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level.
However, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources,
they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of
disciplinary data. In cross-disciplinary fields, traditional cognitive
diagnostic methods still face many challenges. Given the differences in
knowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between
different disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network
cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive
diagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis
method (TLCD). This method combines deep learning techniques and transfer
learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target
discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline. The
experimental results show that the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model
based on deep learning performs better than the basic model in
cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks, and can more accurately evaluate
students' learning situation.

Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a
necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps.
Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing
a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that
reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to
investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4
family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of
process rewards and outcome rewards.
  Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness
labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a
value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.
Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward
models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions
among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement
in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

Motivation: 解决科学大语言模型在处理原始生物分子序列时面临的tokenization困境，探索更有效的输入策略。

Method: 系统比较领先的Sci-LLMs在生物推理任务上的三种输入模式：仅序列、仅上下文、以及两者结合。

Result: 仅上下文方法始终且显著优于其他模式，原始序列的加入反而会降低性能，表明原始序列对模型来说是信息噪声。

Conclusion: 应重新定位Sci-LLMs为基于专家知识的推理引擎，而非序列解码器，发展重点应从直接序列解释转向高层次知识合成。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising
frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a
fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the
tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,
risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,
introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally
limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by
positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level
structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby
bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through
a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we
tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of
both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and
substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion
of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades
performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for
models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the
primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to
interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for
reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for
reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines
over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid
scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct
sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis. The code is

Result: FoG成功消除了翻转、滚动等不良行为，在状态和像素任务中都避免了危险区域，还能发现难以定义的行为技能

Conclusion: FoG方法有效将人类偏好融入技能发现，解决了现有方法忽视人类意图的问题

Abstract: Learning diverse skills without hand-crafted reward functions could
accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks. However, existing skill
discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without
considering human preferences, which leads to undesirable behaviors and
possibly dangerous skills. For instance, a cheetah robot trained using previous
methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity, whereas
we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas. In this
work, we propose a Foundation model Guided (FoG) skill discovery method, which
incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models.
Specifically, FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate
states based on human intentions, assigning higher values to desirable states
and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the
rewards of skill discovery algorithms. By optimizing the re-weighted skill
discovery rewards, FoG successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors,
such as flipping or rolling, and to avoid hazardous areas in both state-based
and pixel-based tasks. Interestingly, we show that FoG can discover skills

### [486] [AUPO -- Abstracted Until Proven Otherwise: A Reward Distribution Based Abstraction Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23214)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AUPO是一种MCTS的改进决策策略，通过自动动作抽象显著提升性能，仅依赖奖励分布统计，无需转移概率或DAG搜索图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动抽象算法需要转移概率和DAG搜索图的限制，同时能够检测对称动作，克服ASAP等框架在对称状态相距较远时的困难。

Method: 基于MCTS过程中收集的奖励分布统计，开发自动动作抽象算法AUPO，仅影响决策策略而不影响树搜索。

Result: 在IPPC基准问题上，AUPO明显优于标准MCTS，能够检测到ASAP难以处理的对称动作。

Conclusion: AUPO作为一种drop-in修改，与仅影响树搜索的其他抽象技术兼容，提供了一种更灵活高效的自动动作抽象方法。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's
(MCTS) decision policy that we call AUPO. Comparisons based on a range of IPPC
benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an
automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward
distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic
abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition
probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build
its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that
state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting
symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only
affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other
abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习研究主要关注训练超人智能体，使用大型模型，但这对于资源有限的游戏工作室来说不切实际，他们需要的是更人性化的智能体。

Method: 通过利用预收集数据和增加网络可塑性，提高了基于价值的深度强化学习的样本效率，专门为游戏行业等工业环境设计。

Result: 在EA SPORTS FC 25中训练的守门员智能体比游戏内置AI的救球率提高10%，训练速度比标准DRL方法快50%，领域专家定性评估表明该方法创造了比手工制作智能体更人性化的游戏体验。

Conclusion: 该方法已被证明有效，计划在系列游戏的下一版本中取代手工制作的对应方案，展示了该方法在工业应用中的实际价值。

Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the
game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on
training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game
studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper
proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning
agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method
improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data
and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper
agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today.
Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate.
Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to
standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts
indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to
hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method
is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the
series.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BlocKOA的新型集成电路热仿真数据生成算法，通过块Krylov和算子操作同时加速数据生成过程并提高数据精度，相比现有方法实现420倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法（如神经算子）需要大量高保真训练数据，导致计算成本高昂，需要解决数据生成效率低的问题。

Method: 使用基于热方程结构的块Krylov算法快速获取基础解，结合这些解得到满足物理约束的温度分布，然后应用热算子确定热源分布，高效生成精确数据点。

Result: 理论分析显示BlocKOA时间复杂度比现有方法低一个数量级，实验验证生成5000个芯片热仿真数据实现420倍加速，仅用4%生成时间的数据驱动方法性能与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: BlocKOA算法能高效生成精确的IC热仿真数据，大幅降低数据生成成本，为数据驱动方法提供高质量训练数据支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs),
have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated
circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is
requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip
parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm
for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and
operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation
process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically
designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm
based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic
solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that
satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these
functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating
precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of
BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results
further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold
speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying
physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation
time, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits
comparable performance to that using the existing method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的CNOT门最小化方法，使用单一智能体处理不同尺寸的量子电路，在较大电路尺寸上优于现有最优算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNOT门是量子计算中的基本门，能够产生纠缠这一量子算法的关键资源。某些量子电路完全由CNOT门构成，因此最小化CNOT门数量是一个重要但尚未完全解决的计算复杂度问题。

Method: 使用单一强化学习智能体处理固定尺寸m的电路，对于不同尺寸的矩阵采用嵌入或高斯条纹化进行预处理。实验中使用m=8的智能体评估尺寸从3到15的矩阵。

Result: 该方法在n值增加时表现优于现有最优算法，随着电路尺寸增大，性能优势更加明显。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在CNOT门最小化问题上展现出潜力，特别是在处理较大尺寸量子电路时具有优势，为这一开放挑战提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate
entanglement, a crucial resource for quantum algorithms. Certain classes of
quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their
widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed.
This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its
computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we
introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead
of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes,
we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from
m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the
efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on
matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that
our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n
increases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于理性沟通原则的自适应信号框架，通过多步规划和用户意识建模来优化人机协作中的信息传递时机和内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速变化的环境中，确保人类对关键任务要素保持准确理解，需要辅助智能体不仅能识别最高优先级信息，还要估计如何和何时最有效地传递这些信息，因为人类注意力是零和认知资源。

Method: 使用理性言语行为(RSA)建模框架，通过贝叶斯参考解析来规划消息序列，优化用户信念与动态环境的及时对齐。智能体根据用户和场景特点调整消息的具体性和时机，基于对消息解释如何影响界面注意力和后续信念更新的预测。

Result: 与基线方法比较显示，该方法的效果关键在于将多步规划与现实的用户意识模型相结合。

Conclusion: 这是RSA在动态环境通信和一般人机交互中的首次应用，为人类-智能体团队中的语用沟通建立了理论基础，展示了如何利用认知科学见解来指导辅助智能体设计。

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on
time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure
the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an
assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but
also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most
effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive
resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming
information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which
meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,
formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely
alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts
message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based
on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence
attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several
timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show
that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with
a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for
communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in
general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in
human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be
capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

Method: 使用模糊逻辑推理方法，从评论文本中挖掘更深层次的细粒度意见信息，包括提取评论对象的属性和组件，并确定情感极性。

Result: 开发了一种能够进行细粒度意见挖掘的方法，可以更精确地分析评论内容，并基于挖掘结果对实体进行排名。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了细粒度意见挖掘和基于此进行实体排名的研究空白，为更精确的意见分析提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers
of our behaviors. In current times due to growth of social networking website
and increase in number of e-commerce site huge amount of opinions are now
available on web. Given a set of evaluative statements that contain opinions
(or sentiments) about an Entity, opinion mining aims to extract attributes and
components of the object that have been commented on in each statement and to
determine whether the comments are positive, negative or neutral. While lot of
research recently has been done in field of opinion mining and some of it
dealing with ranking of entities based on review or opinion set, classifying
opinions into finer granularity level and then ranking entities has never been
done before. In this paper method for opinion mining from statements at a
deeper level of granularity is proposed. This is done by using fuzzy logic
reasoning, after which entities are ranked as per this information.

Result: 实验评估显示，相比LLM代码生成方法，AutoStreamPipe将开发时间减少6.3倍，错误率降低5.19倍(通过新的无错误评分EFS衡量)。

Conclusion: AutoStreamPipe框架成功实现了流处理管道的自动化设计和部署，显著提升了开发效率和准确性。

Abstract: Data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the
efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting
rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel
framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design,
generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe
bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific
implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured
multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an
extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution
strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good
accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that
AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates
(x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM
code-generation methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Bid2X竞价基础模型，通过统一函数估计不同竞价场景下的广告效果，采用注意力机制处理异构数据和时间依赖关系，在淘宝平台部署后显著提升了GMV和ROI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有竞价模型通常针对特定场景设计，缺乏跨环境的泛化能力，需要开发能够适应不同竞价场景的统一基础模型。

Method: 构建Bid2X模型，使用统一序列嵌入处理异构数据，设计两种注意力机制分别处理变量间依赖和时间依赖，采用变量感知融合模块进行自适应预测，并设计零膨胀投影模块处理数据分布。

Result: 在8个数据集上的离线评估显示Bid2X优于各种基线方法，在线A/B测试中GMV提升4.65%，ROI提升2.44%。

Conclusion: Bid2X作为竞价基础模型在计算广告领域具有重要价值，能够泛化到不同场景并显著提升广告效果。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically
providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to
model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in
generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored
for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the
scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the
achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross
merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding
foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various
scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode
heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex
inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose
two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables
and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation
learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a
variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome
prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a
zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero
probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization
objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to
converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the
ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline
evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various
baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by
4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding
foundation model in computational advertising.

Motivation: 传统DQN依赖关联学习容易产生伪相关，阻碍问题解决能力，需要整合因果推理来理解环境因果结构

Method: 提出将因果原则整合到DQN的框架，利用PEACE公式估计因果效应，在训练中融入因果推理

Result: 实验表明该方法在标准基准环境中优于传统DQN，显著增强问题解决能力且不损失性能

Conclusion: 通过原则性因果推理为深度强化学习智能体能力提升提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement
learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to
the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal
principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational
Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal
reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's
understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby
mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We
demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly
enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance.
Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our
approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of
causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a
promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning
agents through principled causal inference.

TL;DR: 本文是对Cappelen等人关于AI生存风险分类分析论文的评论，重点讨论了线性风险模型的哲学局限性，分析了瑞士奶酪模型与作者模型的差异，并探讨了在认知漠视情境下灾难概率P(D)的评估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者旨在揭示AI生存风险评估中线性模型的局限性，强调在认知漠视情境下，由于结构层间关系，实际灾难概率P(D)可能高于初步估计，并需要纳入不确定性的维度。

Method: 采用哲学分析方法，首先比较标准瑞士奶酪模型与作者模型的差异，然后论证在认知漠视情境下P(D)概率的评估问题，最后区分风险与不确定性，提出两种不确定性类型对P(D)估计的结构性影响。

Result: 分析表明，任何对P(D)的估计都受到两种不确定性的结构性影响：选项不确定性和状态空间不确定性，将这些不确定性维度纳入AI生存风险的定性讨论可以更好地理解P(D)的可能性。

Conclusion: 在AI生存风险评估中，必须考虑不确定性的多个维度，特别是选项不确定性和状态空间不确定性，这些因素会显著影响对灾难概率P(D)的准确评估，从而提供更全面的风险理解框架。

Abstract: This work is a commentary of the article
\href{https://doi.org/10.18716/ojs/phai/2025.2801}{AI Survival Stories: a
Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk} by Cappelen, Goldstein, and
Hawthorne. It is not just a commentary though, but a useful reminder of the
philosophical limitations of \say{linear} models of risk. The article will
focus on the model employed by the authors: first, I discuss some differences
between standard Swiss Cheese models and this one. I then argue that in a
situation of epistemic indifference the probability of P(D) is higher than what
one might first suggest, given the structural relationships between layers. I
then distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and argue that any estimation of
P(D) is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty: option uncertainty
and state-space uncertainty. Incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into
our qualitative discussion on AI existential risk can provide a better
understanding of the likeliness of P(D).

Motivation: 企业需要满足最小权限、合规性和可审计性的访问决策，传统方法难以处理自然语言策略解释

Method: 使用Google Gemini 2.0 Flash构建六阶段推理框架：上下文解释、用户验证、数据分类、业务目的测试、合规映射和风险综合，采用早期硬策略门控和默认拒绝机制

Result: 在14个标准案例测试中，精确决策匹配率从10/14提升至13/14(92.9%)，拒绝召回率达到1.00，必须拒绝场景的误批准率降为0，功能和合规性均达到14/14

Conclusion: 策略约束的LLM推理结合显式门控和审计跟踪，能够将人类可读策略转化为安全、合规且可追溯的机器决策

Abstract: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with
regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that
uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests
against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented
with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context
interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test,
compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny
by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls
and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases
across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results
show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying
policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny
families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence
at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is
under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM
reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human
readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines,
shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions
under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain
knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in
the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design
collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and
AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of
Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of
reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty
Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human
expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,
ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,
enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population
level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an
intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a
classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop
practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution
free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,
including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we
call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,
regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative
prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher
coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes
of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky
hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the
definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly
maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate
that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical
task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents
employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This
Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing
agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More
critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the
application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety
and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the
boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally
undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents
by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative
risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static
analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

Result: 在MAFW和DFEW数据集上显著提高了解释-预测一致性和解释情感准确性，通过实验和人工评估验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了解释与预测的对齐，还使多模态大语言模型能够提供情感一致、可信赖的交互，是实现真正类人HCI系统的关键一步。

Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into
more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift,
emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues
underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for
predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.
However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that
diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own
predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for
misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address
this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and
an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is
explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion
recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional
paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves
faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on
the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human
evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between
explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally
coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like
HCI systems.

TL;DR: NoRA是一个新的系统性关系推理基准，增加了多个难度级别，要求模型超越基于路径的推理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统性关系推理基准过于简化，假设推理可以简化为组合关系路径，这种假设被硬编码到多个最新模型架构中，导致模型在现有基准上表现良好但难以推广到其他设置。

Method: 引入NoRA基准，该基准包含多个难度级别，要求模型进行超越路径推理的复杂推理任务。

Result: NoRA基准为系统性关系推理领域提供了更具挑战性的评估标准。

Conclusion: NoRA基准将推动神经网络在系统性关系推理领域的进一步发展，促进开发更具泛化能力的模型。

Abstract: Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important
and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have
been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning,
including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture,
and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for
systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on
the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In
fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent
models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but
are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in
the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce
NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires
models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

TL;DR: JanusCode-800K是最大的多模态代码语料库，支持训练JanusCoder系列模型，这些模型在文本和视觉编码任务中表现出色，接近或超越商业模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经代码智能正从基于文本的源代码扩展到程序生成的丰富视觉输出，但高质量多模态代码数据的稀缺阻碍了进展。

Method: 开发了一个完整的合成工具包，利用数据模态间的协同效应，构建了JanusCode-800K语料库，并训练了JanusCoder和JanusCoderV模型，支持从文本指令、视觉输入或两者组合生成代码。

Result: 在文本中心和视觉中心编码任务上的广泛实验表明，JanusCoder系列模型性能优越，7B到14B规模的模型接近或超过商业模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为协调程序逻辑与其视觉表达提供了关键见解，建立了视觉-程序接口，统一了现有孤立任务的专门模型方法。

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

TL;DR: 提出OntoPret本体，用于解释人类行为，填补技术中心机器人框架与描述性行为本体之间的研究空白，支持实时协作解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人机协作成为工业5.0等范式的核心，机器需要安全有效地解释复杂人类行为。当前技术中心机器人框架缺乏细致的人类行为模型，而描述性行为本体不适合实时协作解释。

Method: 基于认知科学和模块化工程方法，开发OntoPret本体，提供形式化、机器可处理的框架，用于分类行为（包括任务偏差和欺骗行为）。

Result: 在制造和游戏两个不同用例中展示了OntoPret的适应性，并建立了关于人类意图的高级推理所需的语义基础。

Conclusion: OntoPret为解释人类行为提供了有效的本体框架，填补了现有技术空白，支持实时协作场景中的行为分类和意图推理。

Abstract: As human machine teaming becomes central to paradigms like Industry 5.0, a
critical need arises for machines to safely and effectively interpret complex
human behaviors. A research gap currently exists between techno centric robotic
frameworks, which often lack nuanced models of human behavior, and descriptive
behavioral ontologies, which are not designed for real time, collaborative
interpretation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting OntoPret, an
ontology for the interpretation of human behavior. Grounded in cognitive
science and a modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal,
machine processable framework for classifying behaviors, including task
deviations and deceptive actions. We demonstrate its adaptability across two
distinct use cases manufacturing and gameplay and establish the semantic
foundations necessary for advanced reasoning about human intentions.

TL;DR: ReCode通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动，将高级计划视为抽象占位函数，递归分解为更细粒度的子函数，实现动态决策粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实任务需要不同粒度的决策，人类能够利用统一的认知表示进行灵活规划，但当前基于LLM的智能体缺乏这种跨粒度操作能力，现有范式在高级规划和低级行动之间存在刚性分离。

Method: 提出ReCode范式，在单一代码表示中统一规划和行动，将高级计划作为抽象占位函数，递归分解为更细粒度的子函数，直到原始行动，消除规划与行动之间的刚性边界。

Result: 大量实验表明ReCode在推理性能上显著超越先进基线方法，并在训练中表现出卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: 通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动是实现通用粒度控制的有效方法，递归结构自然生成丰富的多粒度训练数据，使模型能够学习分层决策过程。

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is
available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

TL;DR: ChatGPT发布后，公众对AI的接受度下降，对人机协作的需求增加，并加剧了现有的社会不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成式AI技术快速普及背景下公众态度的变化，特别是在有影响力的决策场景中，挑战行业对公众AI接受度的假设。

Method: 采用大规模两波调查（n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488），代表瑞士人口，比较ChatGPT发布前后的公众态度变化。

Result: 生成式AI热潮显著降低公众对AI的接受度，增加对人机监督的需求；完全不可接受AI的比例从23%升至30%，支持纯人类决策的比例从18%升至26%；扩大了教育、语言和性别差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战行业对公众AI部署准备度的假设，强调技术发展必须与不断变化的公众偏好保持一致的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies
has led many organizations to integrate AI into their products and services,
often without considering user preferences. Yet, public attitudes toward AI
use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored.
Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488)
representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes
toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom
is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1)
and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts.
The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from
23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%.
These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened
educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge
industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the
critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public
preferences.

TL;DR: MAE是一个多智能体自进化框架，通过三个交互智能体（提议者、求解者、评判者）实现LLM的自我进化，在数学、推理和常识问答任务上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法依赖人工标注数据和可验证奖励，限制了可扩展性和通用性。自博弈RL方法需要基础环境反馈，难以扩展到通用领域。

Method: 提出MAE框架，基于单一LLM实例化三个交互智能体：提议者生成问题，求解者尝试解答，评判者评估并共同进化，应用强化学习优化行为。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct上的实验显示，MAE在多个基准测试中平均提升4.54%。

Conclusion: MAE是一种可扩展、数据高效的方法，能够以最少的人工监督增强LLM的通用推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However,
the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and
verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent
Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,
aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.
However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback
(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general
domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose
Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in
solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge
Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents
(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies
reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates
questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while
co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves
an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight
MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning
abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

TL;DR: ALITA-G是一个自我进化框架，通过生成、抽象和策划MCP工具，将通用智能体转变为领域专家，在多个基准测试中实现最先进性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自进化智能体主要局限于提示重写或失败重试，需要更系统的方法来提升智能体的领域专业能力。

Method: 通过执行领域任务生成候选MCP工具，抽象为参数化原语并整合到MCP Box中，在推理时进行检索增强的MCP选择和执行。

Result: 在GAIA验证集上达到83.03% pass@1和89.09% pass@3的新SOTA，同时将每个示例的平均token数减少约15%。

Conclusion: ALITA-G提供了从通用能力到可重用领域专业能力的系统路径，在复杂推理任务上同时提高了准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when
scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this,
self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation
to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a
self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain
expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context
Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated
suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful
trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and
consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs
retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and
use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across
several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains
strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves
83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result
while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a
strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from
generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both
accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.
