Abstract: We present CageDroneRF (CDRF), a large-scale benchmark for Radio-Frequency (RF) drone detection and identification built from real-world captures and systematically generated synthetic variants. CDRF addresses the scarcity and limited diversity of existing RF datasets by coupling extensive raw recordings with a principled augmentation pipeline that (i) precisely controls Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) injects interfering emitters, and (iii) applies frequency shifts with label-consistent bounding-box transformations for detection. This dataset spans a wide range of contemporary drone models, many unavailable in current public datasets, and acquisition conditions, derived from data collected at the Rowan University campus and within a controlled RF-cage facility. CDRF is released with interoperable open-source tools for data generation, preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation that also operate on existing public benchmarks. CDRF enables standardized benchmarking for classification, open-set recognition, and object detection, supporting rigorous comparisons and reproducible pipelines. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark and tooling, CDRF aims to accelerate progress toward robust, generalizable RF perception models.

### [3] [Mass Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Concept Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03305)
*Jiahang Tu,Ye Li,Yiming Wu,Hanbin Zhao,Chao Zhang,Hui Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于超类型-子类型概念层次的概念擦除方法，通过SuPLoRA技术实现高效多概念擦除，同时保持生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型概念擦除方法在处理多个概念时效率低下且效果不佳，每个概念需要单独微调参数，且随着擦除概念增多会降低整体生成质量

Method: 构建超类型-子类型概念层次结构，将语义相关概念分组；提出SuPLoRA方法，在冻结的下投影矩阵中编码超类型概念信息，仅更新上投影矩阵；使用标准扩散正则化保护未掩码区域的去噪过程

Result: 构建了更具挑战性的基准测试，涵盖名人、物体和色情内容等多个领域的概念同时擦除；理论分析证明SuPLoRA能有效减轻生成性能退化

Conclusion: 提出的超类型-子类型层次结构和SuPLoRA方法能够高效、有效地同时擦除多个相关概念，同时保持模型的整体生成能力

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has raised concerns about the generation of unsafe or harmful content, prompting concept erasure approaches that fine-tune modules to suppress specific concepts while preserving general generative capabilities. However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.

TL;DR: VLM4VLA框架揭示：VLM通用能力不能预测下游VLA策略性能，视觉模块是主要瓶颈，控制相关监督能提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLM选择与能力如何影响下游VLA策略性能，挑战现有假设，探索VLM能力与具身控制之间的关系

Method: 提出VLM4VLA最小适应框架，仅学习少量新参数，在三个基准测试上进行广泛实证研究，分析VLM初始化、具身能力微调、模态消融等

Result: VLM初始化有优势但通用能力不能预测下游性能；提升特定具身技能不保证更好控制；视觉模块是主要瓶颈；注入控制监督能提升性能

Conclusion: 标准VLM能力对具身控制必要但不充分，当前VLM预训练目标与具身动作规划需求存在领域差距，视觉编码器是关键改进方向

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into their policy backbone, are gaining significant attention for their promising generalization capabilities. This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.

### [5] [Klear: Unified Multi-Task Audio-Video Joint Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04151)
*Jun Wang,Chunyu Qiang,Yuxin Guo,Yiran Wang,Xijuan Zeng,Chen Zhang,Pengfei Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Klear是一个音频-视频联合生成系统，通过改进模型架构、训练策略和数据构建，解决了现有方法中的音频-视频异步、唇语对齐差和单模态退化等问题，在联合和单模态生成任务上都取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频-视频联合生成方法存在音频-视频异步、唇语-语音对齐不佳、单模态退化等问题，这些问题源于音频-视频对应建模弱、泛化能力有限以及高质量密集标注数据稀缺。

Method: 采用三轴方法：1) 架构上使用单塔设计，统一DiT块和Omni-Full Attention机制；2) 训练上采用渐进式多任务策略，包括随机模态掩码和多阶段课程学习；3) 数据上构建首个大规模带密集标注的音频-视频数据集，并开发自动化数据构建流水线。

Result: Klear在各项任务上大幅超越先前方法，在联合和单模态设置下都能生成高保真、语义和时间对齐的指令跟随内容，并能鲁棒地泛化到分布外场景，性能可与Veo 3相媲美。

Conclusion: Klear提供了一个统一、可扩展的路径，通过改进架构、训练和数据构建，解决了音频-视频合成中的关键挑战，为下一代音频-视频合成技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.

*Yun-Hao Zhang,I-Hsien Ting,Dario Liberona,Yun-Hsiu Liu,Kazunori Minetaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用深度学习图像识别技术对刚捕捞的白虾进行自动分类，替代人工分拣，提高分类准确性和效率，保持虾的新鲜度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着信息技术融入水产养殖，产量稳定增长。消费者对高品质水产品需求增加，新鲜度和外观完整性是关键问题。虾类加工食品在捕捞后新鲜度迅速下降，软壳虾在烹饪或冷冻后常出现头身分离，影响产品外观和消费者感知。

Method: 采用基于深度学习的图像识别技术，使用卷积神经网络（CNN）模型对刚捕捞的白虾进行自动分类，替代传统人工分拣方法。

Result: CNN模型提高了分类准确性、效率和一致性，减少了处理时间，有助于保持虾的新鲜度，使虾类运输企业能更有效地满足客户需求。

Conclusion: 深度学习图像识别技术能够有效解决虾类分拣问题，提高产品质量和生产效率，满足市场对高品质水产品的需求。

Abstract: With the integration of information technology into aquaculture, production has become more stable and continues to grow annually. As consumer demand for high-quality aquatic products rises, freshness and appearance integrity are key concerns. In shrimp-based processed foods, freshness declines rapidly post-harvest, and soft-shell shrimp often suffer from head-body separation after cooking or freezing, affecting product appearance and consumer perception. To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model replaces manual sorting, enhancing classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency. By reducing processing time, this technology helps maintain freshness and ensures that shrimp transportation businesses meet customer demands more effectively.

### [7] [Higher order PCA-like rotation-invariant features for detailed shape descriptors modulo rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03326)
*Jarek Duda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用高阶张量（三阶及以上）扩展PCA的协方差矩阵方法，以更精确地描述复杂形状，并构建旋转不变特征用于分子形状描述、物体识别和形状相似性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA使用协方差矩阵（二阶张量）只能将形状近似为椭球体，但真实形状通常更复杂。需要更高阶的统计矩（如三阶张量）来更精确地描述形状细节，同时保持旋转不变性。

Method: 扩展PCA到高阶张量：使用中心矩（如三阶张量p_abc）或多项式乘以高斯分布的方法，构建可解码的形状描述符。这些高阶张量可以计算旋转不变量（如幂的迹），实现任意精度的形状描述。

Result: 该方法能够创建旋转不变的特征，用于：1）分子形状描述（模旋转）；2）2D图像/3D扫描中的物体识别（模旋转）；3）形状相似性度量，无需昂贵的旋转优化即可比较形状。

Conclusion: 通过高阶张量扩展PCA的形状描述方法，能够更精确地捕捉复杂形状特征，同时保持旋转不变性，为形状分析、物体识别和分子描述提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: PCA can be used for rotation invariant features, describing a shape with its $p_{ab}=E[(x_i-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])]$ covariance matrix approximating shape by ellipsoid, allowing for rotation invariants like its traces of powers. However, real shapes are usually much more complicated, hence there is proposed its extension to e.g. $p_{abc}=E[(x_a-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])(x_c-E[x_c])]$ order-3 or higher tensors describing central moments, or polynomial times Gaussian allowing decodable shape descriptors of arbitrarily high accuracy, and their analogous rotation invariants. Its practical applications could be rotation-invariant features to include shape modulo rotation e.g. for molecular shape descriptors, or for up to rotation object recognition in 2D images/3D scans, or shape similarity metric allowing their inexpensive comparison (modulo rotation) without costly optimization over rotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMErroR是一个多模态基准测试，包含2013个嵌入单一连贯推理错误的样本，用于评估视觉语言模型检测错误推理和分类错误类型的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在多模态学习中的性能提升，需要评估这些模型是否真正理解处理的内容，特别是能否检测推理过程中的错误并识别错误类型。

Method: 构建MMErroR基准测试，包含2013个样本，涵盖6个顶级领域下的24个子领域，每个样本嵌入单一连贯的推理错误。该基准专注于过程级、以错误为中心的评估。

Result: 评估了20个先进视觉语言模型，即使最佳模型（Gemini-3.0-Pro）也只能在66.47%的情况下正确分类错误，表明识别错误推理具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 准确识别错误的能力为理解多模态推理模型的能力提供了宝贵见解，MMErroR基准揭示了当前模型在检测错误推理方面仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have improved performance in multi-modal learning, raising the question of whether these models truly understand the content they process. Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models. Project Page: https://mmerror-benchmark.github.io

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的可重光照3D高斯头部模型，可以从单张或多张图像重建并重光照头像，无需OLAT数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高质量重光照方法需要复杂的时间复用光照数据（如OLAT），限制了应用范围。需要一种能从普通图像重建并重光照头像的通用方法

Method: 采用两阶段设计：第一阶段从无OLAT的多视角数据学习平面光照3DGS头像；第二阶段学习从平面光照头像到物理反射参数的映射，使用小规模OLAT数据集训练

Result: 模型能泛化到新主体，从单张图像即可重建并重光照头像，实现高质量的新视角合成和重光照效果

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段方法成功实现了无需OLAT数据的通用可重光照3D高斯头部模型，显著降低了数据采集要求，扩展了应用场景

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a standard approach to reconstruct and render photorealistic 3D head avatars. A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars.

Conclusion: HairGuard框架能有效恢复3D视觉任务中的软边界细节，通过可插拔的深度修复和生成式场景绘制实现几何一致性和细粒度细节保留。

Abstract: Soft boundaries, like thin hairs, are commonly observed in natural and computer-generated imagery, but they remain challenging for 3D vision due to the ambiguous mixing of foreground and background cues. This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HairGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across monocular depth estimation, stereo image/video conversion, and novel view synthesis, with significant improvements in soft boundary regions.

*Sha Luo,Yogesh Prabhu,Tim Ossowski,Kaiping Chen,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了RiskCueBench视频风险预测基准，要求模型仅基于早期风险信号片段预测风险事件，而非使用完整视频序列，以更好反映现实世界条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频社交媒体的快速发展，从视觉数据中预测风险事件对公共安全和事故预防具有重要意义。现有研究大多让模型访问包含事故本身的完整视频序列，这大大降低了任务难度，无法反映现实世界条件。

Method: 引入新的视频理解基准RiskCueBench，对视频进行精心标注以识别风险信号片段——即指示潜在安全担忧的最早时刻。模型需要基于这些早期视觉信号来预测未来的风险事件。

Result: 实验结果显示，当前系统在解释不断演变的情境和基于早期视觉信号预测未来风险事件方面存在显著差距，突显了视频风险预测模型在实际部署中的重要挑战。

Conclusion: RiskCueBench基准更好地反映了现实世界条件，揭示了当前视频风险预测系统的局限性，为实际部署中的挑战提供了重要见解。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video centered social media, the ability to anticipate risky events from visual data is a promising direction for ensuring public safety and preventing real world accidents. Prior work has extensively studied supervised video risk assessment across domains such as driving, protests, and natural disasters. However, many existing datasets provide models with access to the full video sequence, including the accident itself, which substantially reduces the difficulty of the task. To better reflect real world conditions, we introduce a new video understanding benchmark RiskCueBench in which videos are carefully annotated to identify a risk signal clip, defined as the earliest moment that indicates a potential safety concern. Experimental results reveal a significant gap in current systems ability to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risky events from early visual signals, highlighting important challenges for deploying video risk prediction models in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术发展，深度伪造的合成与滥用成为严重威胁，为维持数字时代的信任，需要有效的深度伪造检测与标记方法

Method: 提出新颖架构，使用空间域与频域特征的交叉注意力机制，结合血液检测模块，采用Swin Transformer/BERT或EfficientNet-B4/BERT组合进行分类

Result: 在FF++数据集上达到99.80% AUC，在Celeb-DF数据集上达到99.88% AUC（使用Swin Transformer和BERT），使用EfficientNet-B4和BERT时分别达到99.55%和99.38% AUC，跨数据集泛化性能优秀

Conclusion: 该统一架构在深度伪造检测方面超越了现有最佳方法，具有良好的泛化能力，为数字信任提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The advancements in the field of AI is increasingly giving rise to various threats. One of the most prominent of them is the synthesis and misuse of Deepfakes. To sustain trust in this digital age, detection and tagging of deepfakes is very necessary. In this paper, a novel architecture for Deepfake detection in images and videos is presented. The architecture uses cross attention between spatial and frequency domain features along with a blood detection module to classify an image as real or fake. This paper aims to develop a unified architecture and provide insights into each step. Though this approach we achieve results better than SOTA, specifically 99.80%, 99.88% AUC on FF++ and Celeb-DF upon using Swin Transformer and BERT and 99.55, 99.38 while using EfficientNet-B4 and BERT. The approach also generalizes very well achieving great cross dataset results as well.

*Matteo Dunnhofer,Christian Micheloni,Kohitij Kar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 比较猴子IT皮层在自然视频中的响应与静态、循环和视频ANN模型，发现视频模型预测能力有限，且无法捕捉IT对运动不变性的编码


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究灵长类视觉系统中IT皮层如何处理动态视觉信息，以及当前ANN模型是否能捕捉其动态计算特性，特别是对运动不变性的编码能力

Method: 通过比较猕猴IT皮层在自然视频中的神经响应与静态、循环和视频ANN模型的预测能力，并使用"外观消除"变体视频进行压力测试

Result: 视频模型在神经预测方面有适度改进，但所有ANN模型都无法捕捉IT对运动不变性的编码能力，IT种群活动能跨外观消除操作泛化

Conclusion: 当前视频模型主要捕捉外观依赖的动态特征，而非IT表达的外观不变性时间计算，需要新的目标函数来编码生物时间统计特性和不变性

Abstract: Feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on static images remain the dominant models of the the primate ventral visual stream, yet they are intrinsically limited to static computations. The primate world is dynamic, and the macaque ventral visual pathways, specifically the inferior temporal (IT) cortex not only supports object recognition but also encodes object motion velocity during naturalistic video viewing. Does IT's temporal responses reflect nothing more than time-unfolded feedforward transformations, framewise features with shallow temporal pooling, or do they embody richer dynamic computations? We tested this by comparing macaque IT responses during naturalistic videos against static, recurrent, and video-based ANN models. Video models provided modest improvements in neural predictivity, particularly at later response stages, raising the question of what kind of dynamics they capture. To probe this, we applied a stress test: decoders trained on naturalistic videos were evaluated on "appearance-free" variants that preserve motion but remove shape and texture. IT population activity generalized across this manipulation, but all ANN classes failed. Thus, current video models better capture appearance-bound dynamics rather than the appearance-invariant temporal computations expressed in IT, underscoring the need for new objectives that encode biological temporal statistics and invariances.

TL;DR: Eye-Q是一个多语言视觉文字谜题基准，旨在评估视觉语言模型的深层推理能力而非表面识别，结果显示当前最先进模型在抽象和跨语言谜题上存在显著性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在标准基准上表现良好，但往往依赖表面识别而非深层推理。需要更具挑战性的任务来评估模型发现隐含视觉线索、生成和修正假设、将感知证据映射到非字面概念的能力。

Method: 提出Eye-Q多语言基准，包含1,343个视觉文字谜题，模型观察概念密集的场景和简短描述，必须推断特定目标词或短语。谜题故意设计为非结构化和线索隐含，包含干扰项和需要选择性注意、抽象和关联推理的上下文关系。基准涵盖英语、波斯语、阿拉伯语和跨语言谜题。

Result: 评估结果显示当前最先进视觉语言模型存在显著性能差距，特别是在抽象和跨语言谜题上。最大准确率仅为60.27%，表明模型在构建和搜索适当概念表示以进行灵活图像到短语推理的能力有限。

Conclusion: 视觉文字谜题是评估视觉语言模型深层推理能力的有效工具，Eye-Q基准揭示了当前模型在复杂视觉理解方面的局限性，特别是在抽象推理和跨语言场景中，为未来模型发展提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on standard vision-language benchmarks, yet often rely on surface-level recognition rather than deeper reasoning. We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.

TL;DR: GAMBIT是一种新颖的多模态越狱框架，通过构建游戏化场景驱动模型主动完成恶意查询，显著提升对推理型MLLMs的攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法主要增加视觉任务复杂度，未能充分利用模型的推理激励机制，导致在推理型模型上效果不佳。如果模型能像人类一样思考，能否通过影响其认知阶段决策来主动完成越狱？

Method: 提出GAMBIT框架：1）分解并重组有害视觉语义；2）构建游戏化场景驱动模型探索、重构意图；3）让模型作为参与者，其目标追求降低安全注意力，诱导回答重构后的恶意查询。

Result: 在流行的推理型和非推理型MLLMs上实验显示，GAMBIT达到高攻击成功率：Gemini 2.5 Flash 92.13%，QvQ-MAX 91.20%，GPT-4o 85.87%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过游戏化场景驱动模型主动推理，GAMBIT有效突破了多模态大语言模型的安全对齐机制，揭示了利用模型自身推理激励机制进行越狱的新途径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become widely deployed, yet their safety alignment remains fragile under adversarial inputs. Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.

Abstract: We present WeedRepFormer, a lightweight multi-task Vision Transformer designed for simultaneous waterhemp segmentation and gender classification. Existing agricultural models often struggle to balance the fine-grained feature extraction required for biological attribute classification with the efficiency needed for real-time deployment. To address this, WeedRepFormer systematically integrates structural reparameterization across the entire architecture - comprising a Vision Transformer backbone, a Lite R-ASPP decoder, and a novel reparameterizable classification head - to decouple training-time capacity from inference-time latency. We also introduce a comprehensive waterhemp dataset containing 10,264 annotated frames from 23 plants. On this benchmark, WeedRepFormer achieves 92.18% mIoU for segmentation and 81.91% accuracy for gender classification using only 3.59M parameters and 3.80 GFLOPs. At 108.95 FPS, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art iFormer-T by 4.40% in classification accuracy while maintaining competitive segmentation performance and significantly reducing parameter count by 1.9x.

TL;DR: FROST-Drive：一种新颖的端到端自动驾驶架构，通过冻结预训练视觉语言模型的视觉编码器权重，直接将其强大的泛化能力迁移到驾驶任务中，在长尾场景下显著优于完全微调的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端自动驾驶模型通常对视觉编码器进行完全微调，这可能导致模型过度专注于训练数据而限制了泛化能力。本文质疑这种训练范式的必要性，旨在探索如何更好地利用预训练视觉语言模型的广泛世界知识来提升自动驾驶系统在复杂、新颖场景中的表现。

Method: 提出FROST-Drive架构：1）冻结预训练视觉语言模型的视觉编码器权重，保留其泛化能力；2）使用基于Transformer的适配器进行多模态融合；3）采用GRU解码器生成平滑的路径点；4）设计专门优化Rater Feedback Score（RFS）的损失函数，该指标优先考虑鲁棒的轨迹规划。

Result: 在Waymo Open E2E数据集（专门包含长尾场景的大规模数据集）上的广泛实验表明，冻结编码器的方法显著优于采用完全微调的模型。结果提供了有力证据，表明保留强大视觉语言模型的广泛知识比密集的领域特定适应更能实现鲁棒、可泛化的驾驶性能。

Conclusion: 保留预训练视觉语言模型的泛化能力是提升端到端自动驾驶系统在复杂现实场景中表现的有效策略。这为开发能够更好处理现实世界应用领域复杂性的视觉模型提供了新途径，挑战了当前完全微调视觉编码器的常见做法。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) models in autonomous driving aim to directly map sensor inputs to control commands, but their ability to generalize to novel and complex scenarios remains a key challenge. The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.

Abstract: Instruction-driven image editing with unified multimodal generative models has advanced rapidly, yet their underlying visual reasoning remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance on reasoning-centric edits. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning. Experiments show our method significantly outperforms prior work on reasoning-centric image editing, producing instruction-faithful, visually coherent, and semantically grounded edits.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard approach for post-training large language models and, more recently, for improving image generation models, which uses reward functions to enhance generation quality and human preference alignment. However, existing reward designs are often imperfect proxies for true human judgment, making models prone to reward hacking--producing unrealistic or low-quality images that nevertheless achieve high reward scores. In this work, we systematically analyze reward hacking behaviors in text-to-image (T2I) RL post-training. We investigate how both aesthetic/human preference rewards and prompt-image consistency rewards individually contribute to reward hacking and further show that ensembling multiple rewards can only partially mitigate this issue. Across diverse reward models, we identify a common failure mode: the generation of artifact-prone images. To address this, we propose a lightweight and adaptive artifact reward model, trained on a small curated dataset of artifact-free and artifact-containing samples. This model can be integrated into existing RL pipelines as an effective regularizer for commonly used reward models. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating our artifact reward significantly improves visual realism and reduces reward hacking across multiple T2I RL setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of lightweight reward augment serving as a safeguard against reward hacking.

Abstract: Referring remote sensing image segmentation aims to localize specific targets described by natural language within complex overhead imagery. However, due to extreme scale variations, dense similar distractors, and intricate boundary structures, the reliability of cross-modal alignment exhibits significant \textbf{spatial non-uniformity}. Existing methods typically employ uniform fusion and refinement strategies across the entire image, which often introduces unnecessary linguistic perturbations in visually clear regions while failing to provide sufficient disambiguation in confused areas. To address this, we propose an \textbf{uncertainty-guided framework} that explicitly leverages a pixel-wise \textbf{referring uncertainty map} as a spatial prior to orchestrate adaptive inference. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play \textbf{Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS)}, which is trained via an online error-consistency supervision strategy to interpretably predict the spatial distribution of referential ambiguity. Building on this prior, we design two plug-and-play modules: 1) \textbf{Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF)}, which dynamically modulates language injection strength to enhance constraints in high-uncertainty regions while suppressing noise in low-uncertainty ones; and 2) \textbf{Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR)}, which utilizes uncertainty-derived soft masks to focus refinement on error-prone boundaries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method functions as a unified, plug-and-play solution that significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without altering the backbone architecture.

Conclusion: 视觉统计偏差是物体幻觉的重要成因，通过结构扰乱对比解码可以有效抑制纹理驱动的偏差，从而减少幻觉并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate significant progress in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet object hallucination remains a critical challenge. While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation on point clouds is critical for 3D scene understanding. However, sparse and irregular point distributions provide limited appearance evidence, making geometry-only features insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances (e.g., color, texture, material). We propose Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation. Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models. Additionally, Gaussian scale attributes enable precise boundary localization in complex 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks and shows significant improvements on geometrically challenging classes, all without any 2D or language supervision.

Conclusion: 将人体视为世界模型状态空间的一部分而非输出，从根本上改变了运动模拟和预测的方式，为人体运动预测提供了新范式

Abstract: Human motion prediction has traditionally been framed as a sequence regression problem where models extrapolate future joint coordinates from observed pose histories. While effective over short horizons this approach does not separate observation reconstruction with dynamics modeling and offers no explicit representation of the latent causes governing motion. As a result, existing methods exhibit compounding drift, mean-pose collapse, and poorly calibrated uncertainty when rolled forward beyond the training regime. Here we propose a Semantic Belief-State World Model (SBWM) that reframes human motion prediction as latent dynamical simulation on the human body manifold. Rather than predicting poses directly, SBWM maintains a recurrent probabilistic belief state whose evolution is learned independently of pose reconstruction and explicitly aligned with the SMPL-X anatomical parameterization. This alignment imposes a structural information bottleneck that prevents the latent state from encoding static geometry or sensor noise, forcing it to capture motion dynamics, intent, and control-relevant structure. Inspired by belief-state world models developed for model-based reinforcement learning, SBWM adapts stochastic latent transitions and rollout-centric training to the domain of human motion. In contrast to RSSM-based, transformer, and diffusion approaches optimized for reconstruction fidelity, SBWM prioritizes stable forward simulation. We demonstrate coherent long-horizon rollouts, and competitive accuracy at substantially lower computational cost. These results suggest that treating the human body as part of the world models state space rather than its output fundamentally changes how motion is simulated, and predicted.

Abstract: Optics-guided thermal UAV image super-resolution has attracted significant research interest due to its potential in all-weather monitoring applications. However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles. Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that PCNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks including semantic segmentation and object detection.

TL;DR: CloudMatch：一种通过视图一致性学习和场景混合增强的半监督云检测框架，有效利用未标记遥感图像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素级标注成本高昂，需要开发有效的半监督学习方法。云模式在不同场景和同一场景类别中表现出结构多样性和上下文变异性。

Method: 提出CloudMatch框架，为每个未标记图像生成一个弱增强视图和两个互补的强增强视图：一个集成跨场景补丁以模拟上下文多样性，另一个采用场景内混合以保持语义连贯性。通过跨多样化增强视图的预测一致性来指导伪标签生成。

Result: 大量实验表明CloudMatch取得了良好性能，证明了其有效利用未标记数据并推进半监督云检测的能力。

Conclusion: CloudMatch通过视图一致性学习和场景混合增强，能够有效捕捉云模式的结构多样性和上下文丰富性，为半监督云检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotating accurate pixel-level labels, semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for cloud detection. In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments show that CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating its capability to utilize unlabeled data efficiently and advance semi-supervised cloud detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EASLT是一个情感感知的手语翻译框架，通过专门的情感编码器和情感感知融合模块，将面部表情作为语义锚点来解决手势歧义问题，在多个基准测试中取得了先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的无注释手语翻译方法主要关注手势信号，但忽视了面部表情的语义重要性。当不同概念具有相同的手势表达时，这会导致语义歧义。面部表情作为情感信号，对于准确理解手语语义至关重要。

Method: 提出了EASLT框架，包含专门的情感编码器来捕捉连续的情感动态，并通过情感感知融合模块自适应地重新校准时空手语特征。该框架将面部情感作为语义锚点，而不是辅助信息。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和CSL-Daily基准测试中，EASLT在无注释方法中取得了先进性能，分别获得26.15和22.80的BLEU-4分数，以及61.0和57.8的BLEURT分数。消融研究证实情感建模有效解耦了情感语义和手势动态。

Conclusion: 明确建模情感可以有效解耦情感语义和手势动态，显著提高翻译保真度。面部表情应被视为语义锚点而非辅助信息，这对于解决手语翻译中的语义歧义至关重要。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a complex cross-modal task requiring the integration of Manual Signals (MS) and Non-Manual Signals (NMS). While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatiaLoc是一个利用粗到精策略的跨模态定位框架，通过实例级和全局级的空间关系建模，在文本和点云之间进行定位，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态定位（文本和点云）使机器人能够通过自然语言描述进行定位，应用于自主导航和人机交互。由于物体在文本和点云中经常重复出现，空间关系成为最具有区分性的定位线索。

Method: 采用粗到精策略：粗阶段使用BEOSE（贝塞尔增强物体空间编码器）通过二次贝塞尔曲线建模实例级空间关系，以及FAE（频率感知编码器）在频域生成全局级空间表示；精阶段使用UGFL（不确定性感知高斯精细定位器）通过高斯分布建模预测并采用不确定性感知损失函数回归2D位置。

Result: 在KITTI360Pose数据集上的大量实验表明，SpatiaLoc显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SpatiaLoc通过强调实例级和全局级的空间关系，在跨模态定位任务中取得了优异性能，证明了空间关系建模的重要性。

Abstract: Cross-modal localization using text and point clouds enables robots to localize themselves via natural language descriptions, with applications in autonomous navigation and interaction between humans and robots. In this task, objects often recur across text and point clouds, making spatial relationships the most discriminative cues for localization. Given this characteristic, we present SpatiaLoc, a framework utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy that emphasizes spatial relationships at both the instance and global levels. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves. Additionally, a Frequency Aware Encoder (FAE) generates spatial representations in the frequency domain at the global level. In the fine stage, an Uncertainty Aware Gaussian Fine Localizer (UGFL) regresses 2D positions by modeling predictions as Gaussian distributions with a loss function aware of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on KITTI360Pose demonstrate that SpatiaLoc significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: 提出基于掩码预训练模型微调（MPFT）策略，通过纹理感知掩码（TAM）机制提升CLIP-ViT检测AI生成图像的能力，在少量数据微调下实现优异的跨模型泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展提高了AI生成图像的质量，引发了关于虚假信息和公众信任的担忧。检测AI生成图像成为关键挑战，特别是在泛化到未见过的生成模型方面。现有方法将CLIP图像编码器作为基本特征提取器，未能充分利用其潜力。

Method: 提出掩码预训练模型微调（MPFT）策略，包含纹理感知掩码（TAM）机制。通过分析发现CLIP-ViT能有效聚类真实图像，但缺乏区分真实与AI生成图像的能力。TAM在微调过程中掩码包含生成模型特定模式的纹理区域，迫使CLIP-ViT关注真实图像的"分布偏差"。

Result: 在GenImage和UniversalFakeDetect数据集上的大量实验表明，仅用少量图像微调的方法显著优于现有方法，在两个数据集上分别达到98.2%和94.6%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的MPFT策略通过纹理感知掩码机制有效提升了CLIP-ViT检测AI生成图像的能力，在少量数据微调下实现了优异的跨模型泛化性能，为AI生成图像检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has significantly enhanced the quality of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation and the erosion of public trust. Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the "distributional deviations"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: SiT-Bench是一个评估纯文本LLM空间智能的新基准，通过将视觉场景转换为坐标感知的文本描述，测试LLM在无像素输入下的空间推理能力，发现LLM存在"空间差距"但具有潜在世界建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前空间智能研究主要依赖视觉语言模型，但一个重要问题尚未解决：空间理解能力究竟来自视觉编码器还是基础推理架构？为了探究LLM在无视觉输入情况下的纯文本空间推理能力，作者开发了SiT-Bench基准。

Method: 将单视图/多视图场景转换为高保真、坐标感知的文本描述，构建包含3,800多个专家标注项目的基准，涵盖5个主要类别和17个子任务（如自我中心导航、视角转换、精细机器人操作）。通过纯文本推理而非视觉模式匹配来评估LLM的空间智能。

Result: 评估最先进的LLM发现：模型在局部语义任务上表现良好，但在全局一致性方面存在显著的"空间差距"。值得注意的是，显式的空间推理能显著提升性能，表明LLM具有潜在的世界建模能力。

Conclusion: SiT-Bench作为基础资源，将促进开发具有空间基础能力的LLM主干，为未来VLM和具身智能体提供支持。研究揭示了LLM的空间推理潜力，并指出了当前模型在全局空间一致性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents. Our code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/binisalegend/SiT-Bench .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本分割研究忽视真实场景中的复杂环境因素（光照、背景、视角等），导致实验室训练的模型在实际部署中表现不佳

Method: 提出自适应注意力蒸馏(AAD)方法，通过反复对比和蒸馏已知（支持）与未知（查询）图像间的关键共享语义，提取新类别的类特定注意力

Result: AAD在所有数据集和设置上提升mIoU 3.3%-8.5%，表现出优越性能和强泛化能力

Conclusion: 提出的环境鲁棒性FSS设置和AAD方法有效增强了模型在真实动态条件下的鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to rapidly learn novel class concepts from limited examples to segment specific targets in unseen images, and has been widely applied in areas such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

Motivation: 石刻铭文图像因蚀刻字符与石头背景对比度差、表面退化不均匀、干扰伪影多、文字密度和布局变化大等问题，导致现有二值化技术难以提取连贯字符区域。

Method: 提出鲁棒自适应分块策略，通过动态采样和分块选择训练注意力U-Net模型，注意力机制关注细微结构线索，分块方法帮助模型克服表面噪声和布局不规则性。

Conclusion: 该方法为石刻铭文生成干净、结构化的内容表示，为下游任务如文字识别、OCR和历史文本分析奠定基础，展示了鲁棒性和文字无关的泛化能力。

Abstract: Binarization is a popular first step towards text extraction in historical artifacts. Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

TL;DR: 比较NeWCRFs和Depth Anything V2在单目伪激光雷达检测中的表现，发现深度主干网络选择比特征增强更重要，语义特征仅带来边际提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D物体检测相比激光雷达成本更低，但精度较差，主要困难在于从单张图像估计度量深度。本研究系统评估深度主干网络和特征工程对伪激光雷达流程的影响。

Method: 在KITTI验证集上，使用相同的伪激光雷达生成和PointRCNN检测协议，比较NeWCRFs（监督度量深度）和Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor。测试了点云增强方法，包括外观线索（灰度强度）和语义线索（实例分割置信度）。

Result: NeWCRFs在中等难度分割上获得10.50% AP3D（IoU=0.7）。语义特征仅带来边际提升，基于掩码的采样可能因移除上下文几何而降低性能。深度主干网络选择和几何保真度主导性能，超过次要特征注入。

Conclusion: 在现成的激光雷达检测器下，深度主干网络选择和几何保真度是性能的关键因素，语义特征增强效果有限。粗粒度深度正确性不能完全预测严格的3D IoU性能。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection offers a low-cost alternative to LiDAR, yet remains less accurate due to the difficulty of estimating metric depth from a single image. We systematically evaluate how depth backbones and feature engineering affect a monocular Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline on the KITTI validation split. Specifically, we compare NeWCRFs (supervised metric depth) against Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor (Base) under an identical pseudo-LiDAR generation and PointRCNN detection protocol. NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence). Contrary to the expectation that semantics would substantially close the gap, these features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance by removing contextual geometry. Finally, we report a depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes (including Ped/Cyc), highlighting that coarse depth correctness does not fully predict strict 3D IoU. Overall, under an off-the-shelf LiDAR detector, depth-backbone choice and geometric fidelity dominate performance, outweighing secondary feature injection.

Motivation: 现有基于描述性特征的物体分类技术依赖物体对齐来计算相似性，这限制了方法的适用性和效率

Method: 将物体边界归一化并分割为近似凸段，按长度降序排序，提取段长度、极值点数量、面积、基部和宽度等特征包来测量边界相似性

Result: 在多个数据集上测试获得了可接受的结果

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过特征排序替代了物体对齐的需求，为物体分类提供了一种有效的替代方案

Abstract: The existing object classification techniques based on descriptive features rely on object alignment to compute the similarity of objects for classification. This paper replaces the necessity of object alignment through sorting of feature. The object boundary is normalized and segmented into approximately convex segments and the segments are then sorted in descending order of their length. The segment length, number of extreme points in segments, area of segments, the base and the width of the segments - a bag of features - is used to measure the similarity between image boundaries. The proposed method is tested on datasets and acceptable results are observed.

Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution precipitation nowcasting from radar echo sequences is crucial for disaster mitigation and economic planning, yet it remains a significant challenge. Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting.

Conclusion: CrackSegFlow能有效生成高质量裂缝图像-掩码对，显著提升裂缝分割性能，并发布了包含5万对数据的CSF-50K公开数据集用于大规模基准测试

Abstract: Automated crack segmentation is essential for scalable condition assessment of pavements and civil infrastructure, yet practical deployment is limited by scarce pixel-level labels and severe domain shift across sensors, illumination, textures, and annotation conventions. This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry. Finally, we release CSF-50K, a public dataset of 50,000 paired crack images and pixel-accurate masks for large-scale benchmarking of generalizable crack segmentation.

Conclusion: VideoMemory通过动态记忆库机制有效解决了叙事视频生成中的实体一致性问题，支持连贯的长格式生成。

Abstract: Maintaining consistent characters, props, and environments across multiple shots is a central challenge in narrative video generation. Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios. Extensive experiments show that VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover complete 3D geometry from partial observations caused by limited viewpoints and occlusions. Existing learning-based works, including 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, point-based, and Transformer-based methods, have achieved strong performance on synthetic benchmarks. However, due to the limitations of modality, scalability, and generative capacity, their generalization to novel objects and real-world scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGPC, a generalizable multimodal point cloud completion framework that integrates point clouds, RGB images, and text within a unified architecture. MGPC introduces an innovative modality dropout strategy, a Transformer-based fusion module, and a novel progressive generator to improve robustness, scalability, and geometric modeling capability. We further develop an automatic data generation pipeline and construct MGPC-1M, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000 categories and one million training pairs. Extensive experiments on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.

Result: 证明了联合训练范式的技术可行性：扩散潜变量包含足够信息恢复V-JEPA 2物理表示，多任务优化在训练过程中保持稳定

Conclusion: 该工作建立了物理感知生成模型未来大规模评估的基础，展示了在视频生成中嵌入物理先验的技术可行性

Abstract: Current video generation models produce high-quality aesthetic videos but often struggle to learn representations of real-world physics dynamics, resulting in artifacts such as unnatural object collisions, inconsistent gravity, and temporal flickering. In this work, we propose PhysVideoGenerator, a proof-of-concept framework that explicitly embeds a learnable physics prior into the video generation process. We introduce a lightweight predictor network, PredictorP, which regresses high-level physical features extracted from a pre-trained Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA 2) directly from noisy diffusion latents. These predicted physics tokens are injected into the temporal attention layers of a DiT-based generator (Latte) via a dedicated cross-attention mechanism. Our primary contribution is demonstrating the technical feasibility of this joint training paradigm: we show that diffusion latents contain sufficient information to recover V-JEPA 2 physical representations, and that multi-task optimization remains stable over training. This report documents the architectural design, technical challenges, and validation of training stability, establishing a foundation for future large-scale evaluation of physics-aware generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用2D点轨迹作为额外运动线索的自我中心动作识别新方法，通过随机采样图像点并跟踪其轨迹，结合Transformer模型显著提升了识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我中心动作识别方法主要依赖RGB外观、人体姿态估计或其组合，缺乏有效的运动信息表示。本文旨在探索2D点轨迹作为一种轻量级但有效的运动线索，以提升动作识别性能。

Method: 使用CoTracker在视频中跟踪一组随机初始化的图像点，将得到的轨迹与对应图像帧一起作为输入，送入基于Transformer的识别模型。创新之处在于不检测手、物体或交互区域，仅依赖点轨迹运动信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，整合2D点轨迹相比不使用运动信息的相同模型能持续提升性能。令人惊讶的是，即使仅提供初始帧及其关联的点轨迹（不包含完整视频序列），也能获得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 2D点轨迹是一种轻量级但有效的自我中心动作理解表示方法，能够显著提高动作识别准确率，为自我中心视觉分析提供了新的运动信息利用途径。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for egocentric action recognition that leverages 2D point tracks as an additional motion cue. While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding.

Motivation: 解决VLMs在6-DoF内窥镜相机定位中的三大挑战：缺乏大规模高质量医学定位数据集、细粒度姿态回归能力有限、时序特征提取计算延迟高。利用VLMs的通用语义理解与配准方法的精确几何对齐的互补优势。

Method: 1) 构建BREATH数据集，目前最大的体内内窥镜定位数据集；2) 提出BREATH-VL混合框架，集成VLMs语义线索与视觉配准几何信息；3) 引入轻量级上下文学习机制，将运动历史编码为语言提示，实现高效时序推理。

Result: 视觉语言模块在挑战性手术场景中实现鲁棒语义定位。BREATH-VL在精度和泛化性上优于最先进的视觉定位方法，平移误差相比最佳基线降低25.5%，同时保持有竞争力的计算延迟。

Conclusion: BREATH-VL框架成功整合了VLMs的语义理解能力和视觉配准的几何精度，为复杂医学环境中的内窥镜定位提供了有效解决方案，在精度、泛化性和计算效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in navigation and localization tasks by leveraging large-scale pretraining for semantic understanding. However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.

Motivation: 主动对准是大规模自动化组装高精度光学系统的关键技术。基于光学模拟的数字孪生管道能生成大规模标注数据，但复杂成像条件导致模拟与真实图像间存在域差距，限制了模拟训练模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出域自适应主动对准（DA3）方法：1）使用自回归域变换生成器；2）采用基于对抗的特征对齐策略；3）通过自监督学习提取真实域信息；4）提取域不变图像退化特征以实现鲁棒的对准预测。

Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.

TL;DR: CSMCIR提出统一表示框架解决组合图像检索中的表示空间碎片化问题，通过多级思维链提示、对称双塔架构和动态记忆库实现高效查询-目标对齐，在多个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组合图像检索方法存在表示空间碎片化问题：查询和目标包含异构模态，由不同编码器处理，迫使模型仅通过事后对齐来桥接错位的表示空间，这从根本上限制了检索性能。这种架构不对称性导致特征空间中形成三个分离的簇，直接展示了异构模态如何从初始化就创建根本错位的表示空间。

Method: 1) 多级思维链提示策略：引导多模态大语言模型为目标图像生成具有区分性、语义兼容的标题，建立模态对称性；2) 对称双塔架构：查询和目标两侧使用相同的共享参数Q-Former进行跨模态编码，确保一致的特征表示；3) 基于熵的时序动态记忆库策略：提供高质量负样本，同时保持与演化模型状态的一致性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CSMCIR实现了最先进的性能，并具有优越的训练效率。全面的消融研究进一步验证了每个提出组件的有效性。

Conclusion: CSMCIR通过统一表示框架解决了组合图像检索中的表示空间碎片化问题，通过模态对称性、架构对称性和动态负采样策略实现了高效的查询-目标对齐，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables users to search for target images using both a reference image and manipulation text, offering substantial advantages over single-modality retrieval systems. However, existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation: queries and targets comprise heterogeneous modalities and are processed by distinct encoders, forcing models to bridge misaligned representation spaces only through post-hoc alignment, which fundamentally limits retrieval performance. This architectural asymmetry manifests as three distinct, well-separated clusters in the feature space, directly demonstrating how heterogeneous modalities create fundamentally misaligned representation spaces from initialization. In this work, we propose CSMCIR, a unified representation framework that achieves efficient query-target alignment through three synergistic components. First, we introduce a Multi-level Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting strategy that guides Multimodal Large Language Models to generate discriminative, semantically compatible captions for target images, establishing modal symmetry. Building upon this, we design a symmetric dual-tower architecture where both query and target sides utilize the identical shared-parameter Q-Former for cross-modal encoding, ensuring consistent feature representations and further reducing the alignment gap. Finally, this architectural symmetry enables an entropy-based, temporally dynamic Memory Bank strategy that provides high-quality negative samples while maintaining consistency with the evolving model state. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CSMCIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior training efficiency. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification of marine animals supports ecology, biodiversity and habitat conservation, and evidence-based policy-making. However, existing methods often overlook contextual interactions from the surrounding environment and insufficiently incorporate the hierarchical structure of marine biological taxonomy. To address these challenges, we propose MATANet (Multi-context Attention and Taxonomy-Aware Network), a novel model designed for fine-grained marine species classification. MATANet mimics expert strategies by using taxonomy and environmental context to interpret ambiguous features of underwater animals. It consists of two key components: a Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM), which learns relationships between regions of interest (ROIs) and their surrounding environments, and a Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLM), which encodes taxonomic hierarchy into the feature space. MATANet combines instance and environmental features with taxonomic structure to enhance fine-grained classification. Experiments on the FathomNet2025, FAIR1M, and LifeCLEF2015-Fish datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Understanding how two radiology image sets differ is critical for generating clinical insights and for interpreting medical AI systems. We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features. Together, RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data.

Conclusion: HyperCOD数据集和HSC-SAM基线为该新兴领域提供了坚实基础，将推动高光谱伪装目标检测的未来研究。

Abstract: RGB-based camouflaged object detection struggles in real-world scenarios where color and texture cues are ambiguous. While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets. The HyperCOD dataset and our HSC-SAM baseline provide a robust foundation to foster future research in this emerging area.

Conclusion: I2E通过结构化分解和物理感知的动作规划，为复杂图像编辑任务提供了更精确、更可控的解决方案，代表了图像编辑范式的重要转变。

Abstract: Existing text-guided image editing methods primarily rely on end-to-end pixel-level inpainting paradigm. Despite its success in simple scenarios, this paradigm still significantly struggles with compositional editing tasks that require precise local control and complex multi-object spatial reasoning. This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel "Decompose-then-Action" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing. Experimental results on I2E-Bench and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.

Conclusion: MVP作为VideoLLMs的新型后训练目标，有效弥补了现有方法在时间连贯性和因果理解方面的不足，为视频语言模型提供了更强大的时序推理能力

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training paradigms for Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved significant success by optimizing for visual-semantic tasks such as captioning or VideoQA. However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.

Abstract: In the manufacturing industry, computer vision systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) are widely used to reduce costs and increase production. Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets. We measure their relative performance when used to train an AI object detection model to separate stones and potatoes in a bin picking environment. We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models. Finetuning on a small real dataset can significantly improve the performance of the models and even get similar performance when less representative models are used.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable performance in code synthesis; however, data-aware augmentation remains a limiting factor, handled via heuristic design or brute-force approaches. We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.

Abstract: Developing foundation models in medical imaging requires continuous monitoring of downstream performance. Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies. All experiments and results are tracked centrally and are reproducible with a single command, while efficient caching and parallel execution enable scalable use on shared compute infrastructure. Demonstrated on five state-of-the-art foundation models and three medical imaging classification tasks, EvalBlocks streamlines model evaluation, enabling researchers to iterate faster and focus on model innovation rather than evaluation logistics. The framework is released as open source software at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/eval-blocks.

TL;DR: IDESplat通过迭代深度概率提升机制改进3D高斯泼溅的均值预测，实现高质量场景重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一warp操作估计深度概率，无法充分利用跨视角几何线索，导致深度图不稳定且粗糙，影响高斯均值预测精度

Method: 提出迭代深度概率提升单元(DPBU)，通过级联warp操作生成极线注意力图进行乘法融合，堆叠多个DPBU迭代优化深度候选，逐步精炼深度图

Result: 在RealEstate10K、ACID和DL3DV数据集上取得SOTA性能，PSNR比DepthSplat提升0.33dB，参数量仅需10.7%，内存减少30%；跨数据集实验中在DTU上PSNR提升2.95dB

Conclusion: IDESplat通过迭代深度概率提升机制显著改进高斯均值预测，实现高质量、高效率的3D场景重建，并展现出强大的泛化能力

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: MDENeRF：一种迭代框架，通过NeRF深度信息优化单目深度估计，结合单目全局结构和NeRF高频细节，提升深度图质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单目深度估计方法生成的深度图通常过于平滑，缺乏精确场景理解所需的精细几何细节，限制了在自动驾驶导航和扩展现实等领域的应用效果

Method: 提出MDENeRF三组件框架：1) 初始单目估计提供全局结构；2) 在扰动视点上训练的NeRF，具有逐像素不确定性；3) 贝叶斯融合单目和NeRF深度。通过体渲染过程推导NeRF不确定性，迭代注入高频细节

Result: 在SUN RGB-D室内场景数据集上，在关键指标和实验中表现出优越性能

Conclusion: MDENeRF通过结合单目深度估计的全局结构和NeRF的精细几何细节，有效提升了深度图质量，为场景理解提供了更准确的深度信息

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has applications in many fields, such as autonomous navigation and extended reality, making it an essential computer vision task. However, current methods often produce smooth depth maps that lack the fine geometric detail needed for accurate scene understanding. We propose MDENeRF, an iterative framework that refines monocular depth estimates using depth information from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). MDENeRF consists of three components: (1) an initial monocular estimate for global structure, (2) a NeRF trained on perturbed viewpoints, with per-pixel uncertainty, and (3) Bayesian fusion of the noisy monocular and NeRF depths. We derive NeRF uncertainty from the volume rendering process to iteratively inject high-frequency fine details. Meanwhile, our monocular prior maintains global structure. We demonstrate superior performance on key metrics and experiments using indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset.

Abstract: Distributing government relief efforts after a flood is challenging. In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management. Traditional manual surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite-based methods face challenges like cloud cover and low spatial resolution. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical "Full Damage" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery. This work presented a cost-effective and scalable solution, paving the way for a nationwide shift from manual to automated, high-fidelity damage assessment.

### [58] [FocusUI: Efficient UI Grounding via Position-Preserving Visual Token Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03928)
*Mingyu Ouyang,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusUI：一个高效的UI grounding框架，通过选择与指令最相关的视觉补丁并保持位置连续性，显著减少视觉token数量，提升推理速度和降低内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在UI grounding任务中处理高分辨率截图时会产生大量视觉token（如2K分辨率约4700个），导致计算开销大且注意力稀释。而人类与UI交互时通常只关注感兴趣区域，因此需要更高效的UI grounding方法。

Method: 提出FocusUI框架，解决两个关键挑战：1）通过融合指令条件分数和基于规则的UI图分数来构建补丁级监督，消除冗余视觉token；2）引入PosPad策略，将连续丢弃的视觉token序列压缩为单个特殊标记并放置在序列末尾索引，以保持位置连续性。

Result: 在四个grounding基准测试中，FocusUI超越了GUI-specific基线。在ScreenSpot-Pro基准上，FocusUI-7B比GUI-Actor-7B性能提升3.7%。即使只保留30%视觉token，性能仅下降3.2%，同时实现1.44倍推理加速和17%峰值GPU内存降低。

Conclusion: FocusUI通过智能选择相关视觉补丁并保持位置连续性，为UI grounding任务提供了高效解决方案，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.

Motivation: 现有1D视觉分词器遵循语言建模设计原则，将视觉数据视为扁平序列，忽略了视觉的层次性和残差网络设计这一关键特性，导致表示能力受限。

Method: 提出ResTok，构建图像token和潜在token的层次残差表示，通过渐进合并实现跨层次特征融合，同时保持语义残差避免信息重叠。进一步引入层次AR生成器，通过一次预测整个层级的潜在token来加速生成过程。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上仅用9步采样达到gFID 2.34，显著优于现有方法。层次残差先验的恢复显著提升了AR图像生成性能，同时实现了更集中的潜在分布和跨层次绑定。

Conclusion: 将视觉的层次残差先验重新引入视觉分词器设计，能够显著提升自回归图像生成的效果和效率，证明了视觉特定先验在视觉tokenization中的重要性。

Abstract: Existing 1D visual tokenizers for autoregressive (AR) generation largely follow the design principles of language modeling, as they are built directly upon transformers whose priors originate in language, yielding single-hierarchy latent tokens and treating visual data as flat sequential token streams. However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring "vision" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps.

Conclusion: FUSION通过联合建模身体和手部运动，实现了精确的手部运动控制同时保持合理的全身协调性，为全身运动合成提供了新的解决方案，代码将公开。

Abstract: Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination. The code will be public.

Abstract: Commercial-grade poster design demands the seamless integration of aesthetic appeal with precise, informative content delivery. Current automated poster generation systems face significant limitations, including incomplete design workflows, poor text rendering accuracy, and insufficient flexibility for commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models. To the best of our knowledge, PosterDNA is the first Chinese poster generation dataset to introduce HTML typography files, enabling scalable text rendering and fundamentally solving the challenges of rendering small and high-density text. Experimental results demonstrate that PosterVerse consistently produces commercial-grade posters with appealing visuals, accurate text alignment, and customizable layouts, making it a promising solution for automating commercial poster design.

Conclusion: Padé神经元提供了一种更强大的非线性神经元模型，具有非线性多样性和层效率优势，能有效提升神经网络性能，且兼容现有架构。代码已开源

Abstract: Neural networks commonly employ the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, which is a linear model followed by a point-wise non-linear activation. Various researchers have already advanced inherently non-linear neuron models, such as quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, which offer stronger non-linearity compared to point-wise activation functions. In this paper, we introduce a novel and better non-linear neuron model called Padé neurons (Paons), inspired by Padé approximants. Paons offer several advantages, such as diversity of non-linearity, since each Paon learns a different non-linear function of its inputs, and layer efficiency, since Paons provide stronger non-linearity in much fewer layers compared to piecewise linear approximation. Furthermore, Paons include all previously proposed neuron models as special cases, thus any neuron model in any network can be replaced by Paons. We note that there has been a proposal to employ the Padé approximation as a generalized point-wise activation function, which is fundamentally different from our model. To validate the efficacy of Paons, in our experiments, we replace classic neurons in some well-known neural image super-resolution, compression, and classification models based on the ResNet architecture with Paons. Our comprehensive experimental results and analyses demonstrate that neural models built by Paons provide better or equal performance than their classic counterparts with a smaller number of layers. The PyTorch implementation code for Paon is open-sourced at https://github.com/onur-keles/Paon.

Conclusion: REACT填补了生成视频结构失真评估的空白，通过专门的帧级奖励模型和两阶段训练策略，为视频生成质量提供了更全面的评估维度。

Abstract: Recent advances in video reward models and post-training strategies have improved text-to-video (T2V) generation. While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.

Abstract: Reliable operation of wind turbines requires frequent inspections, as even minor surface damages can degrade aerodynamic performance, reduce energy output, and accelerate blade wear. Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong cross-site generalization by consistently segmenting turbine blades across distinct windfarms.

Conclusion: LocalDPO为视频生成器对齐建立了更高效、细粒度的范式，通过局部偏好学习和自动化数据收集解决了现有方法的效率和质量问题

Abstract: Aligning text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences is crucial for generating high-quality videos. Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.

Motivation: 大型多模态模型在视频推理中展现出强大能力，但其推理链的鲁棒性存在问题。研究发现模型存在"文本惯性"现象，即出现文本幻觉后会盲目坚持错误文本，忽视冲突的视觉证据，这影响了推理的可靠性。

Method: 提出LogicGraph扰动协议，在多种LMM的推理链中结构化注入扰动来评估其自反思能力；然后提出Active Visual-Context Refinement方法，这是一种训练无关的推理范式，包含主动视觉重定位机制和自适应上下文精炼策略。

Result: 实验显示模型在不到10%的情况下能成功自我纠正，主要表现出盲目的文本错误传播。提出的方法能显著抑制幻觉传播，增强推理鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型存在严重的文本惯性问题，提出的训练无关推理范式能有效缓解幻觉传播，提升推理的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将强大的基础重建模型先验与视频扩散模型相结合，实现场景级3D生成，同时提高重建的鲁棒性。

Method: 重新利用VGGT重建模型生成几何潜在表示，通过训练适配器使其与预训练视频扩散模型的外观潜在表示对齐，联合生成解耦但对齐的潜在表示。

Result: 在单图像和多图像条件下的3D场景生成中达到最先进水平，能同时生成RGB视频、相机姿态、深度图和全局点云。

Conclusion: 通过紧密耦合重建模型和生成模型，实现了场景级3D生成，展示了两种模型相互增强的协同效应。

Abstract: We present Gen3R, a method that bridges the strong priors of foundational reconstruction models and video diffusion models for scene-level 3D generation. We repurpose the VGGT reconstruction model to produce geometric latents by training an adapter on its tokens, which are regularized to align with the appearance latents of pre-trained video diffusion models. By jointly generating these disentangled yet aligned latents, Gen3R produces both RGB videos and corresponding 3D geometry, including camera poses, depth maps, and global point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in single- and multi-image conditioned 3D scene generation. Additionally, our method can enhance the robustness of reconstruction by leveraging generative priors, demonstrating the mutual benefit of tightly coupling reconstruction and generative models.

TL;DR: GeoReason框架通过两阶段训练策略解决遥感视觉语言模型中的逻辑幻觉问题，提升空间推理的认知可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前遥感视觉语言模型在复杂空间任务中存在逻辑幻觉问题，即正确结论来自错误推理链或依赖位置捷径而非空间逻辑，这削弱了战略空间决策的可靠性。

Method: 1) 构建GeoReason-Bench逻辑驱动数据集（4000个推理轨迹）；2) 两阶段训练：监督知识初始化（学习推理语法和领域知识）和一致性感知强化学习（引入逻辑一致性奖励，通过选项排列策略惩罚逻辑漂移）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架显著提升了遥感视觉语言模型的认知可靠性和可解释性，相比其他先进方法取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GeoReason框架通过同步内部思维与最终决策，有效解决了遥感视觉语言模型中的逻辑幻觉问题，为复杂空间推理任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The evolution of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models(RS-VLMs) emphasizes the importance of transitioning from perception-centric recognition toward high-level deductive reasoning to enhance cognitive reliability in complex spatial tasks. However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the cognitive reliability and interpretability of RS-VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other advanced methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星持续生成海量数据，特别是卫星图像时间序列(SITS)，但现有深度学习模型主要处理完整图像或时间序列，缺乏对像素级时间变化的有效编码方法。

Method: 1) 将像素级植被指数时间序列(NDVI、EVI、SAVI)转换为递归图作为2D表示；2) 提出PIMC多模态自监督方法，结合2D像素时间序列表示和遥感影像进行对比学习；3) 在PASTIS数据集上进行像素级预测和分类，在EuroSAT数据集上进行土地覆盖分类。

Result: 实验表明：1) 2D表示显著增强了SITS的特征提取能力；2) 对比学习提高了像素时间序列和遥感影像的表征质量；3) 在多个下游任务中超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该多模态方法为处理卫星图像时间序列和遥感影像提供了一个强大的自监督框架，在各种地球观测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Satellites continuously generate massive volumes of data, particularly for Earth observation, including satellite image time series (SITS). However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Diffusion-DRF方法，使用冻结的视觉语言模型作为训练免费批评器，通过可微分奖励流微调视频扩散模型，避免传统偏好优化方法的标签依赖和奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于DPO的文本到视频生成方法依赖不可微分的偏好信号（人工标注或学习型奖励模型），导致训练标签密集、易产生偏见、容易被欺骗，常引发奖励黑客和不稳定训练。

Method: 使用冻结的现成视觉语言模型作为训练免费批评器，通过可微分奖励流将VLM反馈直接反向传播到扩散去噪链中，将logit级响应转换为token感知梯度进行优化。采用自动化、方面结构化的提示管道获取可靠的多维度VLM反馈，并通过梯度检查点实现高效更新。

Result: Diffusion-DRF提高了视频质量和语义对齐，同时缓解了奖励黑客和崩溃问题，无需额外的奖励模型或偏好数据集。该方法具有模型无关性，可轻松推广到其他基于扩散的生成任务。

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRF为视频扩散模型提供了一种高效、稳定、无需训练奖励模型的微调方法，解决了传统偏好优化方法的局限性，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently improved Text-to-Video (T2V) generation by enhancing visual fidelity and text alignment. However, current methods rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models. This reliance makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and easy-to-game, which often triggers reward hacking and unstable training. We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps. Diffusion-DRF improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse -- without additional reward models or preference datasets. It is model-agnostic and readily generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ToTMNet，一种轻量级rPPG架构，用FFT加速的Toeplitz时间混合层替代时间注意力机制，实现高效长程时间滤波，仅63k参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度rPPG模型虽然提高了鲁棒性，但计算成本和参数量增加，时间注意力机制存在二次方时间复杂度的扩展问题，需要更高效的架构。

Method: 提出ToTMNet架构，使用FFT加速的Toeplitz时间混合层替代注意力机制。Toeplitz算子通过循环嵌入和FFT卷积实现近线性时间计算，结合局部深度时间卷积分支和门控全局Toeplitz混合，形成紧凑的门控时间混合器。

Result: 在UBFC-rPPG数据集上达到1.055 bpm MAE和0.996 Pearson相关系数；在合成到真实场景（SCAMPS到UBFC-rPPG）达到1.582 bpm MAE和0.994相关系数。参数量仅63k。

Conclusion: Toeplitz结构时间混合是rPPG中注意力机制的高效实用替代方案，门控机制对有效利用全局Toeplitz混合（特别是在域转移下）很重要。主要局限是仅使用两个数据集。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimates a blood volume pulse (BVP) waveform from facial videos captured by commodity cameras. Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法存在两难：2D图像方法易于构建维护但几何推理能力有限；3D结构方法精度高但需要集中式重建且难以更新。需要一种既能保持易用性又能实现高精度的解决方案。

Method: 采用2D图像表示，但为每张图像添加估计的深度图来捕获几何结构。利用密集匹配器，结合紧凑压缩和GPU加速的LO-RANSAC实现，在存储和计算上均高效。

Result: 在多个标准基准测试中达到新的最先进精度，在可比地图大小下优于现有的内存高效方法。

Conclusion: 通过增强2D图像表示与深度信息，实现了既易于构建维护又具有高精度的视觉定位方法，在精度和内存效率之间提供了灵活权衡。

Abstract: Existing visual localization methods are typically either 2D image-based, which are easy to build and maintain but limited in effective geometric reasoning, or 3D structure-based, which achieve high accuracy but require a centralized reconstruction and are difficult to update. In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.

TL;DR: CHORD是一个通用的生成式流水线，用于合成动态物体和场景的4D（3D+时间）运动，通过从2D视频中提取拉格朗日运动信息来实现类别无关的动态生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的图形流水线创建动态场景需要类别特定的启发式方法，劳动密集且不可扩展；而基于学习的方法通常需要大规模数据集，可能无法覆盖所有感兴趣的物体类别。需要一种通用、类别无关的方法来生成多样的4D场景动态。

Method: 提出基于蒸馏的流水线，从2D视频的欧拉表示中提取隐藏的拉格朗日运动信息，继承视频生成模型的通用性，实现通用、多功能、类别无关的动态生成。

Result: 实验表明该方法能生成多样的多体4D动态，相比现有方法具有优势，并展示了在生成机器人操作策略方面的应用潜力。

Conclusion: CHORD提供了一种通用、类别无关的方法来合成4D场景动态，解决了传统方法的可扩展性问题，并为机器人操作等应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Dynamic objects in our physical 4D (3D + time) world are constantly evolving, deforming, and interacting with other objects, leading to diverse 4D scene dynamics. In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

TL;DR: 提出一个集成框架，通过自动化训练测验、实时注意力评分和高效成对比较，提升主观视频质量评估的数据质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主观视频质量评估方法存在局限性：难以捕捉细微的感知差异，且无法保证用户输入的可靠性。需要一种能提升评分者训练效果、强化注意力监控、并减少比较次数的改进方法。

Method: 提出三步集成框架：1) 自动化训练测验，让参与者学习视频质量关键指标并验证准备情况；2) 实时注意力评分机制，使用"黄金"视频对监控评分者注意力，对注意力不集中施加惩罚；3) 高效的链式成对比较程序，以JOD单位生成质量分数。

Result: 实验比较三组（无训练、有训练无反馈、有训练有反馈）共80名参与者，结果显示：训练测验显著提高了黄金单元准确率并降低了平局率；实时反馈进一步提升了数据质量，产生了最单调的质量评分。该方法能显著减少高质量区域R-Q曲线的非单调情况。

Conclusion: 该集成框架通过训练测验和实时反馈机制，能有效提升主观视频质量评估的数据质量和可靠性，减少所需比较次数，并有助于训练更好的客观视频质量指标。

Abstract: Subjective video quality assessment is crucial for optimizing streaming and compression, yet traditional protocols face limitations in capturing nuanced perceptual differences and ensuring reliable user input. We propose an integrated framework that enhances rater training, enforces attention through real-time scoring, and streamlines pairwise comparisons to recover quality scores with fewer comparisons. Participants first undergo an automated training quiz to learn key video quality indicators (e.g., compression artifacts) and verify their readiness. During the test, a real-time attention scoring mechanism, using "golden" video pairs, monitors and reinforces rater focus by applying penalties for lapses. An efficient chain-based pairwise comparison procedure is then employed, yielding quality scores in Just-Objectionable-Differences (JOD) units. Experiments comparing three groups (no training, training without feedback, and training with feedback) with 80 participants demonstrate that training-quiz significantly improves data quality in terms of golden unit accuracy and reduces tie rate, while real-time feedback further improves data quality and yields the most monotonic quality ratings. The new training, quiz, testing with feedback, 3-phase approach can significantly reduce the non-monotonic cases on the high quality part of the R-Q curve where normal viewer typically prefer the slightly compressed less-grainy content and help train a better objective video quality metric.

Abstract: The deployment of transformer-based models on resource-constrained edge devices represents a critical challenge in enabling real-time artificial intelligence applications. This comprehensive survey examines lightweight transformer architectures specifically designed for edge deployment, analyzing recent advances in model compression, quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation techniques. We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms. We establish real-time performance boundaries and provide a practical 6-step deployment pipeline achieving 8-12x size reduction with less than 2% accuracy degradation.

Method: 使用六个LLM代理组成的流水线，每个代理对应科学研究工作流程的不同阶段（如问题提出、方法设计、实验实施、论文撰写等），进行了四次端到端的自主生成ML研究论文的尝试。

Result: 四次尝试中，三次在实施或评估阶段失败，一次成功完成整个流水线并被Agents4Science 2025会议接受（该会议要求AI系统作为第一作者）。研究识别了六个常见失败模式：偏向训练数据默认值、执行压力下的实施漂移、长周期任务中的记忆和上下文退化、过度兴奋（尽管明显失败仍宣布成功）、领域智能不足、实验设计中的科学品味薄弱。

Abstract: We report a case study of four end-to-end attempts to autonomously generate ML research papers using a pipeline of six LLM agents mapped to stages of the scientific workflow. Of these four, three attempts failed during implementation or evaluation. One completed the pipeline and was accepted to Agents4Science 2025, an experimental inaugural venue that required AI systems as first authors, passing both human and multi-AI review. From these attempts, we document six recurring failure modes: bias toward training data defaults, implementation drift under execution pressure, memory and context degradation across long-horizon tasks, overexcitement that declares success despite obvious failures, insufficient domain intelligence, and weak scientific taste in experimental design.

TL;DR: R²VPO：通过约束策略比率的方差而非硬截断，提升RL微调LLM的稳定性和数据效率，在数学推理任务上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于PPO和GRPO的on-policy RL在微调LLM时使用硬截断策略比率，这虽然稳定训练但存在两个问题：1）会截断高回报但高差异动作的梯度，抑制复杂推理中的"顿悟时刻"；2）数据一旦过时就无法使用，导致严重的样本效率低下。

Method: 提出R²VPO（Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization），一个基于原始-对偶框架的新方法。核心思想是显式约束策略比率的方差（二阶中心矩），作为硬截断的平滑松弛。这种方法既稳定策略更新，又保留有价值轨迹的梯度信号，同时支持通过动态重新加权而非丢弃的方式重用过时样本。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B和openPangu-Embedded系列（1B和7B）等先进LLM上进行广泛评估，在数学推理基准测试中，R²VPO相比基于截断的基线方法平均相对提升达17%，收敛所需rollout数量减少约50%。

Conclusion: 策略比率方差控制是提高RL-based LLM对齐中稳定性和数据效率的有前景方向，R²VPO框架在保持训练稳定的同时显著提升了样本效率和最终性能。

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has become the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative "eureka moments" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence. These findings establish ratio-variance control as a promising direction for improving both stability and data efficiency in RL-based LLM alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for radiology report generation, yet their clinical translation is hindered by architectural heterogeneity and the prevalence of factual hallucinations. Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel "Reason-then-Summarize" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines.

TL;DR: 提出HEEGNet混合双曲网络架构，利用双曲几何捕捉EEG的层次结构，通过粗到细域适应策略学习域不变表示，在多个EEG数据集上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG解码常因跨域分布偏移（如不同受试者）导致泛化性能差。EEG数据具有层次结构（如视觉处理层次），而双曲空间作为树结构的连续模拟，能自然表示层次数据，但现有方法多依赖欧几里得嵌入。

Method: HEEGNet混合双曲网络架构：结合欧几里得和双曲编码器，采用新颖的粗到细域适应策略。首先实证证明EEG数据具有双曲性，然后设计网络捕捉EEG层次结构并学习域不变双曲嵌入。

Result: 在多个公开EEG数据集（视觉诱发电位、情绪识别、颅内EEG）上的广泛实验表明，HEEGNet实现了最先进的性能，双曲嵌入改善了泛化能力。

Conclusion: EEG数据具有双曲性，利用双曲几何能有效捕捉其层次结构并学习域不变表示。HEEGNet通过混合架构和域适应策略显著提升EEG解码的泛化性能，为脑机接口应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces facilitate direct communication with a computer, enabling promising applications in human-computer interactions. However, their utility is currently limited because EEG decoding often suffers from poor generalization due to distribution shifts across domains (e.g., subjects). Learning robust representations that capture underlying task-relevant information would mitigate these shifts and improve generalization. One promising approach is to exploit the underlying hierarchical structure in EEG, as recent studies suggest that hierarchical cognitive processes, such as visual processing, can be encoded in EEG. While many decoding methods still rely on Euclidean embeddings, recent work has begun exploring hyperbolic geometry for EEG. Hyperbolic spaces, regarded as the continuous analogue of tree structures, provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical data. In this study, we first empirically demonstrate that EEG data exhibit hyperbolicity and show that hyperbolic embeddings improve generalization. Motivated by these findings, we propose HEEGNet, a hybrid hyperbolic network architecture to capture the hierarchical structure in EEG and learn domain-invariant hyperbolic embeddings. To this end, HEEGNet combines both Euclidean and hyperbolic encoders and employs a novel coarse-to-fine domain adaptation strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple public EEG datasets, covering visual evoked potentials, emotion recognition, and intracranial EEG, demonstrate that HEEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个用于法国野火严重程度预测的序数分类框架，比较了不同损失函数对预测罕见高严重度火灾的影响，发现序数监督显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野火在空间和严重程度上高度不平衡，预测极端事件特别困难。需要开发与法国运营决策直接对齐的野火严重程度预测框架，并研究损失函数设计对预测罕见但关键的高严重度火灾的影响。

Method: 引入首个用于预测野火严重程度的序数分类框架，比较标准交叉熵与多种序数感知目标函数，包括提出的基于截断离散指数广义帕累托分布的概率TDeGPD损失。在多种架构和真实运营数据上进行广泛基准测试。

Result: 序数监督显著优于传统方法，加权Kappa损失（WKLoss）获得最佳整体结果，在最极端严重度类别上IoU增益超过+0.1，同时保持有竞争力的校准质量。但由于数据集中罕见事件的极低代表性，对最罕见事件的预测性能仍然有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了将严重程度排序、数据不平衡考虑和季节性风险整合到野火预测系统中的重要性。未来工作将专注于将季节动态和不确定性信息纳入训练，以进一步提高极端事件预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Wildfires are highly imbalanced natural hazards in both space and severity, making the prediction of extreme events particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems. Future work will focus on incorporating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty information into training to further improve the reliability of extreme-event prediction.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms represent a fundamental paradigm shift in neural network architectures, enabling models to selectively focus on relevant portions of input sequences through learned weighting functions. This monograph provides a comprehensive and rigorous mathematical treatment of attention mechanisms, encompassing their theoretical foundations, computational properties, and practical implementations in contemporary deep learning systems. Applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning demonstrate the versatility of attention mechanisms. We examine language modeling with autoregressive transformers, bidirectional encoders for representation learning, sequence-to-sequence translation, Vision Transformers for image classification, and cross-modal attention for vision-language tasks. Empirical analysis reveals training characteristics, scaling laws that relate performance to model size and computation, attention pattern visualizations, and performance benchmarks across standard datasets. We discuss the interpretability of learned attention patterns and their relationship to linguistic and visual structures. The monograph concludes with a critical examination of current limitations, including computational scalability, data efficiency, systematic generalization, and interpretability challenges.

*Oleksandr Kuznetsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LUT-KAN：通过分段查找表编译和量化方法，将KAN网络中的样条函数转换为量化查找表，显著提升CPU推理速度（10-12倍），同时保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN网络使用可学习样条函数替代标量权重，虽然准确且可解释，但在CPU上推理成本高（需要大量样条计算），且标准量化工具链难以应用（主要计算不是矩阵乘法而是样条基函数评估）。

Method: 提出LUT-KAN方法：将每条边的函数转换为分段查找表（LUT），采用int8/uint8仿射量化和线性插值。建立明确的推理契约（边界约定和越界策略），并提出"诚实基线"评估方法，在相同后端优化下比较B样条和LUT评估。

Result: 在DoS攻击检测案例中，编译后的模型保持分类质量（F1下降小于0.0002），CPU推理延迟降低12倍（NumPy）和10倍（Numba），内存开销约10倍（L=64时）。实验包括LUT分辨率（16-128）和两种量化方案的全面评估。

Conclusion: LUT-KAN为KAN网络提供了高效的量化推理方案，显著提升CPU性能同时保持精度，建立了可复现的推理契约和评估基准，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KAN) replace scalar weights by learnable univariate functions, often implemented with B-splines. This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8). We report accuracy, speed, and memory metrics with mean and standard deviation across multiple seeds. A two-by-two OOB robustness matrix evaluates behavior under different boundary modes and OOB policies. In a case study, we compile a trained KAN model for DoS attack detection (CICIDS2017 pipeline) into LUT artifacts. The compiled model preserves classification quality (F1 drop below 0.0002) while reducing steady-state CPU inference latency by 12x under NumPy and 10x under Numba backends (honest baseline). The memory overhead is approximately 10x at L=64. All code and artifacts are publicly available with fixed release tags for reproducibility.

Motivation: 广泛使用的KCC等混凝土本构模型依赖经验校准的失效面，缺乏模型形式的灵活性和不确定性量化能力，需要改进。

Method: 保留KCC模型的模块化弹塑性结构，用约束高斯过程回归替代经验失效面，通过三轴压缩实验数据训练，并加入导数约束确保物理一致性。

Result: 物理信息GPR在训练条件附近和更高围压水平下都表现出更好的精度和可靠性，预测方差减小，置信区间更紧，泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的框架提供了鲁棒、不确定性感知的替代模型，在不牺牲KCC模型可解释性和数值效率的前提下，改进了泛化能力并简化了校准过程。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling the constitutive behavior of concrete is crucial for civil and defense applications, yet widely used phenomenological models such as Karagozian \& Case concrete (KCC) model depend on empirically calibrated failure surfaces that lack flexibility in model form and associated uncertainty quantification. This work develops a physics-informed framework that retains the modular elastoplastic structure of KCC model while replacing its empirical failure surface with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate that can be learned directly from experimentally accessible observables. Triaxial compression data under varying confinement levels are used for training, and the surrogate is then evaluated at confinement levels not included in the training set to assess its generalization capability. Results show that an unconstrained GPR interpolates well near training conditions but deteriorates and violates essential physical constraints under extrapolation, even when augmented with simulated data. In contrast, a physics-informed GPR that incorporates derivative-based constraints aligned with known material behavior yields markedly better accuracy and reliability, including at higher confinement levels beyond the training range. Probabilistic enforcement of these constraints also reduces predictive variance, producing tighter confidence intervals in data-scarce regimes. Overall, the proposed approach delivers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that improves generalization and streamlines calibration without sacrificing the interpretability and numerical efficiency of the KCC model, offering a practical path toward an improved constitutive models for concrete.

Conclusion: 投影量子核能有效解决机器学习中的数据稀缺问题，为量子辅助神经网络开辟新方向，在数据受限环境中增强CNN分类能力

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in efficiency and accuracy in image classification. However, their efficacy often relies on large, labeled datasets, posing challenges for applications with limited data availability. Our research addresses these challenges by introducing an innovative approach that leverages projected quantum kernels (PQK) to enhance feature extraction for CNNs, specifically tailored for small datasets. Projected quantum kernels, derived from quantum computing principles, offer a promising avenue for capturing complex patterns and intricate data structures that traditional CNNs might miss. By incorporating these kernels into the feature extraction process, we improved the representational ability of CNNs. Our experiments demonstrated that, with 1000 training samples, the PQK-enhanced CNN achieved 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset and 90% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, significantly outperforming the classical CNN, which achieved only 60% and 12% accuracy on the respective datasets. This research reveals the potential of quantum computing in overcoming data scarcity issues in machine learning and paves the way for future exploration of quantum-assisted neural networks, suggesting that projected quantum kernels can serve as a powerful approach for enhancing CNN-based classification in data-constrained environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate route prediction in Drone-as-a-Service operations through weather-aware deep learning models. While classical path-planning algorithms, such as A* and Dijkstra, provide optimal solutions, their computational complexity limits real-time applicability in dynamic environments. We address this limitation by training machine learning and deep learning models on synthetic datasets generated from classical algorithm simulations. Our approach incorporates transformer-based and attention-based architectures that utilize weather heuristics to predict optimal next-node selections while accounting for meteorological conditions affecting drone operations. The attention mechanisms dynamically weight environmental factors including wind patterns, wind bearing, and temperature to enhance routing decisions under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup over traditional algorithms while maintaining route optimization performance, with transformer-based architectures showing superior adaptation to dynamic environmental constraints. The proposed framework enables real-time, weather-responsive route optimization for large-scale DaaS operations, representing a substantial advancement in the efficiency and safety of autonomous drone systems.

Motivation: 合成数据训练LLM导致模型崩溃问题日益严重，但缺乏在高维空间中量化预测崩溃的严格方法

Method: 引入SIGMA框架，通过Gram矩阵谱分析，推导确定性和随机性谱边界来追踪表示空间的收缩

Result: SIGMA能有效捕捉向退化状态的转变，其随机性公式可实现可扩展的边界估计，适用于大规模基础模型

Conclusion: SIGMA为模型崩溃机制提供理论洞见，并为递归训练管道的健康监控提供实用可扩展工具

Abstract: The rapid adoption of synthetic data for training Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced the technical challenge of "model collapse"-a degenerative process where recursive training on model-generated content leads to a contraction of distributional variance and representational quality. While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines.

TL;DR: PanSubNet是一个可解释的深度学习框架，直接从常规H&E染色全切片图像预测胰腺导管腺癌的分子亚型，解决了现有分子分型方法成本高、耗时长的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）的分子分型（基底样和经典亚型）具有重要的预后和预测价值，但现有基于RNA-seq的方法成本高、耗时长、组织要求严格，限制了临床实践中的应用。

Method: 开发了PanSubNet深度学习框架，采用双尺度架构融合细胞级形态和组织级结构，利用注意力机制进行多尺度表示学习和透明特征归因。使用1,055名患者的配对组织学和RNA-seq数据，基于Moffitt 50基因签名和GATA6表达生成真实标签。

Result: 内部验证（五折交叉验证）平均AUC达88.5%，外部验证（TCGA队列）AUC达84.0%，无需微调。模型预测与转录组程序、分化标志物和DNA损伤修复特征一致，在转移性疾病中增强了预后分层能力。

Conclusion: PanSubNet能够从常规H&E染色切片实现快速、经济有效的分子分层，为PDAC提供了临床可部署且可解释的遗传分型工具，支持整合到数字病理工作流程中，推进胰腺癌精准肿瘤学。

Abstract: Molecular subtyping of PDAC into basal-like and classical has established prognostic and predictive value. However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping. We are gathering data from two institutions to validate and assess real-world performance, supporting integration into digital pathology workflows and advancing precision oncology for PDAC.

Result: 该方法实现了高收敛性，收敛速度接近VariAntNet（神经网络框架），在某些场景中是唯一实用的替代方案。相比Bellaiche和Bruckstein的解析解（收敛慢）和VariAntNet（收敛快但成功率中等），该方法在收敛性和速度之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 基于图像的强化学习方法为多智能体分散控制提供了有效解决方案，能够处理空间关系，在保持群体凝聚力的聚合任务中表现出色，为传统方法的局限性提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: This study highlights the potential of image-based reinforcement learning methods for addressing swarm-related tasks. In multi-agent reinforcement learning, effective policy learning depends on how agents sense, interpret, and process inputs. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted feature extraction or raw vector-based representations, which limit the scalability and efficiency of learned policies concerning input order and size. In this work we propose an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized control of a multi-agent system, where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs that can be processed by Neural Networks, extracting its spatial features and producing novel decentralized motion control rules. We evaluate our approach on a multi-agent convergence task of agents with limited-range and bearing-only sensing that aim to keep the swarm cohesive during the aggregation. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against two benchmarks: an analytical solution proposed by Bellaiche and Bruckstein, which ensures convergence but progresses slowly, and VariAntNet, a neural network-based framework that converges much faster but shows medium success rates in hard constellations. Our method achieves high convergence, with a pace nearly matching that of VariAntNet. In some scenarios, it serves as the only practical alternative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全评估存在局限性，现有自动化攻击方法依赖手工先验或白盒梯度传播，导致对模型鲁棒性的高估。需要开发不依赖这些限制的攻击方法以更准确评估模型安全性。

Method: 提出RAILS框架，仅使用模型logits进行token级迭代优化。核心创新包括：1）自回归损失函数确保精确前缀匹配；2）基于历史的选择策略，弥合代理优化目标与真实攻击成功率之间的差距；3）消除梯度依赖，支持跨分词器集成攻击。

Result: 在多个开源模型上实现接近100%的攻击成功率，对GPT和Gemini等闭源系统具有高黑盒攻击迁移性。跨分词器集成攻击能发现共享对抗模式，显著提升对闭源系统的可迁移性。

Conclusion: RAILS框架挑战了现有对抗攻击的约束假设，证明无需梯度或先验知识也能实现高效攻击。该方法为LLM安全评估提供了更准确的基准，并展示了跨模型可迁移对抗模式的发现潜力。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, rigorously evaluating their robustness against adversarial jailbreaks is essential. However, current safety evaluations often overestimate robustness because existing automated attacks are limited by restrictive assumptions. They typically rely on handcrafted priors or require white-box access for gradient propagation. We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种基于注意力图谱的训练无关机制探针，通过计算代数连通性、平滑度和谱熵等指标，揭示模型内部处理机制，发现了特定课程转换导致的连接性崩溃现象（PTCC）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为基准测试只能告诉我们模型做什么，但不能揭示其内部工作机制。需要一种训练无关的方法来探测模型的内在处理机制，理解模型如何实现其功能。

Method: 使用注意力图谱作为机制探针，将每个注意力层视为令牌图，计算代数连通性（λ₂）、平滑度和谱熵等谱特征，形成"谱指纹"来表征模型内部处理策略。

Result: 发现了被动触发连接性崩溃（PTCC）现象：特定课程转换（如代码到聊天）导致英语中非规范结构的连接性显著下降（Δλ₂≈-0.76）。识别出四种重复处理策略，并能完美进行谱系鉴定。PTCC定位到第2层的稀疏"补偿补丁"头，激活引导可部分恢复连接性。

Conclusion: 注意力图谱提供了一种实用的审计和训练制度验证工具。拓扑主导机制更多受分词密度而非语言身份影响，表明"健康"几何结构在不同脚本间存在系统性变化。

Abstract: Behavioral benchmarks tell us \textit{what} a model does, but not \textit{how}. We introduce a training-free mechanistic probe using attention-graph spectra. Treating each layer as a token graph, we compute algebraic connectivity ($λ_2$), smoothness, and spectral entropy. Across 12 models and 10 languages, these measures yield stable ``spectral fingerprints'' that expose discontinuities missed by standard evaluation.
  We report four results. (1) Models undergoing specific curriculum transitions (e.g., code-to-chat) show an English-only, syntax-triggered connectivity failure on non-canonical constructions, reaching $Δλ_2 \approx -0.76$. We term this scar \textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\approx 38\%$ of lost information flow.
  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts. Overall, attention-graph spectra provide a practical tool for auditing and training-regime verification.

In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.

*Zibo Liu,Muyang Li,Zhe Jiang,Shigang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VNU-Bench是首个针对新闻领域多源跨视频理解的基准测试，包含429个新闻组、1,405个视频和2,501个高质量问题，旨在评估模型在多源新闻理解方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注单源、视频内推理，而现实世界的新闻消费本质上是多源的——同一事件由不同媒体以互补细节、不同叙事选择和有时相互矛盾的主张进行报道。稳健的新闻理解需要模型能够比较不同来源的观点，对齐跨来源的多模态证据，并综合多源信息。

Method: 设计了新的问题类型来测试模型从多个角度理解多源多模态新闻的能力。采用了一种新颖的混合人机QA生成流程，解决了构建跨源新闻理解大规模数据集时的可扩展性和质量控制问题。

Result: 构建了包含429个新闻组、1,405个视频和2,501个高质量问题的数据集。对闭源和开源多模态模型的全面评估表明，VNU-Bench对当前MLLMs构成了重大挑战。

Conclusion: VNU-Bench填补了多源跨视频理解基准测试的空白，为评估模型在真实世界新闻理解场景中的能力提供了重要工具，揭示了当前MLLMs在多源新闻理解方面的局限性。

Abstract: News videos are carefully edited multimodal narratives that combine narration, visuals, and external quotations into coherent storylines. In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding. The dataset comprises 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 high-quality questions. Comprehensive evaluation of both closed- and open-source multimodal models shows that VNU-Bench poses substantial challenges for current MLLMs.

Motivation: 用户自定义文本分类在实际应用中很常见（如企业分析、内容审核、领域特定信息检索），但现有方法难以处理用户指定的、先前未见过的类别，需要能够泛化到任意领域新主题集的解决方案。

Method: 提出软上下文编码器架构，将每个候选标签与标签集和输入查询的静态软提示表示进行上下文化。在多样多源数据集上训练，使模型能够有效泛化到从任意领域抽取的完全未见过的主题集的零样本分类。

Conclusion: 提出的软上下文编码器架构能够有效解决用户自定义文本分类问题，在零样本设置下对新主题集表现出强大的泛化能力，在实际应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: User-Defined Text Classification (UDTC) considers the challenge of classifying input text to user-specified, previously unseen classes, a setting that arises frequently in real-world applications such as enterprise analytics, content moderation, and domain-specific information retrieval. We propose a soft-contextualized encoder architecture for UDTC which contextualizes each candidate label with the label set and a static soft prompt representation of the input query. Training on diverse, multi-source datasets enables the model to generalize effectively to zero-shot classification over entirely unseen topic sets drawn from arbitrary domains. We evaluate the proposed architecture both on held-out in-distribution test data and on multiple unseen UDTC benchmarks. Across datasets, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming or matching the baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于EM的DAG感知框架，用于在因果DAG已知但目标变量系统缺失的域迁移场景中，通过结合源域和目标域数据进行目标变量插补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在域迁移场景中，当目标变量在部署域中系统缺失时，如何利用源域完全观测的因果DAG结构来有效插补目标变量的问题。传统方法难以处理因果结构下的域迁移和缺失数据。

Method: 提出统一的EM框架，结合源域和目标域数据通过DAG结构传递信息。引入一阶（梯度）EM更新，用单个投影梯度步替代昂贵的广义最小二乘M步。利用已知因果DAG冻结源域不变机制，仅重新估计受迁移影响的那些条件分布。

Result: 在标准局部强凹性和平滑性假设下，证明一阶EM算子围绕真实目标参数具有局部收缩性，产生几何收敛性，并在协变量迁移和局部机制迁移下获得参数误差和目标插补误差的有限样本保证。在合成七节点SEM、64节点MAGIC-IRRI遗传网络和Sachs蛋白质信号数据上的实验表明，该方法相比基于源域的贝叶斯网络和Kiiveri式EM基线，显著提高了目标插补准确性，在显著域迁移下增益最大。

Conclusion: 提出的DAG感知一阶EM算法能够有效处理因果结构下的域迁移和缺失数据问题，通过利用因果DAG结构实现信息传递和计算效率提升，在多种实际场景中表现出优越的插补性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of imputing a designated target variable that is systematically missing in a shifted deployment domain, when a Gaussian causal DAG is available from a fully observed source domain. We propose a unified EM-based framework that combines source and target data through the DAG structure to transfer information from observed variables to the missing target. On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models. In experiments on a synthetic seven-node SEM, the 64-node MAGIC-IRRI genetic network, and the Sachs protein-signaling data, the proposed DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm improves target imputation accuracy over a fit-on-source Bayesian network and a Kiiveri-style EM baseline, with the largest gains under pronounced domain shift.

Abstract: Progressive driver behavior analytics is crucial for improving road safety and mitigating the issues caused by aggressive or inattentive driving. Previous studies have employed machine learning and deep learning techniques, which often result in low feature optimization, thereby compromising both high performance and interpretability. To fill these voids, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to driver behavior analysis that uses a 12,857-row and 18-column data set taken from Kaggle. After applying preprocessing techniques such as label encoding, random oversampling, and standard scaling, 13 machine learning algorithms were tested. The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%. After deploying the LIME technique in XAI, the top 10 features with the most significant positive and negative influence on accuracy were identified, and the same algorithms were retrained. The accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier decreased slightly to 94.2%, confirming that the efficiency of the model can be improved without sacrificing performance. This hybrid model can provide a return on investment in terms of the predictive power and explainability of the driver behavior process.

Abstract: Deploying models, especially large language models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly attractive to a broader user base, including those without specialized expertise. However, due to the resource constraints of certain hardware, maintaining high accuracy with larger model while meeting the hardware requirements remains a significant challenge. Model quantization technique helps mitigate memory and compute bottlenecks, yet the added complexities of tuning and deploying quantized models further exacerbates these challenges, making the process unfriendly to most of the users. We introduce the Hardware-Aware Quantization Agent (HAQA), an automated framework that leverages LLMs to streamline the entire quantization and deployment process by enabling efficient hyperparameter tuning and hardware configuration, thereby simultaneously improving deployment quality and ease of use for a broad range of users. Our results demonstrate up to a 2.3x speedup in inference, along with increased throughput and improved accuracy compared to unoptimized models on Llama. Additionally, HAQA is designed to implement adaptive quantization strategies across diverse hardware platforms, as it automatically finds optimal settings even when they appear counterintuitive, thereby reducing extensive manual effort and demonstrating superior adaptability. Code will be released.

TL;DR: VeRPO提出了一种用于代码生成的强化学习框架，通过基于单元测试执行统计动态估计难度权重，从加权部分成功构建密集奖励，仅依赖可验证的执行反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码生成RL中的奖励设计面临挑战：主流通过/失败结果奖励通过执行单元测试强制执行功能正确性，但稀疏性限制了性能提升；而外部奖励模型又存在奖励不对齐和计算成本高的问题。

Method: VeRPO通过动态估计每个单元测试的难度权重（基于训练期间的执行统计），从通过的单元测试权重之和推导出密集奖励。为了强化部分成功与端到端功能正确性之间的一致性，进一步将密集信号与全局执行结果整合，建立仅依赖可验证执行反馈的稳健密集奖励范式。

Result: 在多样化基准和设置上的广泛实验表明，VeRPO始终优于结果驱动和基于奖励模型的基线方法，在pass@1指标上实现高达+8.83%的提升，时间成本可忽略不计（<0.02%）且零GPU内存开销。

Conclusion: VeRPO成功解决了代码生成RL中的奖励稀疏性问题，通过完全基于可验证执行反馈构建稳健密集奖励，在保持高效计算的同时显著提升性能。

Abstract: Effective reward design is a central challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for code generation. Mainstream pass/fail outcome rewards enforce functional correctness via executing unit tests, but the resulting sparsity limits potential performance gains. While recent work has explored external Reward Models (RM) to generate richer, continuous rewards, the learned RMs suffer from reward misalignment and prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{VeRPO} (\textbf{V}erifiable D\textbf{e}nse \textbf{R}eward \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a novel RL framework for code generation that synthesizes \textit{robust and dense rewards fully grounded in verifiable execution feedback}. The core idea of VeRPO is constructing dense rewards from weighted partial success: by dynamically estimating the difficulty weight of each unit test based on the execution statistics during training, a dense reward is derived from the sum of weights of the passed unit tests. To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (< 0.02\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.

Abstract: Spherical deep learning has been widely applied to a broad range of real-world problems. Existing approaches often face challenges in balancing strong spherical geometric inductive biases with the need to model real-world heterogeneity. To solve this while retaining spherical geometry, we first introduce a designable Green's function framework (DGF) to provide new spherical operator solution strategy: Design systematic Green's functions under rotational group. Based on DGF, to model biological heterogeneity, we propose Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) fusing 3 operator solutions: (1) Equivariant Solution derived from Equivariant Green's Function for symmetry-consistent modeling; (2) Invariant Solution derived from Invariant Green's Function to eliminate nuisance heterogeneity, e.g., consistent background field; (3) Anisotropic Solution derived from Anisotropic Green's Function to model anisotropic systems, especially fibers with preferred direction. Therefore, the resulting model, GSNO can adapt to real-world heterogeneous systems with nuisance variability and anisotropy while retaining spectral efficiency. Evaluations on spherical MNIST, Shallow Water Equation, diffusion MRI fiber prediction, cortical parcellation and molecule structure modeling demonstrate the superiority of GSNO.

Abstract: Chronic diseases such as diabetes pose significant management challenges, particularly due to the risk of complications like hypoglycemia, which require timely detection and intervention. Continuous health monitoring through wearable sensors offers a promising solution for early prediction of glycemic events. However, effective use of multisensor data is hindered by issues such as signal noise and frequent missing values. This study examines the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the temporal characteristics of key features relevant to hypoglycemia prediction. A comprehensive analysis of imputation techniques is conducted, focusing on those employed in state-of-the-art studies. Furthermore, imputation methods derived from machine learning and deep learning applications in other healthcare contexts are evaluated for their potential to address longer gaps in time-series data. Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of investigating the temporal dynamics of individual features and the implementation of multiple, feature-specific imputation techniques to effectively address heterogeneous temporal patterns inherent in the data.

Abstract: Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) has shown strong potential for identifying anomalies and outliers in high-dimensional data across a wide range of real-world applications, including landslide failure detection in granular media. Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores. (3) Temporal modeling: we introduce a temporal variant, tLID, that learns long-term dynamics from time series data, providing a robust temporal representation of displacement behavior. Finally, we integrate both components into a unified framework, referred to as spatiotemporal LID (stLID), to identify samples that are anomalous in either or both dimensions. Extensive experiments show that stLID consistently outperforms existing methods in failure detection precision and lead-time.

Motivation: 当前MoE模型的核心机制（Top-k路由和辅助负载平衡）缺乏统一的理论基础，需要建立理论框架来理解这些启发式实践的最优性，并为MoE设计提供理论支持。

Method: 构建统一理论框架，从贝叶斯视角（稀疏后验近似和先验正则化）和信息论视角（最小化路由模糊性和最大化信道容量）推导MoE机制。将路由问题形式化为NP-hard稀疏子集选择问题，分析相干性障碍，并提出正交性正则化作为解决方案。

Result: 证明了当专家表示具有高互相干性时，贪婪路由策略无法恢复最优专家子集（相干性障碍）。形式化验证了在专家特征空间施加几何正交性可以缩小NP-hard全局最优解与多项式时间贪婪近似之间的差距。

Conclusion: 正交性正则化是大规模模型的最优工程松弛方案，为MoE的深入理解和创新设计提供了必要的理论支持和技术保证。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models enable large language models to scale efficiently, as they only activate a subset of experts for each input. Their core mechanisms, Top-k routing and auxiliary load balancing, remain heuristic, however, lacking a cohesive theoretical underpinning to support them. To this end, we build the first unified theoretical framework that rigorously derives these practices as optimal sparse posterior approximation and prior regularization from a Bayesian perspective, while simultaneously framing them as mechanisms to minimize routing ambiguity and maximize channel capacity from an information-theoretic perspective. We also pinpoint the inherent combinatorial hardness of routing, defining it as the NP-hard sparse subset selection problem. We rigorously prove the existence of a "Coherence Barrier"; when expert representations exhibit high mutual coherence, greedy routing strategies theoretically fail to recover the optimal expert subset. Importantly, we formally verify that imposing geometric orthogonality in the expert feature space is sufficient to narrow the divide between the NP-hard global optimum and polynomial-time greedy approximation. Our comparative analyses confirm orthogonality regularization as the optimal engineering relaxation for large-scale models. Our work offers essential theoretical support and technical assurance for a deeper understanding and novel designs of MoE.

Conclusion: 本地梯度动态是稳定异构联邦学习的关键调节杠杆，ECGR方法能有效平衡梯度分量提升稳定性

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, yet its stability is fundamentally challenged by statistical heterogeneity in realistic deployments. Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.

Motivation: 现有越狱检测方法主要依赖训练数据中的越狱模板，难以应对现实世界中不断涌现的新型攻击。需要解决更具挑战性的零样本越狱检测问题，即在训练阶段没有越狱模板可用的情况下进行检测。

Method: 提出逐层、逐模块、逐token的特征放大框架：1）识别安全相关层；2）定位编码零样本判别信号的特定模块；3）定位信息丰富的安全token。基于这些发现构建ALERT检测器，在放大后的表示上引入两个独立但互补的分类器。

Conclusion: ALERT通过放大内部特征差异实现了高效有效的零样本越狱检测，能够应对现实世界中不断演化的新型攻击，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Despite rich safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which compromise safety guardrails and pose serious security risks. Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.

Conclusion: 这项工作通过揭示不同建模方法如何随时间解释手机传感行为数据，为下一代自适应、以人为本的心理健康技术奠定了基础，能够推动研究和现实世界福祉的发展。

Abstract: Smartphone sensing offers an unobtrusive and scalable way to track daily behaviors linked to mental health, capturing changes in sleep, mobility, and phone use that often precede symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression. While most prior studies focus on detection that responds to existing conditions, forecasting mental health enables proactive support through Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling. Our results show that DL models, particularly Transformer (Macro-F1 = 0.58), achieve the best overall performance, while LLMs show strength in contextual reasoning but weaker temporal modeling. Personalization substantially improves forecasts of severe mental health states. By revealing how different modeling approaches interpret phone sensing behavioral data over time, this work lays the groundwork for next-generation, adaptive, and human-centered mental health technologies that can advance both research and real-world well-being.

TL;DR: 论文提出将Levin树搜索算法整合到Tree-of-Thoughts框架中，利用语言模型的概率作为启发式指导，在有限计算预算下提高问题解决性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Tree-of-Thoughts方法中的搜索算法往往忽视语言模型推理的高计算成本，特别是在计算资源受限的场景下。需要一种在有限计算预算下提高语言模型问题解决性能的方法。

Method: 将Levin树搜索算法适配到Tree-of-Thoughts框架中，利用语言模型分配的概率作为启发式信息指导树探索，减少思考评估次数。扩展了LTS的理论结果，证明在ToT（剪枝树）中LTS能保证状态扩展次数的上界。

Result: 在固定语言模型查询预算下，LTS在三个领域（Blocksworld、PrOntoQA、Array Sorting）和四种不同语言模型上，始终达到与基线搜索算法相当或更高的准确率。

Conclusion: LTS在ToT框架中表现出高效性，特别适合延迟敏感和资源受限的应用，实现了成本效益和时间效率的问题解决。

Abstract: Recent studies explored integrating state-space search algorithms with Language Models (LM) to perform look-ahead on the token generation process, the ''Tree-of-Thoughts'' (ToT), generated by LMs, thereby improving performance on problem-solving tasks. However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.

Focusing on Beethoven's piano sonatas as a case study, we empirically verify the independence of pitch and hand attributes using normalized mutual information (NMI=0.167) and propose the Smart Embedding architecture, achieving a 48.30% reduction in parameters.

This dual theoretical and applied framework bridges gaps in AI music generation, offering verifiable insights for mathematically grounded deep learning.

Abstract: Digital twins and other simulators are increasingly used to support routing decisions in large-scale networks. However, simulator outputs often exhibit systematic bias, while ground-truth measurements are costly and scarce. We study a stochastic shortest-path problem in which a planner has access to abundant synthetic samples, limited real-world observations, and an edge-similarity structure capturing expected behavioral similarity across links. We model the simulator-to-reality discrepancy as an unknown, edge-specific bias that varies smoothly over the similarity graph, and estimate it using Laplacian-regularized least squares. This approach yields calibrated edge cost estimates even in data-scarce regimes. We establish finite-sample error bounds, translate estimation error into path-level suboptimality guarantees, and propose a computable, data-driven certificate that verifies near-optimality of a candidate route. For cold-start settings without initial real data, we develop a bias-aware active learning algorithm that leverages the simulator and adaptively selects edges to measure until a prescribed accuracy is met. Numerical experiments on multiple road networks and traffic graphs further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Abstract: Artificial neural network operators (ANNOs) have been widely used for approximating deterministic input-output functions; however, their extension to random dynamics remains comparatively unexplored. In this paper, we construct a new class of \textbf{Kantorovich-type Stochastic Neural Network Operators (K-SNNOs)} in which randomness is incorporated not at the coefficient level, but through \textbf{stochastic neurons} driven by stochastic integrators. This framework enables the operator to inherit the probabilistic structure of the underlying process, making it suitable for modeling and approximating stochastic signals. We establish mean-square convergence of K-SNNOs to the target stochastic process and derive quantitative error estimates expressing the rate of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity. Numerical simulations further validate the theoretical results by demonstrating accurate reconstruction of sample paths and rapid decay of the mean square error (MSE). Graphical results, including sample-wise approximations and empirical MSE behaviour, illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed stochastic-neuron-based operator.

TL;DR: ReLA：基于结构化表示学习与聚合的强化学习调度器，通过多尺度架构学习作业和机器的多样化表示，显著提升调度质量和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有作业调度解决方案在运行时间和调度质量方面存在局限，特别是在问题规模增大时表现不佳。需要一种能够高效处理大规模调度问题并保证调度质量的解决方案

Method: 提出ReLA强化学习调度器，采用结构化表示学习和聚合方法：1）使用自注意力机制和卷积的两个实体内学习模块学习作业操作和机器的表示；2）使用交叉注意力的实体间学习模块；3）多尺度架构应用这些模块并聚合输出以支持强化学习决策

Result: 在小型、中型和大型作业实例实验中，ReLA在大多数测试设置中达到最佳完工时间。在非大型实例上，将SOTA基线的优化差距降低13.0%；在大型实例上降低78.6%，平均优化差距分别降至7.3%和2.1%

Conclusion: ReLA学习的表示和聚合为强化学习调度提供了强大的决策支持，能够实现快速作业完成和决策制定，适用于实际应用场景

Abstract: Job scheduling is widely used in real-world manufacturing systems to assign ordered job operations to machines under various constraints. Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively. These results confirm that ReLA's learned representations and aggregation provide strong decision support for RL scheduling, and enable fast job completion and decision-making for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 该研究提出两种信息论度量来量化神经元对单个概念的显著性和选择性，在TabPFN表格基础模型中发现部分神经元对高级概念表现出中等但统计显著的响应特性，表明可解释神经元可以自然涌现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型虽然强大但决策过程往往不透明。神经科学和人工智能领域持续关注是否存在类似"祖母细胞"的神经元——即对单一概念有排他性响应的、具有内在可解释性的神经元。本研究旨在探索基础模型中是否存在这样的可解释神经元。

Method: 提出两种信息论度量：神经元显著性和神经元选择性，用于量化神经元对单个概念的响应特性。将这些度量应用于TabPFN（一个表格基础模型）的表征，并通过简单的神经元-概念对搜索来寻找最显著和最具选择性的配对。

Result: 分析首次提供了证据，表明在此类模型中，部分神经元对高级概念表现出中等但统计显著的显著性和选择性。这些神经元可以在不依赖更复杂可解释性技术的情况下被识别。

Conclusion: 研究发现可解释神经元可以在基础模型中自然涌现，并且有时可以通过相对简单的方法被识别。这为理解基础模型的内部工作机制提供了新视角，并可能简化模型可解释性分析的过程。

Abstract: Foundation models are powerful yet often opaque in their decision-making. A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques.

Motivation: 解决固定容量卷积神经网络在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，避免现有方法需要动态扩展网络或记忆过去任务数据带来的参数和计算开销。

Method: 提出GESCL方法，包含两个关键组件：1）稳定性正则化项防止对过去任务重要的滤波器在学习新任务时偏离过大；2）可塑性正则化项利用CNN的过参数化特性稀疏化网络，调整不重要滤波器使其适应未来任务。

Result: 在流行的持续学习视觉基准测试中，GESCL在整体持续学习性能（分类准确率）和避免灾难性遗忘方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: GESCL通过结合稳定性和可塑性正则化，有效解决了固定容量CNN的持续学习问题，在减少参数和计算量的同时实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: We present a regularization-based approach for continual learning (CL) of fixed capacity convolutional neural networks (CNN) that does not suffer from the problem of catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially. This method referred to as Group and Exclusive Sparsity based Continual Learning (GESCL) avoids forgetting of previous tasks by ensuring the stability of the CNN via a stability regularization term, which prevents filters detected as important for past tasks to deviate too much when learning a new task. On top of that, GESCL makes the network plastic via a plasticity regularization term that leverage the over-parameterization of CNNs to efficiently sparsify the network and tunes unimportant filters making them relevant for future tasks. Doing so, GESCL deals with significantly less parameters and computation compared to CL approaches that either dynamically expand the network or memorize past tasks' data. Experiments on popular CL vision benchmarks show that GESCL leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art method in terms of overall CL performance, as measured by classification accuracy as well as in terms of avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

TL;DR: AMIR-GRPO改进GRPO，通过DPO式对比正则化利用组内奖励排名信息，解决长度偏差和低质量轨迹惩罚不足问题，提升数学推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在复杂推理任务中存在结构限制：序列级优势归一化引入系统性长度偏差、低质量轨迹惩罚被稀释、标量目标丢弃了组内奖励排名中的丰富成对偏好信息，导致昂贵的rollout监督未被充分利用。

Method: 提出AMIR-GRPO，在GRPO基础上增加隐式DPO式对比正则化器，直接从组内奖励排名构建，无需额外标注。该机制增强对低奖励轨迹的抑制，减轻响应级长度偏差，并将每个rollout组转化为更密集的监督约束集。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AMIR-GRPO持续优于强GRPO基线，在正确和错误推理链之间产生更清晰的分离，并在标准GRPO已解决的实例子集之外提供更广泛的覆盖增益。

Conclusion: AMIR-GRPO通过利用组内奖励排名中的成对偏好信息，有效解决了GRPO在推理密集型设置中的结构限制，显著提升了强化学习对齐大型语言模型在复杂推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the primary paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) widely used in large-scale post-training. However, GRPO faces structural limitations in reasoning-heavy settings: sequence-level advantage normalization introduces systematic length bias, penalties for low-quality trajectories are diluted, and the scalar objective discards rich pairwise preference information embedded in within-group reward rankings. As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized.
  We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AMIR-GRPO consistently outperforms strong GRPO baselines, yields clearer separation between correct and incorrect reasoning chains, and delivers broader coverage gains beyond the subset of instances solved by standard GRPO.

Motivation: 现有异常检测方法在处理具有变化局部密度的数据集时存在局限性：基于距离的方法会错过局部异常，而基于密度的方法需要仔细的参数选择且具有二次时间复杂度。

Method: 提出SVEAD方法，构建集成随机Voronoi图，通过归一化的单元相对距离加权局部尺度来评分数据点，利用几何洞察将数据空间分解为受限区域进行独立分析。

Result: 在45个数据集上的实验表明，SVEAD优于12种最先进的方法，实现了线性时间复杂度和常数空间复杂度。

Conclusion: 通过将数据空间分解为受限区域并独立检查每个区域，SVEAD能够有效识别局部异常，解决了现有方法在处理变化局部密度数据集时的局限性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection aims to identify data instances that deviate significantly from majority of data, which has been widely used in fraud detection, network security, and industrial quality control. Existing methods struggle with datasets exhibiting varying local densities: distance-based methods miss local anomalies, while density-based approaches require careful parameter selection and incur quadratic time complexity. We observe that local anomalies, though indistinguishable under global analysis, become conspicuous when the data space is decomposed into restricted regions and each region is examined independently. Leveraging this geometric insight, we propose SVEAD (Stochastic Voronoi Ensembles Anomaly Detector), which constructs ensemble random Voronoi diagrams and scores points by normalized cell-relative distances weighted by local scale. The proposed method achieves linear time complexity and constant space complexity. Experiments on 45 datasets demonstrate that SVEAD outperforms 12 state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a framework for integrating physical laws with data. However, their application to Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) remains constrained by the limited uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities. Most existing PINN-based prognostics approaches are deterministic or account only for epistemic uncertainty, limiting their suitability for risk-aware decision-making. This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches. A systematic sensitivity study further analyzes the impact of boundary-condition, initial-condition, and residual sampling strategies on accuracy, calibration, and generalization. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of Bayesian physics-informed learning to support uncertainty-aware prognostics and informed decision-making in transformer asset management.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in contemporary engineering information systems for supporting decision-making across various industries, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted due to their capability in modeling sequential data. Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.

Abstract: With the rise of data-driven reaction prediction models, effective reaction descriptors are crucial for bridging the gap between real-world chemistry and digital representations. However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories. Combined with dimensionality reduction, RXNEmb enables visualization of reaction space diversity. Furthermore, attention weight analysis reveals the model's focus on chemically critical sites, providing mechanistic insight. RXNEmb serves as a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction fingerprinting and analysis, paving the way for more data-centric approaches in reaction analysis and discovery.

Abstract: Graph generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating complex graph structures, effectively capturing intricate dependencies and relationships within graph data. However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeAdv：一种基于树结构的优势重分配方法，用于提升基于群体的强化学习在复杂推理任务中的效率，相比GRPO和GSPO使用更少的生成token获得更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的GRPO将每个rollout轨迹视为独立的平坦序列，并为所有token分配单一序列级优势，这导致样本效率低下和长度偏差（倾向于冗长冗余的思维链而不提升逻辑深度）。

Method: TreeAdv通过熵驱动的采样方法构建树结构（森林），在高不确定性决策处进行分支，同时在rollouts间共享低不确定性token。然后通过重新分配完整rollouts（所有叶节点）的优势来聚合内部树段的token级优势。

Result: 在10个数学推理基准测试中，TreeAdv始终优于GRPO和GSPO，同时在相同的监督、数据和解码预算下使用显著更少的生成token。

Conclusion: TreeAdv通过显式利用rollouts的树结构进行探索和优势分配，解决了标准基于群体RL方法的样本效率低下和长度偏差问题，为复杂推理任务提供了更高效的强化学习框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with group-based objectives, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), is a common framework for aligning large language models on complex reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO treats each rollout trajectory as an independent flat sequence and assigns a single sequence-level advantage to all tokens, which leads to sample inefficiency and a length bias toward verbose, redundant chains of thought without improving logical depth. We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.

TL;DR: 该研究提出基于知识蒸馏的回归框架，在训练时使用蛋白质结构数据，推理时仅需序列数据，以提升蛋白质-蛋白质结合亲和力预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质-蛋白质结合亲和力预测面临预测准确性与数据可用性之间的权衡。实验解析的蛋白质结构数据缺乏限制了基于结构的机器学习模型的性能，而这类模型通常优于基于序列的方法。

Method: 提出基于知识蒸馏的回归框架：使用结构感知的教师网络指导序列基学生网络的训练，通过结合亲和力标签和中间特征表示进行联合监督。训练时使用结构数据，推理时仅需序列数据。

Result: 在非冗余蛋白质-蛋白质结合亲和力基准数据集上，序列基基线模型获得Pearson相关系数0.375和RMSE 2.712 kcal/mol，结构基模型获得0.512和2.445 kcal/mol。蒸馏基学生模型获得0.481和2.488 kcal/mol，显著提升了序列基性能。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是将结构知识转移到序列基预测器的有效方法，能够缩小序列基与结构基模型之间的性能差距。随着更大数据集的可用，该方法有望进一步改善性能。

Abstract: The trade-off between predictive accuracy and data availability makes it difficult to predict protein--protein binding affinity accurately. The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors. The source code for running inference with the proposed distillation-based binding affinity predictor can be accessed at https://github.com/wajidarshad/ProteinAffinityKD.

TL;DR: 论文揭示了Pivoted Cholesky分解在核方法中的几何解释：枢轴选择等价于使用核度量的最远点采样，Cholesky因子构建是隐式的Gram-Schmidt正交化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Pivoted Cholesky分解在数值线性代数中的代数性质已有充分研究，但在核方法背景下其几何直觉往往不明确。本文旨在阐明该算法在再生核希尔伯特空间中的几何解释。

Method: 在再生核希尔伯特空间框架下分析Pivoted Cholesky算法，证明枢轴选择步骤在数学上等价于使用核度量的最远点采样，而Cholesky因子构建是隐式的Gram-Schmidt正交化过程。

Result: 建立了Pivoted Cholesky分解与几何采样方法之间的理论联系，提供了简洁的推导和极简的Python实现，弥合了理论与实践之间的鸿沟。

Conclusion: Pivoted Cholesky分解不仅是一个高效的数值算法，还具有清晰的几何解释：它通过最远点采样选择代表性点，并通过正交化构建低秩近似，这为理解核方法中的低秩近似提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Low-rank approximations of large kernel matrices are ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly for scaling Gaussian Processes to massive datasets. The Pivoted Cholesky decomposition is a standard tool for this task, offering a computationally efficient, greedy low-rank approximation. While its algebraic properties are well-documented in numerical linear algebra, its geometric intuition within the context of kernel methods often remains obscure. In this note, we elucidate the geometric interpretation of the algorithm within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We demonstrate that the pivotal selection step is mathematically equivalent to Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) using the kernel metric, and that the Cholesky factor construction is an implicit Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We provide a concise derivation and a minimalist Python implementation to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

TL;DR: R³L提出了一种新的强化学习方法，通过反思-重试机制、关键信用分配和正信号放大，解决了LLM推理和智能体任务中的探索与利用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法在LLM推理和智能体任务中存在两个主要问题：探索方面成功率低且从头开始重复滚动的成本高；利用方面存在粗粒度信用分配和训练不稳定问题，轨迹级奖励会惩罚有效前缀，失败主导的样本会淹没少数正信号。

Method: R³L包含三个核心组件：1) 反思-重试机制，利用语言反馈诊断错误，将失败尝试转化为成功，并从失败点重新开始以降低滚动成本；2) 关键信用分配，只更新存在对比信号的分歧后缀，排除共享前缀；3) 正信号放大，对成功轨迹进行加权，确保正信号引导优化过程。

Result: 在智能体和推理任务上的实验表明，R³L相比基线方法取得了5%到52%的相对改进，同时保持了训练稳定性。

Conclusion: R³L通过主动合成高质量轨迹、精确信用分配和正信号放大，有效解决了强化学习在LLM推理和智能体任务中的探索与利用难题，为复杂任务提供了稳定高效的训练框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning drives recent advances in LLM reasoning and agentic capabilities, yet current approaches struggle with both exploration and exploitation. Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process. Experiments on agentic and reasoning tasks demonstrate 5\% to 52\% relative improvements over baselines while maintaining training stability. Our code is released at https://github.com/shiweijiezero/R3L.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ETR（弹性信任区域）算法，通过动态调整信任区域约束来解决GRPO在RLVR中的结构限制，实现更好的信号利用和探索保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR领域主导算法GRPO存在结构限制：对所有样本施加统一、静态的信任区域约束，这假设信号同质性，与结果驱动学习中优势幅度和方差显著波动的异质性现实不符。静态约束无法充分利用高质量信号，同时抑制噪声不足，常导致快速熵崩溃。

Method: 提出ETR（弹性信任区域）算法，通过双级弹性机制构建信号感知的优化景观：微观层面基于优势幅度缩放裁剪边界以加速高置信度路径学习；宏观层面利用组方差隐式分配更大更新预算给处于最优学习区域的任务。

Result: 在AIME和MATH基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ETR始终优于GRPO，在实现更高准确率的同时有效缓解策略熵退化，确保持续探索。

Conclusion: ETR通过动态信任区域约束解决了GRPO的结构限制，更好地适应了RLVR中的信号异质性，在保持探索的同时提高了学习效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an important paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, exemplified by the success of OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Currently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands as the dominant algorithm in this domain due to its stable training and critic-free efficiency. However, we argue that GRPO suffers from a structural limitation: it imposes a uniform, static trust region constraint across all samples. This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly. Consequently, static constraints fail to fully exploit high-quality signals while insufficiently suppressing noise, often precipitating rapid entropy collapse. To address this, we propose \textbf{E}lastic \textbf{T}rust \textbf{R}egions (\textbf{ETR}), a dynamic mechanism that aligns optimization constraints with signal quality. ETR constructs a signal-aware landscape through dual-level elasticity: at the micro level, it scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude to accelerate learning from high-confidence paths; at the macro level, it leverages group variance to implicitly allocate larger update budgets to tasks in the optimal learning zone. Extensive experiments on AIME and MATH benchmarks demonstrate that ETR consistently outperforms GRPO, achieving superior accuracy while effectively mitigating policy entropy degradation to ensure sustained exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前领域特定LLM微调主要采用静态课程学习策略，缺乏对模型训练过程中动态需求的适应性，限制了学习效率和效果。

Method: EDCO框架包含三个核心组件：1）使用前缀标记近似全序列熵的高效熵估计器；2）基于推理熵选择最高熵数据点的课程生成器；3）在选定课程上优化模型的LLM训练器。

Conclusion: EDCO通过动态调整课程顺序适应模型训练需求，显著提升了领域特定LLM微调的效率和效果，为自适应课程学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-specific large language models (LLMs), typically developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained general-purpose LLM on specialized datasets, represent a significant advancement in applied AI. A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy. However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration. Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum. EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum. Comprehensive experiments in communication, medicine and law domains, EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies for fine-tuning Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models under supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Furthermore, the proposed efficient entropy estimation reduces computational time by 83.5% while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: GEM-2是一个概率变换器模型，能够联合学习全球大气动力学和用户直接使用的决策相关变量，在轻量级架构下超越传统数值天气预报模型，并在决策价值指标上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天气预报用户面临一个困境：许多决策相关的目标（如极值、累积量、阈值超过）是大气状态变量的函数，而非状态变量本身。用户需要通过后处理来估计这些目标，这可能导致次优结果和结构偏差。核心问题是决策依赖于这些函数的分布，而模型并未直接训练学习这些分布。

Method: 提出GEM-2概率变换器，联合学习全球大气动力学和用户直接使用的变量套件。采用CRPS（连续排名概率得分）目标训练轻量级模型（约2.75亿参数），相比现有最先进模型实现20-100倍训练加速。

Result: GEM-2直接超越业务数值天气预报模型，与依赖昂贵多步扩散过程或需要定制多阶段微调策略的机器学习模型竞争。在决策理论评估下展示最先进的经济价值指标，在次季节到季节时间尺度上稳定收敛到气候学，并对许多通常假设的架构和训练设计选择表现出令人惊讶的不敏感性。

Conclusion: 通过直接学习决策相关变量的训练方法，轻量级变换器模型能够在保持计算效率的同时，在天气预报任务中实现卓越性能，为天气预报用户提供更直接有效的决策支持。

Abstract: Weather forecasts sit upstream of high-stakes decisions in domains such as grid operations, aviation, agriculture, and emergency response. Yet forecast users often face a difficult trade-off. Many decision-relevant targets are functionals of the atmospheric state variables, such as extrema, accumulations, and threshold exceedances, rather than state variables themselves. As a result, users must estimate these targets via post-processing, which can be suboptimal and can introduce structural bias. The core issue is that decisions depend on distributions over these functionals that the model is not trained to learn directly.
  In this work, we introduce GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer that jointly learns global atmospheric dynamics alongside a suite of variables that users directly act upon. Using this training recipe, we show that a lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup relative to state-of-the-art) transformer trained on the CRPS objective can directly outperform operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and be competitive with ML models that rely on expensive multi-step diffusion processes or require bespoke multi-stage fine-tuning strategies. We further demonstrate state-of-the-art economic value metrics under decision-theoretic evaluation, stable convergence to climatology at S2S and seasonal timescales, and a surprising insensitivity to many commonly assumed architectural and training design choices.

TL;DR: 论文提出潜在实例难度（LID）模型，分析具有内在异质难度的目标任务中神经缩放规律，发现泛化损失遵循标准缩放规律，但推理失败率（pass@k）的指数β_eff随训练样本增加而增长，最终饱和于难度分布尾部决定的内在极限β。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络在具有内在异质难度的目标任务中的缩放规律，特别是理解推理失败率（pass@k）如何随训练变化，以及泛化误差与推理性能之间的耦合关系。

Method: 提出潜在实例难度（LID）模型，其中每个输入的目标方差由潜在"精度"参数控制，该参数服从重尾分布。在最后一层微调的可解模型中分析神经缩放规律，推导闭式预测公式。

Result: 泛化损失恢复标准缩放规律，但pass@k失败率呈现幂律衰减k^{-β_eff}，其中β_eff随训练样本N增加而增长，最终饱和于难度分布尾部决定的内在极限β。学习过程缩小了误差分布的"硬尾"部分。

Conclusion: LID模型揭示了泛化误差与推理性能之间的耦合关系：模型泛化误差的改善使pass@k曲线变陡，直到不可约的目标方差占主导。这产生了可测试的闭式预测，包括计算分配规则（训练优先于饱和，推理尝试在后），并在模拟和真实数据中得到验证。

Abstract: We analyze neural scaling laws in a solvable model of last-layer fine-tuning where targets have intrinsic, instance-heterogeneous difficulty. In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-β_\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $β_\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $β$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.

Motivation: 表格数据训练的模型在敏感领域广泛应用，需要解释方法满足透明度需求。CFIRE算法虽然有效，但可能将不同类别的规则分配给同一样本，导致解释的模糊性

Method: 提出后剪枝策略，移除低贡献或冲突覆盖的规则，减少模型模糊性，同时保持保真度

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证实，该方法能显著减小模型规模、降低模糊性，同时对预测性能影响最小

Conclusion: 通过后剪枝策略可以有效解决CFIRE算法的规则冲突问题，获得更紧凑、更明确的解释模型，为敏感领域的透明决策提供更好的支持

Abstract: Models trained on tabular data are widely used in sensitive domains, increasing the demand for explanation methods to meet transparency needs. CFIRE is a recent algorithm in this domain that constructs compact surrogate rule models from local explanations. While effective, CFIRE may assign rules associated with different classes to the same sample, introducing ambiguity. We investigate this ambiguity and propose a post-hoc pruning strategy that removes rules with low contribution or conflicting coverage, yielding smaller and less ambiguous models while preserving fidelity. Experiments across multiple datasets confirm these improvements with minimal impact on predictive performance.

Abstract: Node classification is a fundamental problem in information retrieval with many real-world applications, such as community detection in social networks, grouping articles published online and product categorization in e-commerce. Zero-shot node classification in text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents a significant challenge, particularly due to the absence of labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-shot Prompt Tuning (ZPT) framework to address this problem by leveraging a Universal Bimodal Conditional Generator (UBCG). Our approach begins with pre-training a graph-language model to capture both the graph structure and the associated textual descriptions of each node. Following this, a conditional generative model is trained to learn the joint distribution of nodes in both graph and text modalities, enabling the generation of synthetic samples for each class based solely on the class name. These synthetic node and text embeddings are subsequently used to perform continuous prompt tuning, facilitating effective node classification in a zero-shot setting. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our framework performs better than existing state-of-the-art baselines. We also provide ablation studies to validate the contribution of the bimodal generator. The code is provided at: https://github.com/Sethup123/ZPT.

Method: 建立可复现的基准测试框架，标准化数据分割、特征和评估指标，在三个金融任务中比较量子模型与架构匹配的经典模型：方向性收益预测、实时交易模拟、已实现波动率预测。

Result: 量子方法在数据结构和电路设计良好对齐时表现更优：方向性分类中，混合量子神经网络在AAPL和KCHOL股票上分别提升3.8/3.4和4.9/3.6个AUC/准确率点；实时交易中，QLSTM在4个S&P 500机制中的2个获得更高风险调整收益；波动率预测中，角度编码QSVR在KCHOL上获得最低QLIKE。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a reproducible benchmarking framework that systematically compares QML models with architecture-matched classical counterparts across three financial tasks: (i) directional return prediction on U.S. and Turkish equities, (ii) live-trading simulation with Quantum LSTMs versus classical LSTMs on the S\&P 500, and (iii) realized volatility forecasting using Quantum Support Vector Regression. By standardizing data splits, features, and evaluation metrics, our study provides a fair assessment of when current-generation QML models can match or exceed classical methods. Our results reveal that quantum approaches show performance gains when data structure and circuit design are well aligned. In directional classification, hybrid quantum neural networks surpass the parameter-matched ANN by \textbf{+3.8 AUC} and \textbf{+3.4 accuracy points} on \texttt{AAPL} stock and by \textbf{+4.9 AUC} and \textbf{+3.6 accuracy points} on Turkish stock \texttt{KCHOL}. In live trading, the QLSTM achieves higher risk-adjusted returns in \textbf{two of four} S\&P~500 regimes. For volatility forecasting, an angle-encoded QSVR attains the \textbf{lowest QLIKE} on \texttt{KCHOL} and remains within $\sim$0.02-0.04 QLIKE of the best classical kernels on \texttt{S\&P~500} and \texttt{AAPL}. Our benchmarking framework clearly identifies the scenarios where current QML architectures offer tangible improvements and where established classical methods continue to dominate.

Motivation: 语义后门检测是一个重要但研究较少的问题。与基于触发模式的后门相比，语义后门更难检测，因为缺乏明确可识别的模式。研究动机源于消费者保护场景，监管机构需要测试机器学习服务提供商是否植入了后门。

Result: 该方法通常能够完全分离干净和中毒模型，并且优于现有的最先进后门检测器。在对抗训练设置下，通过模型反转生成的样本测量距离效果最佳。

Conclusion: 在已知训练数据和训练流程的消费者保护场景下，提出的方法能够有效检测语义后门攻击，特别是在要求对抗训练并使用模型反转生成样本测量距离的情况下，检测效果显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Detecting semantic backdoors in classification models--where some classes can be activated by certain natural, but out-of-distribution inputs--is an important problem that has received relatively little attention. Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples. With these settings, our method can often completely separate clean and poisoned models, and it proves to be superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detectors as well.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GAN虽然能生成逼真数据，但缺乏融入先验知识和逻辑一致性的机制，限制了在需要遵守规则的领域中的应用

Method: 提出LTN-GAN框架，将逻辑张量网络（LTN）集成到GAN中，在样本生成过程中强制执行领域特定的逻辑约束

Result: 在合成数据集（高斯、网格、环形）和MNIST数据集上的评估表明，LTN-GAN在遵守预定义逻辑约束方面显著优于传统GAN，同时保持生成样本的质量和多样性

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了神经符号方法在知识密集型领域增强生成建模的潜力

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Logic Tensor Network-Enhanced Generative Adversarial Network (LTN-GAN), a novel framework that enhances Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by incorporating Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) to enforce domain-specific logical constraints during the sample generation process. Although GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, they often lack mechanisms to incorporate prior knowledge or enforce logical consistency, limiting their applicability in domains requiring rule adherence. LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples. This work highlights the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches to enhance generative modeling in knowledge-intensive domains.

TL;DR: FALCON框架通过特征感知的分层token序列生成和知识蒸馏，提升单次联邦学习在非IID图像数据上的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单次联邦学习方法在真实世界领域（如医学影像）表现不佳，或在处理非IID数据时效率低下，需要更鲁棒和高效的解决方案

Method: 1) 使用预训练视觉编码器将图像压缩为分层token序列；2) 使用多尺度自回归transformer生成器建模token分布并生成合成序列；3) 客户端上传合成序列和本地分类器；4) 服务器端集成知识蒸馏进行全局训练

Result: 在医学和自然图像数据集上的实验表明，FALCON在多种非IID场景下有效，平均准确率比最佳OSFL基线高出9.58%

Conclusion: FALCON通过分层token序列生成和知识蒸馏，显著提升了单次联邦学习在非IID图像数据上的性能，为真实世界应用提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: One-shot federated learning (OSFL) reduces the communication cost and privacy risks of iterative federated learning by constructing a global model with a single round of communication. However, most existing methods struggle to achieve robust performance on real-world domains such as medical imaging, or are inefficient when handling non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences. Third, clients upload the synthetic sequences along with the local classifier trained on the real token sequences to the server. Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets validate the effectiveness of FALCON in diverse non-IID scenarios, outperforming the best OSFL baselines by 9.58% in average accuracy.

TL;DR: SR-MoE通过谱正则化约束路由流形几何结构，解决MoE架构中的专家崩溃问题，保持模块化结构完整性，实现稳定终身学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE架构虽然能高效扩展神经网络，但存在专家崩溃问题：路由收敛到少数主导专家，导致模型容量下降，并在适应过程中产生灾难性干扰。

Method: 提出谱正则化混合专家（SR-MoE），采用双重正则化：谱范数约束限制路由函数的Lipschitz连续性，稳定秩惩罚保持专家选择中高维特征多样性。

Result: 传统线性门控随深度增加失败（准确率下降达4.72%），而SR-MoE保持结构完整性（平均干扰-0.32%），促进正向知识转移，实现局部专家更新而无全局性能衰减。

Conclusion: SR-MoE为构建高容量、模块化网络提供通用解决方案，能够实现稳定的终身学习。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures enable efficient scaling of neural networks but suffer from expert collapse, where routing converges to a few dominant experts. This reduces model capacity and causes catastrophic interference during adaptation. We propose the Spectrally-Regularized Mixture of Experts (SR-MoE), which imposes geometric constraints on the routing manifold to enforce structural modularity. Our method uses dual regularization: spectral norm constraints bound routing function Lipschitz continuity, while stable rank penalties preserve high-dimensional feature diversity in expert selection. We evaluate SR-MoE across architectural scales and dataset complexities using modular one-shot adaptation tasks. Results show that traditional linear gating fails with increasing depth (accuracy drops up to 4.72% due to expert entanglement), while SR-MoE maintains structural integrity (mean interference -0.32%). Our spectral constraints facilitate positive knowledge transfer, enabling localized expert updates without global performance decay. SR-MoE provides a general solution for building high-capacity, modular networks capable of stable lifelong learning.

Motivation: 分析发现GRPO的裁剪机制在某些场景下不够理想，通过适当改进可以显著提升其灵活性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出ABC-GRPO（自适应边界裁剪GRPO），对原始GRPO框架进行非对称和自适应改进。

Result: 在Qwen3大语言模型的数学推理任务上，ABC-GRPO相比标准GRPO取得更优性能，训练过程中保持更高熵值，保留探索能力并缓解早熟收敛。

Conclusion: ABC-GRPO通过自适应边界裁剪有效改进了GRPO算法，在保持探索能力的同时提升性能，代码已开源便于复现。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a popular algorithm for reinforcement learning with large language models (LLMs). However, upon analyzing its clipping mechanism, we argue that it is suboptimal in certain scenarios. With appropriate modifications, GRPO can be significantly enhanced to improve both flexibility and generalization. To this end, we propose Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), an asymmetric and adaptive refinement of the original GRPO framework. We demonstrate that ABC-GRPO achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen3 LLMs. Moreover, ABC-GRPO maintains substantially higher entropy throughout training, thereby preserving the model's exploration capacity and mitigating premature convergence. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility https://github.com/chi2liu/ABC-GRPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究决策树与浅层神经网络在几何简单性和准确性之间的权衡，发现决策树的轴对齐边界与ReLU网络的几何复杂性存在冲突，提出了一种具有有限几何复杂性的平滑屏障评分函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究几何简单性（作为可解释性的一种形式）与浅层神经网络准确逼近轴对齐决策树能力之间的潜在冲突。决策树产生基于规则的轴对齐决策区域，而浅层ReLU网络通常作为评分模型训练，通过阈值化进行预测。

Method: 通过Radon总变差（RTV）半范数分析无限宽度、有界范数、单隐藏层ReLU网络类，该半范数控制水平集的几何复杂性。首先分析决策树指示函数的RTV性质，然后构建具有有限RTV的平滑屏障评分函数，并在温和的管质量条件下证明校准边界。

Result: 发现硬树指示函数具有无限RTV，两种自然的分段连续替代方法（分段线性斜坡平滑和Sigmoid平滑）在d>1维时也具有无限RTV，而高斯卷积产生有限RTV但具有指数依赖关系。构建的平滑屏障评分函数具有有限RTV，其固定阈值τ=1能精确恢复决策框。

Conclusion: 几何简单性与准确性之间存在权衡：决策树的轴对齐边界在几何上简单但难以用浅层神经网络准确逼近。通过构建具有有限几何复杂性的平滑评分函数，可以在保持决策区域恢复能力的同时实现更好的校准性能，这为理解神经网络的可解释性与准确性权衡提供了理论框架。

Abstract: We study when geometric simplicity of decision boundaries, used here as a notion of interpretability, can conflict with accurate approximation of axis-aligned decision trees by shallow neural networks. Decision trees induce rule-based, axis-aligned decision regions (finite unions of boxes), whereas shallow ReLU networks are typically trained as score models whose predictions are obtained by thresholding. We analyze the infinite-width, bounded-norm, single-hidden-layer ReLU class through the Radon total variation ($\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$) seminorm, which controls the geometric complexity of level sets.
  We first show that the hard tree indicator $1_A$ has infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$. Moreover, two natural split-wise continuous surrogates--piecewise-linear ramp smoothing and sigmoidal (logistic) smoothing--also have infinite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ in dimensions $d>1$, while Gaussian convolution yields finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ but with an explicit exponential dependence on $d$.
  We then separate two goals that are often conflated: classification after thresholding (recovering the decision set) versus score learning (learning a calibrated score close to $1_A$). For classification, we construct a smooth barrier score $S_A$ with finite $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ whose fixed threshold $τ=1$ exactly recovers the box. Under a mild tube-mass condition near $\partial A$, we prove an $L_1(P)$ calibration bound that decays polynomially in a sharpness parameter, along with an explicit $\mathrm{R}\mathrm{TV}$ upper bound in terms of face measures. Experiments on synthetic unions of rectangles illustrate the resulting accuracy--complexity tradeoff and how threshold selection shifts where training lands along it.

TL;DR: FOREVER是一个基于遗忘曲线启发的持续学习框架，通过模型时间对齐重放调度，有效缓解大语言模型中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法大多依赖固定的步数启发式策略，这些策略与模型实际学习进度往往不匹配，因为相同的训练步数可能导致不同程度的参数变化。研究发现大语言模型的遗忘模式与人类艾宾浩斯遗忘曲线相似，这启发了基于模型内部演化的重放调度设计。

Method: FOREVER提出模型时间概念，使用优化器更新幅度来衡量时间，使遗忘曲线启发的重放间隔与模型内部演化对齐。框架包含：1）基于遗忘曲线的重放调度器决定何时重放；2）强度感知的正则化机制自适应控制如何重放。

Result: 在三个持续学习基准测试和0.6B到13B参数范围的模型上进行广泛实验，结果表明FOREVER能持续有效地缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: FOREVER通过将重放调度与模型中心时间概念对齐，提供了一种更符合大语言模型学习动态的持续学习方法，相比传统固定步数策略能更好地匹配模型实际学习进度。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enable sequential knowledge acquisition without catastrophic forgetting. Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

Motivation: 传统生存预测模型通常将所有癌症分期数据混合训练，可能高估性能并忽略分期特异性差异。现有机器学习生存分析研究缺乏可解释性和透明度，需要开发能够揭示不同分期特征影响的模型。

Method: 使用SEER数据集，开发可解释的机器学习模型预测结直肠癌、胃癌和肝癌的阶段特异性生存率。应用SHAP和LIME等可解释性技术，分析特征与癌症分期之间的交互作用，识别不同分期中影响生存的关键变量。

Result: 成功识别了人口统计学和临床变量在不同癌症分期和类型中对生存率的不同影响。揭示了传统黑盒模型中隐藏的特征-癌症分期交互作用，为个性化治疗规划提供了临床相关见解。

Conclusion: 阶段特异性模型提供了对每个癌症分期最重要因素的新见解，通过可解释性技术增强了模型透明度，支持个性化治疗规划，具有临床相关性。

Abstract: Despite the fact that cancer survivability rates vary greatly between stages, traditional survival prediction models have frequently been trained and assessed using examples from all combined phases of the disease. This method may result in an overestimation of performance and ignore the stage-specific variations. Using the SEER dataset, we created and verified explainable machine learning (ML) models to predict stage-specific cancer survivability in colorectal, stomach, and liver cancers. ML-based cancer survival analysis has been a long-standing topic in the literature; however, studies involving the explainability and transparency of ML survivability models are limited. Our use of explainability techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabled us to illustrate significant feature-cancer stage interactions that would have remained hidden in traditional black-box models. We identified how certain demographic and clinical variables influenced survival differently across cancer stages and types. These insights provide not only transparency but also clinical relevance, supporting personalized treatment planning. By focusing on stage-specific models, this study provides new insights into the most important factors at each stage of cancer, offering transparency and potential clinical relevance to support personalized treatment planning.

Conclusion: 提出的透明推荐系统既能准确预测点击，又能提供可解释规则，使编辑能够将内容策划目标与目标受众行为对齐。

Abstract: News recommender systems are increasingly driven by black-box models, offering little transparency for editorial decision-making. In this work, we introduce a transparent recommender system that uses fuzzy neural networks to learn human-readable rules from behavioral data for predicting article clicks. By extracting the rules at configurable thresholds, we can control rule complexity and thus, the level of interpretability. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available news datasets (i.e., MIND and EB-NeRD) and show that we can accurately predict click behavior compared to several established baselines, while learning human-readable rules. Furthermore, we show that the learned rules reveal news consumption patterns, enabling editors to align content curation goals with target audience behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号回归因其可解释性在科学发现中特别有用。现有方法在处理类别变量时，要么只允许"非共享"参数（特定于类别值），要么包含"共享"参数（与类别值无关）。本文旨在扩展这些方法，考虑多类别变量并引入中间级别的参数共享，以进一步减少参数数量并揭示更多问题信息。

Method: 提出新的符号回归框架，支持多个类别变量和中间级别的参数共享。当存在两个类别变量时，引入在其中一个类别上共享但在另一个类别上变化的参数。通过合成数据测试数据需求减少和迁移学习的极限，并在天体物理数据集上验证方法有效性。

Result: 在合成数据测试中，新方法显著减少了数据需求并展示了迁移学习能力。在天体物理数据集上，与先前只考虑单类别变量的研究相比，获得了相似的拟合质量，但需要的个体参数数量显著减少，并提取了更多关于问题的信息。

Conclusion: 提出的多类别变量和中间级别参数共享方法在符号回归中具有优势，能够减少参数数量、降低数据需求，同时揭示更多关于问题的结构信息，为科学发现提供更强大的工具。

Abstract: Symbolic Regression aims to find symbolic expressions that describe datasets. Due to better interpretability, it is a machine learning paradigm particularly powerful for scientific discovery. In recent years, several works have expanded the concept to allow the description of similar phenomena using a single expression with varying sets of parameters, thereby introducing categorical variables. Some previous works allow only "non-shared" (category-value-specific) parameters, and others also incorporate "shared" (category-value-agnostic) parameters. We expand upon those efforts by considering multiple categorical variables, and introducing intermediate levels of parameter sharing. With two categorical variables, an intermediate level of parameter sharing emerges, i.e., parameters which are shared across either category but change across the other. The new approach potentially decreases the number of parameters, while revealing additional information about the problem. Using a synthetic, fitting-only example, we test the limits of this setup in terms of data requirement reduction and transfer learning. As a real-world symbolic regression example, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on an astrophysics dataset used in a previous study, which considered only one categorical variable. We achieve a similar fit quality but require significantly fewer individual parameters, and extract additional information about the problem.

Conclusion: 该工作推进了自回归图生成方法和计算运动学综合，为复杂机械系统的可扩展逆设计建立了新范式

Abstract: Designing mechanical linkages to achieve target end-effector trajectories presents a fundamental challenge due to the intricate coupling between continuous node placements, discrete topological configurations, and nonlinear kinematic constraints. The highly nonlinear motion-to-configuration relationship means small perturbations in joint positions drastically alter trajectories, while the combinatorially expanding design space renders conventional optimization and heuristic methods computationally intractable. We introduce an autoregressive diffusion framework that exploits the dyadic nature of linkage assembly by representing mechanisms as sequentially constructed graphs, where nodes correspond to joints and edges to rigid links. Our approach combines a causal transformer with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), both conditioned on target trajectories encoded via a transformer encoder. The causal transformer autoregressively predicts discrete topology node-by-node, while the DDPM refines each node's spatial coordinates and edge connectivity to previously generated nodes. This sequential generation enables adaptive trial-and-error synthesis where problematic nodes exhibiting kinematic locking or collisions can be selectively regenerated, allowing autonomous correction of degenerate configurations during design. Our graph-based, data-driven methodology surpasses traditional optimization approaches, enabling scalable inverse design that generalizes to mechanisms with arbitrary node counts. We demonstrate successful synthesis of linkage systems containing up to 20 nodes with extensibility to N-node architectures. This work advances autoregressive graph generation methodologies and computational kinematic synthesis, establishing new paradigms for scalable inverse design of complex mechanical systems.

Abstract: Objective: Ultra-wideband radar technology offers a promising solution for unobtrusive and cost-effective in-home sleep monitoring. However, the limited availability of radar sleep data poses challenges in building robust models that generalize across diverse cohorts and environments. This study proposes a novel deep transfer learning framework to enhance sleep stage classification using radar data. Methods: An end-to-end neural network was developed to classify sleep stages based on nocturnal respiratory and motion signals. The network was trained using a combination of large-scale polysomnography (PSG) datasets and radar data. A domain adaptation approach employing adversarial learning was utilized to bridge the knowledge gap between PSG and radar signals. Validation was performed on a radar dataset of 47 older adults (mean age: 71.2), including 18 participants with prodromal or mild Alzheimer disease. Results: The proposed network structure achieves an accuracy of 79.5% with a Kappa value of 0.65 when classifying wakefulness, rapid eye movement, light sleep and deep sleep. Experimental results confirm that our deep transfer learning approach significantly enhances automatic sleep staging performance in the target domain. Conclusion: This method effectively addresses challenges associated with data variability and limited sample size, substantially improving the reliability of automatic sleep staging models, especially in contexts where radar data is limited. Significance: The findings underscore the viability of UWB radar as a nonintrusive, forward-looking sleep assessment tool that could significantly benefit care for older people and people with neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying trajectory data generated by some nonlinear dynamics, where each class corresponds to a distinct dynamical system. We propose Dynafit, a kernel-based method for learning a distance metric between training trajectories and the underlying dynamics. New observations are assigned to the class with the most similar dynamics according to the learned metric. The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning. We also show that the kernel function can be tailored to incorporate partial knowledge of the dynamics when available. Dynafit is applicable to various classification tasks involving nonlinear dynamical systems and sensors. We illustrate its effectiveness on three examples: chaos detection with the logistic map, recognition of handwritten dynamics and of visual dynamic textures.

Motivation: 在数据稀缺情况下微调表格基础模型具有挑战性，因为即使在更稀缺的验证数据上进行早停，也往往无法捕捉到真实的泛化性能。需要一种能够增强微调鲁棒性和下游性能的方法。

Method: 提出CausalMixFT方法，使用在目标数据集上拟合的结构因果模型生成结构一致的合成样本。通过因果信息增强的合成示例来扩充有限的真实数据，保持特征依赖关系的同时增加训练多样性。

Result: 在TabArena的33个分类数据集和超过2300次微调运行中，CausalMixFT将归一化ROC-AUC中位数从0.10（标准微调）提高到0.12，优于CTGAN、TabEBM和TableAugment等纯统计生成器。同时将验证-测试性能相关性差距中位数从0.67缩小到0.30，实现了更可靠的基于验证的早停。

Conclusion: 将因果结构融入数据增强为在低数据情况下微调表格基础模型提供了一条有效且有原则的途径，显著提高了微调稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning tabular foundation models (TFMs) under data scarcity is challenging, as early stopping on even scarcer validation data often fails to capture true generalization performance. We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes.

Abstract: Automated blood morphology analysis can support hematological diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but remains sensitive to dataset shifts from staining variability, imaging differences, and rare morphologies. Building centralized datasets to capture this diversity is often infeasible due to privacy regulations and data-sharing restrictions. We introduce a federated learning framework for white blood cell morphology analysis that enables collaborative training across institutions without exchanging training data. Using blood films from multiple clinical sites, our federated models learn robust, domain-invariant representations while preserving complete data privacy. Evaluations across convolutional and transformer-based architectures show that federated training achieves strong cross-site performance and improved generalization to unseen institutions compared to centralized training. These findings highlight federated learning as a practical and privacy-preserving approach for developing equitable, scalable, and generalizable medical imaging AI in resource-limited healthcare environments.

### [145] [Clinical Data Goes MEDS? Let's OWL make sense of it](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04164)
*Alberto Marfoglia,Jong Ho Jhee,Adrien Coulet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEDS-OWL：一个轻量级OWL本体，将医疗事件数据标准（MEDS）与语义网生态系统连接，使MEDS数据集能够表示为RDF图，提升医疗数据的互操作性和可重现性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据缺乏标准化和语义明确的表示，导致数据集和实验之间的互操作性和可重现性有限。MEDS标准虽然解决了部分问题，但作为数据格式规范，未能与语义网生态系统集成。

Method: 提出MEDS-OWL本体，提供形式化概念和关系来表示MEDS数据集为RDF图；开发meds2rdf Python转换库，将MEDS事件转换为符合本体的RDF图；在颅内动脉瘤破裂患者护理路径的合成临床数据集上演示，并使用SHACL约束验证结果图。

Result: MEDS-OWL第一版包含13个类、10个对象属性、20个数据属性和24个OWL公理。结合meds2rdf，实现了数据向FAIR对齐数据集的转换、可追溯的发布以及基于事件的临床数据的互操作性。

Conclusion: 通过将MEDS与语义网连接，这项工作为基于事件的临床数据提供了可重用的语义层，并为后续基于图的分析建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on healthcare data is often hindered by the lack of standardized and semantically explicit representation, leading to limited interoperability and reproducibility across datasets and experiments. The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows from health data. However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, it enables data transformation into FAIR-aligned datasets, provenance-aware publishing, and interoperability of event-based clinical data. By bridging MEDS with the Semantic Web, this work contributes a reusable semantic layer for event-based clinical data and establishes a robust foundation for subsequent graph-based analytics.

*Mohit Raghavendra,Anisha Gunjal,Bing Liu,Yunzhong He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agentic Rubrics：一种通过专家代理与代码库交互创建上下文相关的检查清单，无需执行测试即可评估代码补丁的验证方法，在SWE-Bench上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前软件工程代理验证主要依赖代码执行，但环境设置开销大难以扩展；而可扩展的替代方法（如补丁分类器和启发式方法）缺乏代码库上下文且难以解释。

Method: 提出Agentic Rubrics方法：专家代理与代码库交互创建上下文相关的检查清单，然后根据该清单评估候选补丁而无需执行测试。

Result: 在SWE-Bench Verified的并行TTS评估中，Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B达到54.2%，Qwen3-32B达到40.6%，比最强基线至少提升3.5个百分点；rubric评分与真实测试一致，还能发现测试未捕获的问题。

Conclusion: Agentic Rubrics为软件工程代理提供了高效、可扩展且细粒度的验证信号，代理化的上下文收集对于产生代码库特定、明确的评估标准至关重要。

Abstract: Verification is critical for improving agents: it provides the reward signal for Reinforcement Learning and enables inference-time gains through Test-Time Scaling (TTS). Despite its importance, verification in software engineering (SWE) agent settings often relies on code execution, which can be difficult to scale due to environment setup overhead. Scalable alternatives such as patch classifiers and heuristic methods exist, but they are less grounded in codebase context and harder to interpret. To this end, we explore Agentic Rubrics: an expert agent interacts with the repository to create a context-grounded rubric checklist, and candidate patches are then scored against it without requiring test execution. On SWE-Bench Verified under parallel TTS evaluation, Agentic Rubrics achieve a score of 54.2% on Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B and 40.6% on Qwen3-32B, with at least a +3.5 percentage-point gain over the strongest baseline in our comparison set. We further analyze rubric behavior, showing that rubric scores are consistent with ground-truth tests while also flagging issues that tests do not capture. Our ablations show that agentic context gathering is essential for producing codebase-specific, unambiguous criteria. Together, these results suggest that Agentic Rubrics provide an efficient, scalable, and granular verification signal for SWE agents.

*Pietro de Oliveira Esteves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于PINNs的深度学习框架能在严重噪声条件下从非线性薛定谔方程中恢复物理参数，仅用500个含20%噪声的稀疏数据点就能以小于0.2%的相对误差重建非线性系数β，优于传统有限差分方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限差分方法在严重噪声条件下会因数值导数中的噪声放大而失效，而实验数据通常稀缺且噪声大，需要一种能在高测量不确定性下稳健工作的逆问题求解方法。

Method: 将物理信息神经网络(PINNs)与自动微分相结合，利用物理方程作为正则化项，仅需少量稀疏、随机采样的含噪声数据点来训练神经网络，从而恢复非线性薛定谔方程中的物理参数。

Result: 在β=0.5-2.0范围内，仅用500个含20%高斯噪声的数据点就能以小于0.2%的相对误差重建非线性系数β；在不同数据量(100-1000点)下保持亚1%精度；统计结果显示稳健性高(β=1.0时标准差小于0.15%)；整个流程约80分钟在Tesla T4 GPU上完成。

Conclusion: 物理正则化能有效过滤高测量不确定性，PINNs可作为传统优化方法的可行替代方案，用于时空动力学中数据稀缺且噪声大的逆问题求解；代码已公开以确保可复现性。

Abstract: We demonstrate a deep learning framework capable of recovering physical parameters from the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) under severe noise conditions. By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with automatic differentiation, we achieve reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficient beta with less than 0.2 percent relative error using only 500 sparse, randomly sampled data points corrupted by 20 percent additive Gaussian noise, a regime where traditional finite difference methods typically fail due to noise amplification in numerical derivatives. We validate the method's generalization capabilities across different physical regimes (beta between 0.5 and 2.0) and varying data availability (between 100 and 1000 training points), demonstrating consistent sub-1 percent accuracy. Statistical analysis over multiple independent runs confirms robustness (standard deviation less than 0.15 percent for beta equals 1.0). The complete pipeline executes in approximately 80 minutes on modest cloud GPU resources (NVIDIA Tesla T4), making the approach accessible for widespread adoption. Our results indicate that physics-based regularization acts as an effective filter against high measurement uncertainty, positioning PINNs as a viable alternative to traditional optimization methods for inverse problems in spatiotemporal dynamics where experimental data is scarce and noisy. All code is made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出轻量级测试时适应框架，使用TCN骨干网络，通过因果自适应批归一化、GMM对齐与经验回放、元学习三种策略，显著提升表面肌电信号长期解码的稳定性，减少跨会话性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表面肌电信号的长期解码受电极移位、肌肉疲劳和姿势变化引起的信号漂移影响，现有解决方案通常需要大数据集或高计算资源，不适用于低功耗可穿戴设备。

Method: 提出轻量级测试时适应框架，使用TCN骨干网络，包含三种部署就绪策略：1) 因果自适应批归一化实现实时统计对齐；2) GMM对齐与经验回放防止遗忘；3) 元学习实现快速少样本校准。

Result: 在NinaPro DB6多会话数据集上评估，该框架显著缩小了跨会话准确率差距，经验回放更新在有限数据下提供优越稳定性，元学习在少量样本下达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为长期假肢使用建立了稳健的"即插即用"肌电控制路径，实现了轻量级、高效的跨会话适应。

Abstract: Reliable long-term decoding of surface electromyography (EMG) is hindered by signal drift caused by electrode shifts, muscle fatigue, and posture changes. While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We propose a lightweight framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone. We introduce three deployment-ready strategies: (i) causal adaptive batch normalization for real-time statistical alignment; (ii) a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay to prevent forgetting; and (iii) meta-learning for rapid, few-shot calibration. Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 multi-session dataset, our framework significantly bridges the inter-session accuracy gap with minimal overhead. Our results show that experience-replay updates yield superior stability under limited data, while meta-learning achieves competitive performance in one- and two-shot regimes using only a fraction of the data required by current benchmarks. This work establishes a path toward robust, "plug-and-play" myoelectric control for long-term prosthetic use.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出SVL-DRL框架，使用分阶段强化学习解决医学图像分割中的噪声标注问题，通过体素级异步优势演员-评论家模块和复合奖励函数提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割依赖高质量标注数据，但器官形态复杂和标注者差异导致噪声标注普遍存在，严重影响分割模型性能。受标注者能基于先验知识修正错误的启发，需要自动减少噪声标注影响的方法。

Method: 提出端到端分阶段体素级深度强化学习框架：1) 将噪声标注建模为体素依赖问题；2) 采用体素级异步优势演员-评论家模块，每个体素作为自主智能体动态更新状态表示；3) 设计新的动作空间和结合Dice值与空间连续性的复合奖励函数。

Result: 在三个公开医学图像数据集上取得最先进性能，Dice和IoU分数平均提升超过3%，在各种实验设置下均表现优异。

Conclusion: SVL-DRL框架能有效处理医学图像分割中的噪声标注问题，通过动态迭代更新策略自动减少错误标签影响，无需人工干预，显著提升分割精度和语义完整性。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant advancements in medical image segmentation. Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity. Experiments on three public medical image datasets demonstrates State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance under various experimental settings, with an average improvement of over 3\% in both Dice and IoU scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 围棋长期以来作为人工智能的基准测试，需要复杂的战略推理和长期规划。以往方法如AlphaGo主要依赖基于模型的蒙特卡洛树搜索，本研究旨在探索模型无关强化学习在围棋中的有效性

Method: QZero基于熵正则化Q学习，使用单一Q值网络统一策略评估和改进，通过自博弈和离策略经验回放训练，无需人类数据或搜索过程

Result: 在5个月训练和7个GPU的有限计算资源下，QZero达到了与AlphaGo相当的性能水平，首次证明了模型无关强化学习在围棋中的有效性

Conclusion: QZero展示了模型无关强化学习在掌握围棋游戏中的效率，以及离策略强化学习在解决大规模复杂环境中的可行性

Abstract: The game of Go has long served as a benchmark for artificial intelligence, demanding sophisticated strategic reasoning and long-term planning. Previous approaches such as AlphaGo and its successors, have predominantly relied on model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In this work, we present QZero, a novel model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that forgoes search during training and learns a Nash equilibrium policy through self-play and off-policy experience replay. Built upon entropy-regularized Q-learning, QZero utilizes a single Q-value network to unify policy evaluation and improvement. Starting tabula rasa without human data and trained for 5 months with modest compute resources (7 GPUs), QZero achieved a performance level comparable to that of AlphaGo. This demonstrates, for the first time, the efficiency of using model-free reinforcement learning to master the game of Go, as well as the feasibility of off-policy reinforcement learning in solving large-scale and complex environments.

*Akarsh Kumar,Ryan Bahlous-Boldi,Prafull Sharma,Phillip Isola,Sebastian Risi,Yujin Tang,David Ha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Digital Red Queen (DRQ)算法，利用LLM在Core War游戏中通过自我对抗进化程序，模拟生物界的红皇后动态演化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM进化框架多为静态优化问题，忽略了真实世界演化中的开放对抗动态。生物演化中的"红皇后"动态（持续适应变化目标）在人工系统中研究不足。

Method: 提出DRQ自博弈算法：在Core War（图灵完备虚拟环境）中，LLM进化称为warriors的程序。每轮进化新warrior以击败所有先前warrior，形成持续适应序列。

Result: warrior随时间变得更通用（相对于人类warrior集）。有趣的是，独立运行中warrior行为多样性减少，表明向通用行为策略的收敛压力，类似自然界的趋同演化。

Conclusion: 从静态目标转向动态红皇后目标具有潜在价值。Core War可作为研究对抗适应的丰富沙箱。DRQ的简单有效性表明类似自博弈方法可用于网络安全、抗药性等实际对抗领域。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called "Red Queen" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.

Motivation: 大型语言模型常生成内容相关但不符合形式约束的输出，传统提示优化方法只关注重述主任务描述，忽略了作为响应接受标准的细粒度约束条件

Method: 提出多智能体工作流，将主任务描述优化与约束条件解耦，使用定量分数作为反馈，迭代重写和改进提示

Result: 该方法生成的修订提示在Llama 3.1 8B和Mixtral-8x 7B等模型上产生显著更高的遵从性分数

Conclusion: 通过解耦任务描述与约束条件优化，并使用定量反馈迭代改进，能有效提升LLM输出对形式约束的遵从性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.

Conclusion: 通过计算建模自我意识的方法有效提升了强化学习代理的性能，为理解AI中的心智理论提供了新视角，同时展示了疼痛感知模型在模拟人类行为方面的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding how artificial agents model internal mental states is central to advancing Theory of Mind in AI. Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer "pain-belief" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors.

TL;DR: CPGPrompt：一个自动提示系统，将叙述性临床指南转化为LLM可用的结构化决策树，在专科转诊决策上表现优异，但在多类路径分配上表现有差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践指南（CPGs）为患者护理提供循证建议，但将其整合到人工智能中仍面临挑战。现有方法如基于规则的系统存在可解释性差、指南依从性不一致和领域适用性窄等限制。

Method: 开发CPGPrompt自动提示系统，将CPGs转化为结构化决策树，利用LLM动态导航这些决策树进行患者病例评估。在三个领域（头痛、下背痛、前列腺癌）生成合成病例，测试不同决策场景。

Result: 二元专科转诊分类在所有领域表现一致强劲（F1: 0.85-1.00），召回率高（1.00 ± 0.00）。多类路径分配表现降低，领域间有差异：头痛（F1: 0.47）、下背痛（F1: 0.72）、前列腺癌（F1: 0.77）。性能差异反映了各指南的结构特点。

Conclusion: CPGPrompt能有效将叙述性临床指南转化为LLM可用的结构化决策支持系统，在二元决策任务上表现优异，但在复杂多类路径分配上需要进一步改进，特别是处理否定表达和时间推理等挑战。

Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care; however, integrating them into Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).
  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.
  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.

Motivation: 大型基础模型在医疗AI中展现出潜力，但能否提供真正个性化的治疗建议仍存疑问。研究发现存在多个悖论挑战，包括泛化性悖论、隐私-性能悖论、规模-特异性悖论和自动化-同理心悖论。此外，个性化推荐需要因果理解而非仅预测能力。

Method: 提出混合框架：大型基础模型利用多模态数据从群体模式中快速生成假设，提供带有不确定性估计的干预候选排名；N-of-1试验（交叉自我实验）作为个体因果推断的金标准，用于验证特定个体的因果效应。两者互补结合，基础模型触发后续的N-of-1试验。

Result: 论证了大型基础模型无法替代N-of-1试验，但两者可以互补。通过结合基础模型的预测能力和N-of-1试验的因果验证能力，可以解决个性化医疗中的悖论挑战，实现真正的个性化治疗。

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.

Abstract: We study continual skill acquisition in open-ended embodied environments where an agent must construct, refine, and reuse an expanding library of executable skills. We introduce the Programmatic Skill Network (PSN), a framework in which skills are executable symbolic programs forming a compositional network that evolves through experience. PSN defines three core mechanisms instantiated via large language models: (1)REFLECT for structured fault localization over skill compositions, (2) progressive optimization with maturity-aware update gating that stabilizes reliable skills while maintaining plasticity for uncertain ones, and (3) canonical structural refactoring under rollback validation that maintains network compactness. We further show that PSN's learning dynamics exhibit structural parallels to neural network training. Experiments on MineDojo and Crafter demonstrate robust skill reuse, rapid adaptation, and strong generalization across open-ended task distributions.\footnote{We plan to open-source the code.

*Kengo Nakamura,Masaaki Nishino,Norihito Yasuda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了加权模型计数（WMC）的方差计算问题，开发了在结构化d-DNNF上的多项式时间算法，并证明了该问题在结构化DNNF、d-DNNF和FBDD上的计算困难性，最后应用于贝叶斯网络推理的不确定性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际推理任务中，模型参数通常从数据中学习得到，存在不确定性。需要评估推理结果的不确定性程度，一种方法是引入参数分布并将推理结果视为随机变量，计算其方差。然而，计算这种方差的易处理性尚不清楚。

Method: 1. 为结构化d-DNNF推导出多项式时间算法来计算WMC方差；2. 证明该问题在结构化DNNF、d-DNNF和FBDD上的计算困难性；3. 将方法应用于贝叶斯网络推理，通过实验评估边际概率的方差。

Result: 1. 成功开发了在结构化d-DNNF上计算WMC方差的多项式时间算法；2. 证明了该问题在结构化DNNF、d-DNNF和FBDD上是困难的，这很有趣，因为后两者允许多项式时间WMC算法；3. 在真实世界贝叶斯网络上成功评估了边际概率的方差，并分析了参数方差对边际方差的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统性地研究了WMC方差计算问题的计算复杂性，为不确定性推理提供了理论基础和实用算法。研究揭示了虽然某些表示形式支持高效的WMC计算，但方差计算可能更加困难，这对实际应用中的不确定性量化具有重要意义。

Abstract: One of the most important queries in knowledge compilation is weighted model counting (WMC), which has been applied to probabilistic inference on various models, such as Bayesian networks. In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks. We empirically show that our algorithm can evaluate the variance of the marginal probability on real-world Bayesian networks and analyze the impact of the variances of parameters on the variance of the marginal.

Motivation: 现有基于安全规则推理的方法难以确定何种形式的安全推理能有效防御越狱攻击，这很难显式设计或直接获得

Method: 提出STAR-S框架，通过自学习循环集成安全规则推理学习：在安全规则引导下激发推理和反思，利用微调增强安全推理，形成协同循环

Result: 实验表明STAR-S能有效防御越狱攻击，性能优于基线方法

Conclusion: STAR-S通过自学习安全规则推理，为LLM安全部署提供了有效的防御框架

Abstract: Defending against jailbreak attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \textbf{STAR-S} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{TA}ught \textbf{R}easoning based on \textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CoT评估方法存在局限，无法区分性能提升是来自真正推理还是单纯token数量增加，需要更全面的过程中心化评估框架。

Method: 提出神经符号框架进行非侵入式、全面的过程中心化推理评估，识别四种行为原型，分析推理模式、训练策略和模型规模的影响。

Result: 发现扩展token生成不是深度推理的必要条件；训练中混合长短CoT数据会导致过早饱和和崩溃；小模型蒸馏能复制行为长度但无法达到逻辑效果。

Conclusion: 需要超越简单token计数的评估方法，理解LLM推理的复杂动态，并考虑训练数据构成和模型容量对推理能力的关键影响。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning, yet the limitations of current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation obscures whether performance gains stem from genuine reasoning or mere verbosity. To address this, (1) we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for the non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. (2) Through this lens, we identify four distinct behavioral prototypes and diagnose the failure modes. (3) We examine the impact of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale. Our analysis reveals that extended token generation is not a prerequisite for deep reasoning. Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.

TL;DR: SCRIBE是一个强化学习框架，通过技能原型库进行中间层奖励建模，减少奖励方差，提升工具增强代理在多步推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的奖励模型在工具增强代理训练中产生噪声和不一致的信号，主要因为缺乏细粒度、任务特定的评估标准来区分高层规划与低层执行。

Method: 引入SCRIBE框架，在中间层抽象进行干预，基于技能原型库进行奖励建模，将开放式LLM评估转化为约束验证问题，为每个子目标配备精确的结构化评估标准。

Result: 在多个推理和工具使用基准测试中达到最先进性能，将Qwen3-4B模型的AIME25准确率从43.3%提升到63.3%，显著提高复杂多轮工具交互的成功率。

Conclusion: SCRIBE与低层工具优化具有互补性，为构建更自主可靠的工具使用代理提供了可扩展的途径，中间层技能掌握先于有效高层规划行为的出现。

Abstract: Training reliable tool-augmented agents remains a significant challenge, largely due to the difficulty of credit assignment in multi-step reasoning. While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance.
  Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions.
  Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.

TL;DR: 提出SAE-Steering方法，通过稀疏自编码器解耦大推理模型的隐藏状态，识别策略特定特征作为控制向量，有效控制推理策略，提升推理可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大推理模型虽然展现类人认知推理策略，但自主选择策略常导致低效甚至错误的推理路径。现有方法难以控制细粒度推理策略，因为策略概念在隐藏状态中纠缠不清。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器将策略纠缠的隐藏状态解耦到特征空间，提出SAE-Steering两阶段特征识别流程：首先召回放大策略特定关键词logits的特征（过滤99%以上特征），然后按控制效果对剩余特征排序。

Result: SAE-Steering使用识别的策略特定特征作为控制向量，控制效果比现有方法提升15%以上。控制推理策略可将模型从错误路径转向正确路径，实现7%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 通过解耦隐藏状态并识别策略特定特征，SAE-Steering能有效控制大推理模型的推理策略，提高推理可靠性和准确性，为可控AI推理提供新方法。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit human-like cognitive reasoning strategies (e.g. backtracking, cross-verification) during reasoning process, which improves their performance on complex tasks. Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\% absolute accuracy improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型的思维链推理在符号领域有效，但直接应用于蛋白质功能理解效果不佳，因为蛋白质功能预测是知识密集型的科学任务，需要外部生物先验知识和计算工具而非纯内部推理

Method: 提出PFUA工具增强的蛋白质推理代理，统一问题分解、工具调用和基于证据的答案生成，通过领域特定工具产生可验证的中间证据，而非依赖长无约束的推理轨迹

Result: 在四个基准测试中，PFUA始终优于纯文本推理模型，平均性能提升103%

Conclusion: 蛋白质功能预测需要整合领域工具而非纯文本推理，PFUA通过工具增强方法有效解决了这一挑战，为生物信息学中的AI应用提供了新范式

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning in symbolic domains such as mathematics and programming. However, our study shows that directly transferring such text-based reasoning paradigms to protein function understanding is ineffective: reinforcement learning mainly amplifies superficial keyword patterns while failing to introduce new biological knowledge, resulting in limited generalization. We argue that protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally relies on external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. To address this gap, we propose PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation. Instead of relying on long unconstrained reasoning traces, PFUA integrates domain-specific tools to produce verifiable intermediate evidence. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that PFUA consistently outperforms text-only reasoning models with an average performance improvement of 103%.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型和Agentic AI技术的快速发展，需要系统化的架构指导来构建复杂的生产级系统。当前缺乏结合实践指导和形式化验证的架构框架，特别是在多智能体协调和治理方面。

Method: 提出三层设计模式分类：LLM Agents（任务特定自动化）、Agentic AI（自适应目标寻求者）、Agentic Communities（组织框架）。基于分布式系统协调原则，建立形式化框架，通过协作协议定义AI智能体与人类在治理生态系统中的角色。提供可验证的治理机制，确保操作和通信的可验证性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的架构方法为构建复杂的Agentic AI系统提供了可操作的实践指导和形式化验证能力，特别适用于需要严格治理的企业和工业应用场景，有助于实现动态多智能体生态系统的可靠部署。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLM) and subsequent Agentic AI technologies requires systematic architectural guidance for building sophisticated, production-grade systems. This paper presents an approach for architecting such systems using design patterns derived from enterprise distributed systems standards, formal methods, and industry practice. We classify these patterns into three tiers: LLM Agents (task-specific automation), Agentic AI (adaptive goal-seekers), and Agentic Communities (organizational frameworks where AI agents and human participants coordinate through formal roles, protocols, and governance structures). We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling. We validate this framework through a clinical trial matching case study. Our goal is to provide actionable guidance to practitioners while maintaining the formal rigor essential for enterprise deployment in dynamic, multi-agent ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过显式思考步骤取得显著成功，但这些步骤可能放大不安全行为。现有防御机制忽视了LRMs独特的推理动态，而研究发现思考步骤中安全提醒短语的出现对确保模型安全至关重要。

Method: 提出SafeRemind方法，在解码时动态向思考步骤注入安全提醒短语。利用熵触发器在决策锁定点进行干预，将潜在有害轨迹重定向到更安全的结果，无需参数更新。

Result: 在5个LRM和6个基准测试上的广泛评估表明，SafeRemind显著提升安全性，最高改善45.5个百分点，同时保持核心推理效用。

Conclusion: SafeRemind通过动态注入安全提醒短语，有效解决了大型推理模型思考步骤中的安全风险，提供了一种无需参数更新的高效防御方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 查询纠错需要高准确率且必须在实时延迟约束内完成。CoT推理能提高准确率但延迟过高，而先输出答案再推理的方法无法利用推理改进答案质量

Method: 提出SandwichR方法，采用"答案-推理-答案"范式：先生成初始纠错，然后进行显式推理，最后生成最终精炼纠错。使用一致性感知强化学习策略，通过一致性奖励对齐初始和最终答案，并采用基于边界的拒绝采样优先处理推理带来最大改进的边界样本

Result: 实验结果显示SandwichR达到与标准CoT相当的最先进准确率，同时实现40-70%的延迟降低，解决了在线搜索中的延迟-准确率权衡问题

Conclusion: SandwichR通过显式对齐快速初始答案与事后推理，实现了低延迟查询纠错而不牺牲推理感知的准确率，解决了实时查询纠错中的关键挑战

Abstract: Query correction is a critical entry point in modern search pipelines, demanding high accuracy strictly within real-time latency constraints. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.

Result: 覆盖率和规划时间大幅改善，能够处理至少28种药物的规划问题，向临床应用迈进了一步

Conclusion: 自动生成的领域特定启发式函数能有效扩展用药规划的规模，使其更接近实际临床应用需求

Abstract: Personalized medication planning involves selecting medications and determining a dosing schedule to achieve medical goals specific to each individual patient. Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.

Conclusion: EntroCoT能够有效识别和优化低质量思维链监督数据，构建高质量推理数据集，提升大语言模型的数学推理能力

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. We find existing fine-tuning datasets frequently suffer from the "answer right but reasoning wrong" probelm, where correct final answers are derived from hallucinated, redundant, or logically invalid intermediate steps. This paper proposes EntroCoT, a unified framework for automatically identifying and refining low-quality CoT supervision traces. EntroCoT first proposes an entropy-based mechanism to segment the reasoning trace into multiple steps at uncertain junctures, and then introduces a Monte Carlo rollout-based mechanism to evaluate the marginal contribution of each step. By accurately filtering deceptive reasoning samples, EntroCoT constructs a high-quality dataset where every intermediate step in each reasoning trace facilitates the final answer. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning on the subset constructed by EntroCoT consistently outperforms the baseslines of full-dataset supervision.

Conclusion: 将推理任务形式化为有序随机多选择背包问题，通过元认知和理性决策赋予LLM预算感知的理性能力，有效优化有限计算资源下的推理性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can achieve strong reasoning performance with sufficient computation, but they do not inherently know how much computation a task requires. We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies. Across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets.

Abstract: Defeasible entailment is concerned with drawing plausible conclusions from incomplete information. A foundational framework for modelling defeasible entailment is the KLM framework. Introduced by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, the KLM framework outlines several key properties for defeasible entailment. One of the most prominent algorithms within this framework is Rational Closure (RC). This paper presents a declarative definition for computing RC using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our approach enables the automatic construction of the minimal ranked model from a given knowledge base and supports entailment checking for specified queries. We formally prove the correctness of our ASP encoding and conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of our implementation with that of existing imperative implementations, specifically the InfOCF solver. The results demonstrate that our ASP-based approach adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and offers improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose an approach to model articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and to semi-automatically learn legal rules from examples based on prior judicial decisions. The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including "crimes against the person" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the "supportedness" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable. Furthermore, the tool integrates an inductive logic programming system for ASP, which is employed to generalize legal rules from case examples.

Abstract: Decision tree models, including random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees, are widely used in machine learning due to their high predictive performance.  However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification.  Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques.  In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP).  Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations.  We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: xDNN(ASP)能够为深度神经网络提供全局解释，揭示网络内部结构信息，并可用于优化网络结构（如减少隐藏层节点数）。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) has gained significant attention in recent years. Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their "black-box" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.

TL;DR: 本文探讨ASP在大型配置问题中的扩展性，特别是针对包含3万多个组件的电子系统配置，分析了当前ASP技术的潜力与限制，提出了约束感知猜测方法以减少内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP旨在实现"用户指定问题，计算机解决"的AI愿景，已在许多应用领域取得成功。但当前ASP求解技术能否扩展到大型配置问题？特别是电子系统配置可能包含超过3万个组件，这成为测试ASP扩展性的基准。

Method: 研究聚焦于解决"接地瓶颈"的方法，即问题实例规模增加时内存需求的急剧增长。首先调查了增量求解方法，然后基于接地分析开发了约束感知猜测方法，显著减少了内存需求。

Result: 增量求解方法在实践中证明有效，但内存需求仍构成显著限制。约束感知猜测方法通过减少内存需求，成功推动了ASP技术的极限。

Conclusion: ASP在大型配置问题中具有潜力，但内存需求是主要限制因素。约束感知猜测方法为解决接地瓶颈提供了有效途径，有助于ASP技术扩展到更大规模的问题实例。

Abstract: Answer set programming (ASP) aims to realize the AI vision: The user specifies the problem, and the computer solves it. Indeed, ASP has made this vision true in many application domains. However, will current ASP solving techniques scale up for large configuration problems? As a benchmark for such problems, we investigated the configuration of electronic systems, which may comprise more than 30,000 components. We show the potential and limits of current ASP technology, focusing on methods that address the so-called grounding bottleneck, i.e., the sharp increase of memory demands in the size of the problem instances. To push the limits, we investigated the incremental solving approach, which proved effective in practice. However, even in the incremental approach, memory demands impose significant limits. Based on an analysis of grounding, we developed the method constraint-aware guessing, which significantly reduced the memory need.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前基于视觉语言模型的智能体难以有效利用生成式世界模型进行未来状态预测，存在调用率低、误用率高、性能下降等问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能体面临更多需要预测未来状态的任务，生成式世界模型作为外部模拟器提供了解决方案，但需要实证检验当前智能体能否有效利用这些模型来增强认知能力

Method: 通过多种智能体和视觉问答任务进行实证研究，分析智能体调用模拟的频率、使用预测结果的方式，以及模拟可用或强制使用时性能的变化

Result: 发现智能体很少调用模拟（<1%），经常误用预测结果（约15%），且在模拟可用或强制使用时性能不一致甚至下降（最多5%）。归因分析显示主要瓶颈在于智能体决定何时模拟、如何解释预测结果以及如何将预见整合到下游推理的能力

Conclusion: 当前智能体难以有效利用世界模型进行预测性认知，需要开发促进校准、战略性交互的机制，以实现更可靠的预测性认知系统

Abstract: Agents built on vision-language models increasingly face tasks that demand anticipating future states rather than relying on short-horizon reasoning. Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.

TL;DR: Trade-R1：通过过程级推理验证将可验证奖励与随机金融环境连接，解决标准RL在金融市场中的奖励黑客问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL在数学和编程等可验证奖励领域表现出色，但在金融决策中面临挑战：市场具有随机性，奖励虽可验证但本质嘈杂，导致标准RL退化为奖励黑客

Method: 提出Trade-R1框架，通过过程级推理验证连接可验证奖励与随机环境。核心创新是将冗长金融文档的推理评估转化为结构化RAG任务，构建三角一致性指标（检索证据、推理链、决策之间的两两对齐），作为嘈杂市场回报的有效性过滤器。探索两种奖励整合策略：固定效应语义奖励（FSR）和动态效应语义奖励（DSR）

Result: 在不同国家资产选择实验中，该范式减少了奖励黑客问题，DSR实现了优越的跨市场泛化能力，同时保持了最高的推理一致性

Conclusion: Trade-R1通过过程级推理验证成功解决了金融决策中RL的奖励黑客问题，为随机环境中的可验证奖励应用提供了有效框架

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable reasoning in domains like mathematics and coding, where verifiable rewards provide clear signals. However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.

TL;DR: DOT方法通过动态截断冗余token来解决强化学习训练中模型在简单问题上过度推理的问题，在保持复杂问题推理能力的同时大幅减少推理token使用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习增强的推理模型在简单查询上会产生过度冗长的推理，导致部署成本高昂。现有的基于显式长度惩罚的方法存在优化冲突，且没有深入探究过度推理的生成机制

Method: 提出动态异常截断(DOT)：在训练时选择性抑制冗余token，仅针对完全正确rollout组中的极端长度尾部进行干预。同时结合辅助KL正则化和预测性动态采样以确保稳定收敛

Result: 在多个模型规模上的实验表明，该方法显著扩展了效率-性能的帕累托前沿。在AIME-24上，推理token使用减少78%，同时准确率相比初始策略有所提升，并超越了现有高效推理方法

Conclusion: DOT方法有效解决了模型在训练中出现的"长度偏移"现象，能够在保持复杂问题长程推理能力的同时，大幅提高推理效率，为高效推理提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Large reasoning models enhanced by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have achieved significant performance gains by extending their chain-of-thought. However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.

Conclusion: MobileDreamer通过高效的世界模型前瞻框架，显著提升了移动GUI智能体在长时程任务中的性能，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.

Abstract: AI-generated content has progressed from monolithic models to modular workflows, especially on platforms like ComfyUI, allowing users to customize complex creative pipelines. However, the large number of components in ComfyUI and the difficulty of maintaining long-horizon structural consistency under strict graph constraints frequently lead to low pass rates and workflows of limited quality. To tackle these limitations, we present ComfySearch, an agentic framework that can effectively explore the component space and generate functional ComfyUI pipelines via validation-guided workflow construction. Experiments demonstrate that ComfySearch substantially outperforms existing methods on complex and creative tasks, achieving higher executability (pass) rates, higher solution rates, and stronger generalization.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).
  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.
  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.
