### [1] [LVTINO: LAtent Video consisTency INverse sOlver for High Definition Video Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01339)
*Alessio Spagnoletti,Andrés Almansa,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVTINO是首个基于视频一致性模型(VCMs)的零样本高分辨率视频修复方法，通过利用VCMs的时间因果性来确保时间一致性，避免了逐帧应用图像扩散模型导致的时间不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本图像逆求解器使用蒸馏的文本到图像潜在扩散模型(LDMs)在图像修复中取得了显著成果，但将其直接应用于视频修复时，由于需要同时恢复精细空间细节和捕捉时间依赖性，逐帧应用会导致时间不一致的重建结果。

Method: 利用视频一致性模型(VCMs)将视频潜在扩散模型蒸馏为快速生成器，显式捕捉时间因果关系。提出的LVTINO方法通过条件机制绕过自动微分需求，仅需少量神经网络评估即可实现高质量视频重建。

Result: 在多种视频逆问题上的广泛实验表明，与当前最先进的逐帧应用图像LDMs的方法相比，LVTINO在重建保真度和计算效率方面都取得了显著感知改进，建立了新的性能基准。

Conclusion: LVTINO通过利用VCMs的时间因果先验，成功解决了高分辨率视频修复中的时间一致性问题，在保证强测量一致性和平滑时间过渡的同时，实现了最先进的视频重建质量。

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

### [2] [Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347)
*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于三阶段训练的风格提取图像生成方法，使用风格编码器和风格投影层将风格表示与文本表示对齐，实现细粒度文本提示的风格引导生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成模型中细粒度风格无法通过自然语言精确描述和控制的问题，以及风格参考图像的指导信息难以与文本条件直接对齐的挑战。

Method: 使用风格编码器和风格投影层从单张风格参考图像中提取细粒度风格表示，并将其注入到预训练生成模型中，不改变下游生成模型的结构框架。构建了包含图像、风格标签和文本描述三元组的Style30k-captions数据集。

Result: 实现了细粒度控制的风格化图像生成，能够从单张风格参考图像中提取风格表示，并与文本条件对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法能够最大化预训练生成模型的生成能力，通过风格提取和投影技术实现细粒度的风格控制，解决了风格参考图像与文本条件对齐的难题。

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

### [3] [EvoStruggle: A Dataset Capturing the Evolution of Struggle across Activities and Skill Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01362)
*Shijia Feng,Michael Wray,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究收集了一个包含61.68小时视频、2,793个视频片段和5,385个标注时间段的挣扎检测数据集，用于研究技能学习过程中挣扎的演变。通过18个任务和4种活动类型，展示了时间动作定位模型能够成功检测挣扎信号，并在未见过的任务和活动中实现一定程度的泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有操作数据集没有关注挣扎随时间的演变过程，而理解这种演变对于确定用户当前学习阶段和开发有效的辅助系统至关重要。

Method: 收集了76名参与者的数据集，包含4种不同活动（打结、折纸、七巧板、洗牌）的18个任务，每个任务重复5次以捕捉技能演变。将挣扎检测问题定义为时间动作定位任务，识别和精确定位挣扎片段的起止时间。

Result: 时间动作定位模型能够成功学习检测挣扎信号，在跨任务泛化时达到34.56%的平均mAP，跨活动泛化时达到19.24%的平均mAP，表明挣扎是一个可跨各种技能任务迁移的概念。

Conclusion: 挣扎是一个可跨任务和活动迁移的概念，时间动作定位模型能够有效检测挣扎，但仍有改进空间。该数据集为研究技能学习过程中的挣扎演变提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

### [4] [SPUS: A Lightweight and Parameter-Efficient Foundation Model for PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01370)
*Abu Bucker Siddik,Diane Oyen,Alexander Most,Michal Kucer,Ayan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPUS是一个紧凑高效的偏微分方程求解基础模型，使用轻量级残差U-Net架构，通过自回归预训练策略学习物理规律，在多种PDE任务上实现最先进的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PDE基础模型主要基于大型复杂Transformer架构，计算和参数开销大，需要探索更轻量高效的架构。

Method: 采用轻量级残差U-Net架构，使用自回归预训练策略模拟数值求解器行为，在流体动力学PDE数据集上预训练。

Result: 在6个未见下游PDE任务上实现最先进泛化性能，参数数量显著减少，只需少量微调数据。

Conclusion: SPUS展示了作为参数高效基础模型解决多样化PDE系统的潜力，残差U-Net架构在此领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

### [5] [DisCo: Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints for Multi-Human Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01399)
*Shubhankar Borse,Farzad Farhadzadeh,Munawar Hayat,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过多样性约束直接优化多人生成中的身份多样性，解决了文本到图像模型在多人提示下重复面孔、合并身份和计数错误的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在现实主义方面表现出色，但在多人提示下表现不佳，会出现重复面孔、合并身份和计数错误的问题，这被称为生成模型中的身份危机。

Method: DisCo通过组相对策略优化(GRPO)微调流匹配模型，使用组合奖励函数：(i)惩罚图像内面部相似性，(ii)阻止跨样本身份重复，(iii)确保准确人数计数，(iv)通过人类偏好分数保持视觉保真度。采用单阶段课程学习来稳定训练。

Result: 在DiverseHumans测试集上，DisCo实现了98.6%的独特面孔准确率和接近完美的全局身份分布，超越了开源和专有方法(如Gemini、GPT-Image)，同时保持了竞争性的感知质量。

Conclusion: DisCo作为一个可扩展、无需额外标注的解决方案，解决了生成模型中长期存在的身份危机问题，为组合式多人生成设立了新的基准。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

### [6] [GeoSURGE: Geo-localization using Semantic Fusion with Hierarchy of Geographic Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01448)
*Angel Daruna,Nicholas Meegan,Han-Pang Chiu,Supun Samarasekera,Rakesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉地理定位方法，通过将查询图像的视觉表示与学习的地理表示对齐，使用层次化地理嵌入模型，并融合外观特征和语义分割图来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球视觉地理定位旨在仅使用图像视觉内容确定其在地球上的地理位置，现有方法在地理表示学习方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 将地理定位建模为查询图像视觉表示与学习的地理表示对齐；使用层次化地理嵌入模型表示世界；提出有效融合图像外观特征和语义分割图的方法。

Result: 在5个基准数据集的25个指标中，22个指标超过了现有最先进方法和大型视觉语言模型，创造了新的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 性能提升主要归功于地理表示和视觉表示的有效结合，该方法在视觉地理定位任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

### [7] [Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454)
*Nilay Naharas,Dang Nguyen,Nesihan Bulut,Mohammadhossein Bateni,Vahab Mirrokni,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了XMAS方法，通过分析跨模态注意力矩阵的轨迹来聚类训练样本，从而在LVLM指令调优中实现数据高效学习，能够大幅减少训练数据量而不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法在大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)中表现不佳，甚至无法超越随机选择。需要开发专门针对LVLM指令调优的数据高效学习方法。

Method: XMAS方法：证明具有相似跨模态注意力矩阵的样本具有相似梯度；基于小规模代理LVLM微调时注意力矩阵的顶部奇异值轨迹对样本进行聚类；从聚类中平衡采样构建训练子集。

Result: 能够丢弃LLaVA-665k数据集的50%和Vision-Flan数据集的85%，完全保持LLaVA-1.5-7B在10个下游基准上的性能，训练速度提升1.2倍，比最佳基线多减少30%数据。

Conclusion: XMAS是首个针对LVLM指令调优的原则性数据高效学习方法，通过注意力矩阵分析有效消除大规模训练数据中的冗余，显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

### [8] [Purrception: Variational Flow Matching for Vector-Quantized Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01478)
*Răzvan-Andrei Matişan,Vincent Tao Hu,Grigory Bartosh,Björn Ommer,Cees G. M. Snoek,Max Welling,Jan-Willem van de Meent,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Floor Eijkelboom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Purrception是一种用于向量量化图像生成的变分流匹配方法，结合了连续传输动态和明确的分类监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在向量量化图像生成中同时保持连续传输动态和提供明确的分类监督，结合连续方法的几何感知能力和分类方法的离散监督优势。

Method: 通过在学习码本索引的分类后验的同时，在连续嵌入空间中计算速度场，将变分流匹配适应于向量量化潜在空间。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k 256x256生成任务上，训练收敛速度比连续流匹配和离散流匹配基线更快，同时达到与最先进模型竞争的FID分数。

Conclusion: 变分流匹配可以有效桥接连续传输和离散监督，提高图像生成的训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

### [9] [AortaDiff: A Unified Multitask Diffusion Framework For Contrast-Free AAA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01498)
*Yuxuan Ou,Ning Bi,Jiazhen Pan,Jiancheng Yang,Boliang Yu,Usama Zidan,Regent Lee,Vicente Grau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的深度学习框架，通过条件扩散模型和多任务学习，从非对比CT扫描中生成合成对比增强CT图像，同时分割主动脉腔和血栓，避免了多阶段方法的误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比增强CT需要碘对比剂，存在肾毒性、过敏反应和环境危害等风险。现有方法采用多阶段流程，导致误差累积且无法利用共享的语义和解剖结构。

Method: 集成条件扩散模型与多任务学习，实现端到端的图像合成和解剖分割联合优化。共享编码器和解码器参数，采用半监督训练策略处理缺失分割标签的临床数据。

Result: 在264名患者队列中表现优异：图像合成PSNR达25.61 dB（单任务CDM为23.80 dB）；腔分割Dice分数提升至0.89（nnU-Net为0.87），血栓分割Dice分数提升至0.53（nnU-Net为0.48）；临床测量误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 该统一框架在减少对比剂使用的同时，显著提升了图像合成质量和解剖分割精度，为临床实践提供了更安全准确的替代方案。

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

### [10] [From Videos to Indexed Knowledge Graphs -- Framework to Marry Methods for Multimodal Content Analysis and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01513)
*Basem Rizk,Joel Walsh,Mark Core,Benjamin Nye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于多模态内容分析的高效原型框架，将预训练模型与视频数据结合，生成可查询的知识图谱表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态内容分析通常计算成本高且工程复杂，现有预训练模型难以直接应用于视频等复杂数据。

Method: 设计候选流程，结合预训练模型将视频转换为时序半结构化数据，再进一步转换为帧级索引知识图谱。

Result: 创建了可查询的知识图谱表示，支持持续学习，能够通过交互方式动态整合新的领域知识。

Conclusion: 该框架简化了多模态内容分析的原型开发，提高了处理复杂数据的效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WALT框架通过逆向工程将网站功能转化为可调用工具，使Web代理能够使用高级操作（如搜索、过滤、排序）而非逐步UI交互，提高浏览器自动化的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Web代理方法依赖逐步UI交互和大量LLM推理，在动态布局和长任务中表现脆弱，而人类通过网站提供的高级功能操作更高效。

Method: WALT逆向工程网站潜在功能，将其转化为可重用的调用工具，涵盖发现（搜索、过滤、排序）、通信（发布、评论、点赞）和内容管理（创建、编辑、删除）等操作。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena测试中，WALT以更少步骤和更少LLM依赖实现更高成功率。

Conclusion: WALT建立了从脆弱逐步推理转向可靠工具调用的鲁棒可泛化浏览器自动化范式。

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

*Meilong Xu,Xiaoling Hu,Shahira Abousamra,Chen Li,Chao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督分割框架，通过拓扑一致性机制来识别和保留有意义的语义结构，特别适用于密集分布的病理图像分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半监督分割中，从未标记数据中捕获有意义的语义结构至关重要，特别是在病理图像分析中，对象密集分布，这带来了挑战。

Method: 利用通过随机dropout和时间训练快照获得的多个扰动预测，强制执行这些不同输出之间的拓扑一致性，并引入一种结合空间重叠和全局结构对齐的新型匹配策略。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，该方法有效减少了拓扑错误，产生了更稳健和准确的分割结果。

Conclusion: 该方法对于可靠的下游分析至关重要，能够产生更稳健和准确的分割结果。

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Diffusion-LPO框架，用于在扩散模型中优化列表式偏好，通过Plackett-Luce模型扩展DPO目标，在图像生成、编辑和个性化偏好对齐任务中优于成对DPO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法主要依赖成对偏好，但人类对图像的反馈通常包含隐含的排名信息，能更精确地表达偏好。列表式偏好的精确优化尚未得到充分解决。

Method: 提出Diffusion-LPO框架，将用户反馈聚合成图像排名列表，在Plackett-Luce模型下推导DPO目标的列表式扩展，强制整个排名的一致性，鼓励每个样本优于其所有低排名替代项。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、图像编辑和个性化偏好对齐等任务中，Diffusion-LPO在视觉质量和偏好对齐方面始终优于成对DPO基线方法。

Conclusion: Diffusion-LPO是一个简单有效的列表式偏好优化框架，能够更好地利用人类反馈中的排名信息，提升扩散模型与人类偏好的对齐效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建同时支持理解和生成的统一多模态大语言模型具有挑战性：混合方法破坏了自回归范式，而纯自回归方法在语义对齐和像素级保真度之间存在权衡。

Method: 采用混合Transformer架构，通过语义到像素的离散表示整合紧凑语义token和细粒度像素token，在预训练视觉理解模型基础上增加生成能力。

Result: 在多样化多模态基准测试中，Bridge在理解和生成任务上都取得了竞争性或更优的结果，同时需要更少的训练数据和更短的训练时间。

Conclusion: Bridge证明了在单一自回归框架内实现高质量多模态理解和生成的可行性，通过创新的离散表示方法平衡了语义对齐和视觉保真度。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

*Akshay Bhagwan Sonawane,Lena D. Swamikannan,Lakshman Tamil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CNN和贝叶斯深度学习的混合模型，用于在训练数据有限的情况下进行口腔癌分类，通过不确定性量化提高模型可靠性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口腔癌是全球高发癌症，早期诊断对降低死亡率至关重要。传统深度学习模型在数据稀缺环境下存在过度自信和泛化能力不足的问题，需要大训练数据集，这在医疗资源匮乏地区不现实。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络与贝叶斯深度学习相结合的混合模型，采用变分推理进行不确定性量化，使用智能手机拍摄的彩色照片进行训练。

Result: 在训练数据分布相似的测试集上达到94%准确率，与传统CNN相当；在真实世界照片数据上表现更优，达到88%准确率（传统CNN为72.94%），且对正确分类样本显示低不确定性，对错误分类样本显示高不确定性。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯推理在数据稀缺环境下能有效提升口腔癌早期诊断的模型可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CADTrans的源自由域自适应方法，通过构建辅助域来获取多样化表示，使用一致性策略获得不变特征表示，并采用条件多核最大均值差异策略对齐硬样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 源自由域自适应面临无法直接访问源域数据的挑战，现有方法主要关注评估目标域中与源域相似的不变特征，但容易受到硬样本和域偏差的影响。

Method: 开发辅助域模块从中间聚合全局注意力获取多样化表示，基于辅助域和目标域通过多重一致性策略获得不变特征表示，构建条件多核最大均值差异策略来对齐硬样本。

Result: 在Office-31、Office-Home、VISDA-C和DomainNet-126等多个基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明了所提方法带来的显著性能提升。

Conclusion: CADTrans方法通过构建域一致性的不变特征表示，有效解决了源自由域自适应中的硬样本和域偏差问题，取得了显著的性能改进。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

*Ricardo Gonzalez Penuela,Felipe Arias-Russi,Victor Capriles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个系统，利用BLV用户的历史问题来指导多模态大语言模型生成更相关的图像描述，而不是默认的全面冗长描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MLLM应用往往提供冗长全面的描述，缺乏上下文相关性，导致BLV用户需要筛选大量无关信息才能获得所需的具体信息。

Method: 系统从VizWiz-LF数据集中识别相似的视觉上下文，利用相关历史问题来指导MLLM生成更符合BLV用户需求的描述。

Result: 评估显示，76.1%的情境感知描述能够预测并回答用户问题，在54.4%的比较中被用户偏好。

Conclusion: 利用BLV用户历史问题指导MLLM可以生成更相关、更有效的图像描述，提高信息交换效率。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

multimodal reasoning models. We capture the step-by-step reasoning process of
VLMs and the final descriptive answers. Our goal with this dataset is to enable
the development of more robust VLMs while contributing to the broader

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正则化方法NPN，通过神经网络学习感知矩阵零空间的低维投影，而不是在图像域施加结构约束，从而提升图像逆问题的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图像逆问题解决方法通常忽略感知矩阵零空间的特定结构，而NPN方法旨在利用零空间的结构信息来设计更有效的正则化器。

Method: 使用神经网络学习感知矩阵零空间的低维投影，将解约束在该投影空间中，这种方法可以与现有的重建框架兼容，并补充传统的图像域先验。

Result: 在压缩感知、去模糊、超分辨率、计算机断层扫描和磁共振成像等多种逆问题中，NPN先验都能显著提升重建保真度，适用于plug-and-play方法、展开网络、深度图像先验和扩散模型。

Conclusion: NPN方法通过关注感知矩阵零空间的结构，提供了一种可解释且灵活的正则化方法，能够有效提升各种图像逆问题的重建性能。

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Conclusion: 该工作为基因组医学中的机器人和临床自动化建立了可靠基础，实现了可解释基因组建模与自动化决策的有效结合。

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation
in genomic medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型缺乏显式的逐步推理过程，直接输出最终动作而不考虑可操作性约束或几何关系，且后训练流程很少强化推理质量。

Method: 提出RLVR后训练策略，使用可验证奖励进行区域对齐、轨迹一致性和输出格式优化；开发VLA-CoT-13K高质量数据集，提供与可操作性和轨迹标注明确对齐的思维链监督。

Result: 在领域内、领域外、仿真和真实机器人平台上的广泛评估表明，VLA-R1相比之前的VLA方法实现了更优越的泛化能力和真实世界性能。

Conclusion: VLA-R1通过系统优化推理和执行能力，显著提升了VLA模型的泛化性能和实际应用效果。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this
work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合去模糊和3D重建的方法，用于解决微距摄影中的散焦模糊问题，通过可微分渲染实现自监督优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微距摄影具有高分辨率和大放大倍数的优势，但散焦模糊严重阻碍了清晰成像和高质量3D重建。传统方法需要大量图像和标注，且目前没有针对微距摄影的多视角3D重建方法。

Method: 从多视角模糊图像出发，联合优化物体的清晰3D模型和每个像素的散焦模糊核。整个框架采用可微分渲染方法，自监督优化3D模型和散焦模糊核。

Result: 大量实验表明，从少量多视角图像出发，该方法不仅能实现高质量图像去模糊，还能恢复高保真度的3D外观。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了微距摄影中的散焦模糊问题，实现了联合去模糊和3D重建，为小尺寸细节物体的高质量3D建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像去模糊方法存在推理时间过长和保真度不足的问题，限制了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Method: 将运动去模糊重新定义为扩散过程，每个时间步代表逐渐模糊的图像；训练一致性模型将所有时间步对齐到同一清晰图像；结合Kernel ControlNet进行模糊核估计和自适应时间步预测。

Conclusion: FideDiff为预训练扩散模型在高保真图像恢复任务中的应用提供了新方向，为在现实工业应用中推进扩散模型建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青铜器铭文是早期中国文字的重要阶段，但由于严重的视觉退化、多领域变异性（照片、拓片、摹本）和极长的字符分布尾端，自动识别仍面临困难。

Method: 构建大规模BI数据集（22454张全页图像，198598个标注字符，6658个类别），开发两阶段检测-识别流程，使用LadderMoE增强预训练的CLIP编码器，通过梯级MoE适配器实现动态专家专业化。

Result: 在单字符和全页识别任务上显著优于最先进的场景文本识别基线方法，在头部、中部和尾部类别以及所有采集模态上都取得了优越的准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法为青铜器铭文识别和下游考古分析建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

TL;DR: VirDA提出了一种通过视觉重编程实现参数高效的领域自适应方法，仅需训练少量参数即可在不同域间重用预训练骨干网络，显著减少存储和计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UDA方法需要为每个源-目标对微调整个骨干网络，导致参数数量和存储需求线性增长，且无法重用训练好的骨干参数。

Method: 在骨干网络前添加领域特定的视觉重编程层，生成视觉提示作为纹理偏置来调整输入图像的风格，使用多目标函数优化域内和域间分布差异，不修改骨干网络参数。

Result: 在Office-31数据集上达到92.8%的平均准确率，仅需1.5M可训练参数，优于现有参数高效UDA基线方法，且参数使用量大幅减少。

Conclusion: VirDA通过视觉重编程实现了参数高效的领域自适应，能够在保持性能的同时显著减少参数数量和存储需求，支持骨干网络在不同域间的重用。

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为离散面部编码(DFE)的无监督方法，通过残差向量量化变分自编码器从3D网格序列中学习紧凑且可解释的面部表情字典，在心理任务中优于传统FACS系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部表情编码系统如FACS存在覆盖范围有限和手动标注成本高的问题，需要一种数据驱动的替代方案。

Method: 使用3D形变模型提取身份不变的表情特征，然后通过RVQ-VAE编码这些特征，生成来自共享码本的离散标记序列，每个标记捕获特定的可重用面部变形模式。

Result: 在压力检测、人格预测和抑郁检测三个心理任务中，基于学习标记的简单词袋模型持续优于FACS基线和强大的图像视频表示学习模型。

Conclusion: DFE能够比FACS捕获更精确的面部行为，覆盖更广泛的面部表情，为心理和情感计算应用提供了可扩展且有效的FACS替代方案。

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing

*Yongbo Chen,Yanhao Zhang,Shaifali Parashar,Liang Zhao,Shoudong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Con-NRSfM的新方法，用于处理保形变形下的非刚性结构恢复问题，能够准确计算局部保形尺度并实现更精确的深度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的非刚性结构恢复方法依赖严格假设（如局部平面表面或局部线性变形），无法恢复保形尺度，且深度和保形尺度约束耦合在一起。

Method: 使用基于图的框架优化2D图像扭曲进行逐点重建，采用并行可分离迭代优化策略，并结合自监督学习的编码器-解码器网络生成带纹理的密集3D点云。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的仿真和实验结果表明，该方法在重建精度和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Con-NRSfM方法消除了现有方法的限制，能够准确计算局部保形尺度，实现更精确的深度估计，并在重建性能上表现出色。

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

*Jin Cao,Hongrui Wu,Ziyong Feng,Hujun Bao,Xiaowei Zhou,Sida Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVerse框架将鲁棒3D重建分解为修复和重建两个子任务，通过视频扩散模型处理不一致的多视角图像，实现更好的泛化能力和场景风格控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从不一致多视角图像进行3D重建的挑战，现有方法依赖密集观测且优化困难，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出UniVerse统一框架：先将不一致图像转换为初始视频，使用专门设计的视频扩散模型修复为一致图像，最后从修复图像重建3D场景。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法具有强大的泛化能力和优越的鲁棒重建性能，并能控制重建3D场景的风格。

Conclusion: UniVerse通过解耦修复和重建任务，利用扩散模型学习的大规模场景先验，有效处理多样化的图像不一致问题，优于逐视图退化建模方法。

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

### [29] [An Efficient Deep Template Matching and In-Plane Pose Estimation Method via Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01678)
*Ke Jia,Ji Zhou,Hanxin Li,Zhigan Zhou,Haojie Chu,Xiaojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出轻量级端到端模板匹配框架PoseMatch-TDCM，将模板匹配重新定义为联合定位和几何回归问题，输出中心坐标、旋转角度和独立缩放比例，在复杂背景下实现高效目标姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模板匹配方法在复合变换下效率低下，而大多数基于深度学习的方法仅估计相似度分数，无法显式建模几何姿态，难以在实际工业场景中部署。

Method: 使用模板感知动态卷积模块动态注入模板特征，结合深度可分离卷积和像素洗牌实现高效匹配；采用旋转-剪切增强策略进行无几何标注训练；通过轻量级细化模块提升角度和尺度精度。

Result: 3.07M参数的模型在复合变换下达到高精度和14ms推理速度，在小模板和多目标场景中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法非常适合实时工业应用部署，在复杂背景下实现了高效准确的模板匹配和姿态估计。

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

### [30] [Look Less, Reason More: Rollout-Guided Adaptive Pixel-Space Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01681)
*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Jiahui Gao,Renjie Pi,Shiyu Hu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个自适应像素推理框架，通过动态确定必要的像素级操作来提升视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉任务中的性能，同时减少不必要的视觉操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理需要精确理解细粒度视觉元素的任务时经常遇到困难，主要原因是图像编码过程中的信息丢失或对关键区域关注不足。现有方法虽然通过引入像素级视觉信息改善了推理过程，但往往过度使用这些信息，导致效率低下和无关视觉细节的干扰。

Method: 首先应用操作感知的监督微调建立文本推理和视觉操作的基础能力，然后设计新颖的rollout引导强化学习框架，依靠模型自身响应的反馈来使视觉语言模型能够根据查询难度动态决定何时调用像素操作。

Result: 在广泛的多模态推理基准测试中，模型实现了优越性能，同时显著减少了不必要的视觉操作。在HR-Bench 4K上达到73.4%的准确率，工具使用率仅为20.1%，相比先前方法在提高准确率的同时将工具使用率降低了66.5%。

Conclusion: 该自适应像素推理框架有效解决了视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉任务中的挑战，通过动态调整像素级操作的使用，在保持高性能的同时大幅提升了效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了基于增强敏感性的风险评分框架ASRS，通过测量放射图像在旋转增强后的嵌入变化来识别易出错病例，提高医疗AI的公平性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光片解读中表现良好，但在患者亚组间存在准确性不均的问题，现有错误检测方法难以处理分布内的细微错误。

Method: 使用临床合理的旋转增强（±15°/±30°），通过RAD-DINO编码器测量嵌入变化，计算敏感性分数对样本进行稳定性分层。

Result: 高敏感性病例的召回率显著降低（-0.2到-0.3），尽管AUROC和置信度很高，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ASRS提供了一种无需标签的选择性预测和临床医生审查方法，能够改善医疗AI的公平性和安全性。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeViS是一个免训练的视频风格化框架，通过整合多个风格化参考到预训练的图像转视频模型，生成具有丰富风格细节和强时序一致性的风格化视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频风格化方法存在时序一致性差、风格丰富度不足的问题，而训练专门的视频风格化模型需要配对视频数据且计算成本高昂。

Method: 整合多个风格化参考到预训练I2V模型，使用高频补偿约束内容布局和运动，结合基于光流的运动线索保留低显著性区域的风格纹理。

Result: FreeViS在风格化保真度和时序一致性方面表现优异，优于现有基线方法并获得强烈的人类偏好。

Conclusion: FreeViS提供了一个实用且经济的解决方案，能够实现高质量、时序一致的视频风格化，无需训练过程。

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

TL;DR: 提出了MedQ-Bench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在医学图像质量评估中的感知和推理能力，包含2600个感知查询和708个推理评估，涵盖5种成像模态和40多个质量属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像质量评估方法受限于标量评分指标，无法反映专家评估中的人类推理过程，需要建立更符合人类推理的评估范式。

Method: 设计了MedQ-Perception和MedQ-Reasoning两个互补任务，前者评估低层感知能力，后者评估无参考和比较推理能力，并提出了四维评判协议。

Result: 评估了14个最先进的MLLM，发现模型显示出初步但不稳定的感知和推理技能，临床应用的准确性不足。

Conclusion: MLLM在医学图像质量评估中需要针对性优化，MedQ-Bench将推动该领域的进一步探索。

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaFormer是一个能够通过单次前向传播从RGB图像中预测完整遮挡和深度排序的网络，无需昂贵的输入格式（如类别标签、分割掩码）和二次方的前向传播成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在受控环境中，理解实例级别的几何关系对于多种视觉模型仍具挑战性。现有方法依赖昂贵的输入格式和推理成本，限制了其应用。

Method: InstaFormer利用对象查询和潜在掩码描述符之间的交互，这些描述符语义上表示相同对象但携带互补信息，从而实现整体顺序预测。

Result: 通过全面基准测试和消融实验，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: InstaFormer能够仅通过输入RGB图像，在单次前向传播中返回场景中所有实例的完整遮挡和深度排序，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this
URL: https://github.com/SNU-VGILab/InstaOrder.

TL;DR: PyramidStyler是一个基于Transformer的神经风格迁移框架，采用金字塔位置编码和强化学习优化，在保持实时推理速度的同时显著降低了内容和风格损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN和Transformer模型在处理复杂风格和高分辨率输入时存在效率问题，需要一种既能捕捉局部细节又能理解全局上下文的高效方法。

Method: 提出PyramidStyler框架，使用金字塔位置编码实现多尺度特征捕捉，并结合强化学习动态优化风格化过程以加速收敛。

Result: 在4000轮训练后，内容损失降低62.6%至2.07，风格损失降低57.4%至0.86，推理时间1.39秒；使用RL后进一步改善至内容损失2.03，风格损失0.75，推理时间1.40秒。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了实时高质量的艺术渲染，在媒体和设计领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media
and design.

TL;DR: LoBE-GS是一个负载均衡的高效3D高斯溅射框架，解决了大规模场景重建中的负载不平衡问题，实现了2倍训练速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分治方法在大规模无边界场景（如城市街区）中存在负载不平衡和粗到细管道效率低下的问题。

Method: 引入深度感知分区方法、基于优化的负载均衡策略，以及可见性裁剪和选择性致密化两种轻量级技术。

Result: 在大规模城市和户外数据集上，LoBE-GS实现了比现有方法快2倍的端到端训练时间，同时保持重建质量。

Conclusion: LoBE-GS能够扩展到传统3DGS无法处理的场景，为大规模3D场景重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

TL;DR: 提出了MemoryPack和Direct Forcing两个创新方法，分别解决长视频生成中的长期依赖建模和错误累积问题，显著提升了自回归视频模型的上下文一致性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成面临双重挑战：需要捕捉长期依赖关系，同时防止自回归解码中固有的错误累积。

Method: 1. MemoryPack：可学习的上下文检索机制，利用文本和图像信息作为全局指导，联合建模短期和长期依赖关系；2. Direct Forcing：高效的单步近似策略，改善训练-推理对齐，减少推理过程中的错误传播。

Result: 实现了分钟级的时间一致性，计算效率高且保持线性复杂度，显著提升了长视频生成的上下文一致性和可靠性。

Conclusion: MemoryPack和Direct Forcing的结合显著增强了自回归视频模型在长视频生成中的实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶系统中，精确的目标检测和不确定性估计对于自主感知和安全运行至关重要，需要解决3D目标检测器分类任务的置信度校准问题。

Method: 提出了两种辅助正则化损失项：一种校准主导预测，另一种校准完整预测向量；评估了多种后处理和训练时方法，结合完整类别预测校准损失和等渗回归。

Result: 在CenterPoint和PillarNet模型上，结合完整类别预测校准损失和等渗回归的方法实现了主导和次要类别预测的最佳校准；但DSVT-Pillar无法使用相同方法同时校准主导和次要预测。

Conclusion: 完整预测分布校准对于3D目标检测器很重要，提出的方法在多个模型上有效，但不同模型可能需要不同的校准策略。

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有人员搜索方法使用ImageNet预训练骨干网络，可能无法有效捕捉复杂空间上下文和细粒度身份线索，且共享骨干网络导致检测和重识别任务之间存在优化冲突。

Method: 提出DiffPS框架，包含三个模块：扩散引导区域提议网络(DGRPN)用于改进人员定位，多尺度频率细化网络(MSFRN)缓解形状偏差，语义自适应特征聚合网络(SFAN)利用文本对齐的扩散特征。

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 扩散先验知识可以有效解决人员搜索中检测和重识别任务的优化冲突，提升整体性能。

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像成本高且重建困难，现有压缩感知系统如CASSI虽提高效率，但仍面临严重退化问题，难以恢复精细光谱细节。

Method: 将流匹配嵌入深度展开框架，引入平均速度损失来增强流动力学一致性，结合基于优化的可解释性和流匹配的生成能力。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，FMU在重建质量上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMU成功将流匹配与深度展开相结合，为HSI重建提供了更鲁棒和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的DIP元件自动缺陷检测系统，使用ConSinGAN生成缺陷图像解决数据不足问题，YOLOv7+ConSinGAN组合在准确率和检测时间上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业元件缺陷检测耗时费力，给质检人员带来沉重负担且难以管理产品质量，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用数字相机光学系统和深度学习模型，针对DIP元件的表面缺陷和引脚缺陷，采用ConSinGAN生成训练数据集，比较YOLOv3/v4/v7/v9四种模型性能。

Result: YOLOv7+ConSinGAN组合达到95.50%准确率，检测时间285毫秒，远优于基于阈值的方法，并开发了SCADA系统和相关传感器架构。

Conclusion: 所提出的自动缺陷检测方法易于建立，可适用于多种缺陷类型或缺陷数据不足的情况。

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FoundAD方法，利用基础视觉编码器学习非线性投影算子，通过嵌入差异检测图像中的异常区域，在少样本异常检测中实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本异常检测在工业安全检查中很重要，但有限样本使得正常与异常特征区分困难，特别是在类别不可知条件下。基础视觉编码器的大规模预训练有助于学习正常图像的一般分布。

Method: 利用基础视觉编码器学习非线性投影算子到自然图像流形上，通过嵌入差异来表征和识别图像中的分布外区域。

Result: 实验表明该方法支持多类检测，在使用更少参数的情况下达到竞争性性能，并在多个基础编码器（包括DINOv3）上验证有效。

Conclusion: 该方法拓宽了基础特征的应用视角，推动了少样本异常检测领域的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

TL;DR: ClustViT通过可训练的聚类模块和再生器模块优化Vision Transformer，在语义分割任务中显著降低计算复杂度，同时保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer在真实机器人系统中应用受限，因其二次注意力复杂度。现有token合并方法适合分类但不适合密集预测任务。

Method: 扩展ViT架构，加入可训练的聚类模块根据分割掩码的伪聚类合并相似token，再通过再生器模块恢复细节信息。

Result: 在三个数据集上实现2.18倍GFLOPs减少和1.64倍推理加速，分割精度相当。

Conclusion: ClustViT有效降低了ViT在密集预测任务中的计算复杂度，提升了实际应用可行性。

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

TL;DR: PaDT是一种统一的多模态大语言模型范式，通过视觉参考令牌直接生成文本和多样化视觉输出，在视觉感知任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法依赖间接表示（如将坐标生成为文本），限制了性能并阻碍了密集预测任务如分割。

Method: 提出Patch-as-Decodable Token范式，使用视觉参考令牌与文本令牌交错，轻量解码器将LLM输出转换为检测、分割和定位预测。

Result: 在四个视觉感知和理解任务中持续达到最先进性能，甚至优于显著更大的MLLM模型。

Conclusion: PaDT为MLLM提供了一种直接生成多样化视觉输出的有效方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

TL;DR: 本文提出TriAlignXA可解释AI框架，通过三重优化引擎解决农产品电商中的'信任三角'问题，将算法角色从决策者转变为透明决策依据提供者，显著提升分级准确性和消费者信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线生鲜电商存在'信任赤字'，主要源于数字交易无法提供直接的产品质量感官感知。传统绝对分级标准存在生物特性、时效性和经济可行性之间的'不可能三角'限制。

Method: 构建'信任金字塔'模型，提出'三角信任指数'(TTI)量化权衡，设计TriAlignXA可解释AI框架，包含生物自适应引擎、时效优化引擎和经济优化引擎，并采用'预映射机制'将过程数据编码为二维码。

Result: 分级任务实验显示准确率显著高于基线模型，实证和理论分析验证了框架在解决'不可能三角'方面的平衡能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建可信赖的在线农产品生态系统提供了从理论到实践的全面支持，建立了从算法决策到消费者信任的关键路径。

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

TL;DR: 提出了4DGS-Craft框架，通过4D感知的InstructPix2Pix模型、多视图网格模块和Gaussian选择机制，解决了4D高斯溅射编辑中的视图、时间和非编辑区域一致性问题，并利用LLM模块理解用户意图，实现更一致和可控的4D场景编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的4D高斯溅射编辑方法在视图一致性、时间一致性、非编辑区域保持以及处理复杂文本指令方面面临挑战，需要开发更一致和交互式的编辑框架。

Method: 1) 引入4D感知的InstructPix2Pix模型，集成4D VGGT几何特征；2) 使用多视图网格模块迭代优化多视图输入图像；3) 提出Gaussian选择机制仅优化编辑区域的Gaussian；4) 设计基于LLM的用户意图理解模块，将复杂指令分解为原子操作序列。

Result: 相比现有方法，该框架能够实现更一致和可控的4D场景编辑，在视图、时间和非编辑区域保持方面表现更好，并能处理复杂的用户指令。

Conclusion: 4DGS-Craft通过结合4D感知编辑模型、一致性保持机制和智能用户交互模块，有效解决了4D高斯溅射编辑中的关键挑战，为4D场景编辑提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Pure-Pass (PP)像素级掩码机制，通过固定颜色中心点分类像素，免除纯像素的昂贵计算，集成到ATD-light模型中实现高效超分辨率重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级超分辨率方法如CAMixer存在适应性差、掩码粒度粗和空间灵活性不足等问题，需要更精细的计算优化机制。

Method: Pure-Pass机制利用固定颜色中心点将像素分类为不同类别，识别纯像素并免除其昂贵计算，实现像素级精细掩码。

Result: PP-ATD-light在节省相似计算量的情况下，在重建质量和参数效率方面均优于CAMixer-ATD-light。

Conclusion: Pure-Pass机制通过像素级精细掩码实现了高效超分辨率重建，在保持自适应灵活性的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

TL;DR: 使用GPT-4o多模态能力自动生成颌骨囊肿的牙科全景X光片发现，通过自校正循环与结构化输出(SLSO)框架提高准确性，在22个病例中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用多模态AI模型自动生成牙科影像发现，提高诊断效率和准确性，减少人工分析的工作量。

Method: 构建SLSO框架，包含10步流程：图像输入分析、结构化数据生成、牙号提取与一致性检查、检测到不一致时的迭代再生、发现生成与后续重构和一致性验证。与传统的思维链(CoT)方法进行比较。

Result: SLSO框架在多个评估项目上提高了输出准确性，牙号、牙齿移动和牙根吸收的改善率分别为66.9%、33.3%和28.6%。成功案例中经过最多5次再生后实现了结构一致的输出。

Conclusion: SLSO框架能够强制执行阴性发现描述、抑制幻觉并提高牙号识别准确性，但识别跨越多颗牙齿的广泛病变仍有限制，需要进一步改进以实现实用的发现生成系统。

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to
automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To
improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output
(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding
generation system.

Result: 模型能够准确重建原始点云，在保持性能的同时提高重建质量，并展现出对非交通环境对象的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LiLa-Net在资源受限条件下实现了高效的点云特征提取和重建，具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which
encodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the
LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle,
equipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to
improve the performance without using extensive resources as the
state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of
encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an
efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately
reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has
been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the
latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without
compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original
traffic environment.

Conclusion: kabr-tools为生态系统范围研究提供了强大的自动行为监测工具，推进了保护、生物多样性研究和生态监测。

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖点云或需要预定义同胚映射来处理无纹理数据，存在局限性。本文旨在克服这些限制，实现语义感知的3D形状和纹理变形。

Method: 使用网格引导的3D高斯泼溅进行高保真建模，采用统一变形策略将3D高斯锚定到重建的网格面片上，通过拓扑感知约束保持纹理保真度，并利用网格拓扑作为几何先验建立无监督语义对应。

Result: 在TexMorph基准测试中，GaussianMorphing显著优于先前的2D/3D方法，颜色一致性误差(ΔE)降低了22.2%，EI降低了26.2%。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在不需要标注数据的情况下，在整个变形过程中保持局部细节和全局语义一致性，为3D形状和纹理变形提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

Motivation: 现有基于条件扩散模型的方法因位置测量受用户体型影响较大，难以跨用户泛化。

Method: 将姿态估计建模为逆问题，使用预训练扩散模型仅以旋转测量为条件，通过似然项引导生成与测量位置一致的姿态序列。

Result: 提出的InPose方法能够零样本泛化到不同用户，生成与稀疏体表测量一致的高概率姿态序列。

Conclusion: 通过分离旋转条件和位置引导，InPose解决了跨用户泛化问题，为有限传感器下的姿态估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

Motivation: 传统卷积架构如U-Net在捕捉长距离依赖关系方面能力有限，限制了在复杂肿瘤结构上的性能。扩散模型在生成高保真医学图像和细化分割边界方面显示出强大潜力

Method: 在扩散过程核心嵌入视觉Transformer，利用全局上下文推理和迭代去噪来增强体积精度和边界精度。Transformer主干能够更有效地建模整个MRI体积的空间关系，而扩散细化则减轻体素级误差并恢复细粒度肿瘤细节

Conclusion: 这种混合设计为神经肿瘤学提供了改进鲁棒性和可扩展性的途径，超越了传统的U-Net基线，展示了Transformer引导的扩散模型在推进肿瘤分割技术前沿方面的潜力

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

Conclusion: 成功创建了首个开放获取的全国尺度历史城市足迹数据集，为长期城市化动态研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

TL;DR: 系统分析腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中点追踪的失败模式，发现点追踪对于手术工具具有竞争力，但对于解剖目标表现不佳，主要由于组织相似性和边界模糊导致失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解点追踪在复杂手术环境中的可靠性和失败情况，特别是与分割掩码初始化相比的性能差异。

Method: 在腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中，针对胆囊、抓钳和L型电钩三个手术目标，系统比较点追踪与分割掩码初始化的性能。

Result: 点追踪对于手术工具具有竞争力，但对于解剖目标表现不佳，主要由于组织相似性和边界模糊导致失败。

Conclusion: 通过定性分析揭示了影响追踪结果的关键因素，并提供了选择与放置追踪点的可操作建议，以改善手术视频分析性能。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot
tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the
available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost
alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical
environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze
the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

TL;DR: 提出FRIEREN框架解决联邦学习中的语义分割跨域问题，利用视觉基础模型和语言模态，在客户端仅使用未标记数据训练，无需重新访问源数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中语义分割任务面临的域偏移挑战，特别是在客户端数据未标记的情况下，现有方法要么不切实际地假设客户端有标记数据，要么未能充分利用现代视觉基础模型的能力。

Method: 使用视觉-语言解码器，基于CLIP文本嵌入进行语义消歧，采用弱到强一致性学习策略在伪标签上进行鲁棒的本地训练。

Result: 在合成到真实和清晰到恶劣天气基准测试中，框架有效解决了新任务，与现有域泛化和适应方法相比具有竞争力表现。

Conclusion: FRIEREN框架为联邦学习中的语义分割跨域问题提供了有效解决方案，为未来研究建立了强基线。

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASK-Hint是一个用于视频异常检测的结构化提示框架，通过动作中心知识引导冻结的视觉语言模型进行更准确和可解释的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示方法过于抽象，忽略了定义复杂异常所需的细粒度人-物交互或动作语义，需要更精细的提示策略。

Method: 将提示组织成语义连贯的组别（如暴力、财产犯罪、公共安全），并制定细粒度的引导问题，使模型预测与判别性视觉线索对齐。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上的实验显示，ASK-Hint持续提升AUC，相比微调和免训练方法都达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架强调了提示粒度的重要性，为可解释的视频异常检测提供了一个免训练且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language
models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are
often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions
or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We
propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages
action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning
from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoPurify通过学生亲和网络和几何引导池化模块，利用3D自监督教师模型中的几何先验来纯化2D VLM生成的3D点特征，有效解决了2D到3D特征转移中的噪声和几何不一致问题，仅需1.5%的训练数据即可达到或超越最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的2D视觉语言模型特征转移到3D语义分割存在权衡：直接投影产生噪声预测，而强制几何一致性需要昂贵的训练流程和大规模标注数据。作者认为这种限制源于分割-匹配范式未能协调2D语义与3D几何结构。

Method: 提出GeoPurify方法：1）使用小型学生亲和网络，利用3D自监督教师模型提取的几何先验来纯化2D VLM生成的3D点特征；2）在推理时设计几何引导池化模块进一步去噪点云并确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 在主要3D基准测试上的广泛实验表明，GeoPurify仅使用约1.5%的训练数据即可达到或超越最先进性能。

Conclusion: GeoPurify通过利用潜在几何信息和学习的亲和网络，有效缓解了2D到3D特征转移中的权衡问题，实现了卓越的数据效率。

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: 提出一种基于猪耳静脉模式的非侵入性生物识别方法，使用标准智能手机和简单背光采集图像，通过多阶段计算机视觉流程提取特征，SVM模型在混合品种猪群中达到98.12%的识别精度，平均处理时间8.3秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统猪只识别方法（耳标、芯片）不可靠、成本高且主要针对纯种猪，对小规模农户不实用，需要开发低成本、非侵入性的替代方案。

Method: 收集20头混合品种猪的800张耳部图像，开发多阶段计算机视觉流程增强静脉可见性，提取结构和空间特征生成生物特征签名，使用机器学习模型进行分类。

Result: 支持向量机（SVM）在混合品种猪群中达到98.12%的识别精度，从图像处理到分类的整个过程平均耗时8.3秒。

Conclusion: 该系统通过用永久性生物标记替代易损的物理标识，为农民提供了经济高效且无压力的动物识别方法，证实了耳静脉生物识别技术在数字化畜牧管理中的实用性。

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

Motivation: 解决密集和遮挡场景中传统检测计数方法失效的问题，需要开发能够处理多类别计数的密度图估计方法。

Method: 使用Twins金字塔视觉Transformer骨干网络，构建专门的多类别计数头，采用多尺度解码方法，并添加基于分割的类别聚焦模块来抑制训练时的类别间干扰。

Result: 在VisDrone和iSAID基准测试中表现优于现有多类别人群计数方法，MAE分别降低了33%、43%和64%，并在生物多样性监测数据集上验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为多类别人群计数开辟了新领域，能够为保护工作和可扩展的生态洞察提供支持，证明了在密集场景中人群计数方法的必要性。

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable
ecological insights.

TL;DR: TempoControl是一种无需重新训练或额外监督的方法，通过优化交叉注意力图来实现视频生成中的时间对齐控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成视频模型缺乏细粒度的时间控制，无法让用户指定特定视觉元素在生成序列中出现的时间。

Method: 利用文本到视频扩散模型中的交叉注意力图，通过相关性、能量和熵三个互补原则来引导概念的时间安排。

Result: 该方法能够在保持高质量和多样性的同时，实现对时间安排的精确控制，适用于多种视频生成应用。

Conclusion: TempoControl提供了一种有效的时间对齐解决方案，增强了生成视频模型的时间控制能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

TL;DR: 提出了RewardMap框架，通过多阶段强化学习和难度感知奖励设计，解决了多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉推理任务中的稀疏奖励和不稳定优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在结构化信息丰富的场景（如交通地图）中的空间推理能力不足，标准RL方法因稀疏奖励和优化不稳定而受阻。

Method: 构建ReasonMap-Plus数据集提供密集奖励信号；提出RewardMap框架，包含难度感知奖励设计和多阶段RL方案，从简单感知任务逐步训练到复杂推理任务。

Result: 在ReasonMap和ReasonMap-Plus上的实验显示RewardMap各组件均带来性能提升，组合使用效果最佳；在6个基准测试中平均提升3.47%。

Conclusion: RewardMap有效提升了MLLMs的视觉理解和推理能力，特别是在细粒度视觉推理任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: DragFlow是首个有效利用FLUX强大先验进行拖拽式图像编辑的框架，通过区域级编辑范式、仿射变换和IP-Adapter等技术，显著提升了编辑质量，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型从UNet-based DDPMs转向更可扩展的DiT with flow matching（如SD3.5、FLUX），生成先验显著增强，但拖拽式编辑尚未从中受益。现有方法在目标区域存在严重失真问题。

Method: 提出区域级编辑范式，使用仿射变换提供更丰富一致的特征监督；集成预训练开放域个性化适配器（IP-Adapter）增强主体一致性；采用梯度掩码硬约束保护背景保真度；利用多模态大语言模型解决任务歧义。

Result: 在DragBench-DR和ReD Bench上的大量实验表明，DragFlow超越了基于点和基于区域的基线方法，在拖拽式图像编辑中达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DragFlow成功利用FLUX的强大先验，通过区域级编辑解决了传统点级拖拽编辑的失真问题，为拖拽式图像编辑设定了新的技术标准。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出了F2C方法，通过选择关键片段而非单帧来保持视频的时间连贯性，同时使用自适应分辨率策略在固定计算预算下平衡空间分辨率和片段长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型面临'大海捞针'问题：原始视频帧产生的大量视觉标记耗尽模型上下文窗口。现有解决方案通过选择稀疏帧集来减少标记数量，但这种逐帧选择丢弃了基本的时间动态，导致对运动和事件连续性的推理不理想。

Method: 提出F2C方法：1）从孤立关键帧扩展到关键片段（短时间连贯片段）；2）采用自适应分辨率策略，动态平衡空间分辨率和片段长度，确保每个视频的标记数量恒定。

Result: 在三个长视频基准测试中，F2C方法比均匀采样分别提升了8.1%（Video-MME）、5.6%（LongVideoBench）和10.3%（MLVU）。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在帧选择中保持时间连贯性的重要性，为将视频LLM扩展到实际视频理解应用提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

Conclusion: NeuroSwift提供了一种高效且准确的跨被试视觉刺激重建解决方案，显著降低了计算需求并提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在细粒度图像分类任务中表现受限，因为其依赖粗粒度的全局特征而忽略了微观局部线索。现有方法通过LLM描述对齐CLIP的[CLS]token，但缺乏空间精度。

Method: 提出Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling(SOAP)构建显著性引导的[FG]token，与全局[CLS]token融合实现粗细粒度对齐；使用双头LLM分类器（冻结和可学习）提供稳定文本先验；开发动态知识聚合结合固定先验和演化logits迭代优化伪标签。

Result: 在13个细粒度基准测试中平均获得2.90%的准确率提升，仅需轻量级适配。

Conclusion: microCLIP成功挖掘了CLIP中潜在的细粒度信号，通过联合优化视觉和文本表示，显著提升了细粒度分类性能，同时保持了轻量适配的特性。

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

TL;DR: VidGuard-R1是首个基于多模态大语言模型(MLLM)的视频真实性检测器，使用群体相对策略优化(GRPO)进行微调，能够提供高精度判断和可解释的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频技术的快速发展，需要有效的检测工具来减轻错误信息和声誉损害等社会风险，同时检测模型需要提供可解释的解释以确保监管机构和最终用户的透明度。

Method: 使用群体相对策略优化(GRPO)微调Qwen-VL多模态大语言模型，配备两个专门针对时间伪影和生成复杂度的奖励模型，构建了包含14万真实和AI生成视频的挑战性数据集。

Result: VidGuard-R1在现有基准测试中实现了最先进的零样本性能，额外训练后准确率超过95%，案例研究显示其能够产生精确且可解释的预测理由。

Conclusion: VidGuard-R1通过结合高精度检测和可解释推理，为AI生成视频检测提供了有效的解决方案，代码已公开可用。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need
for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation
and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential
that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency
for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce
VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies
further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales
behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单有效的方法来缓解长视频生成中的质量退化问题，无需长视频教师监督或长视频数据集重新训练。通过利用教师模型的丰富知识为自生成长视频中的采样片段提供指导，实现了20倍于教师能力的时间一致性视频扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像和视频生成方面取得了革命性进展，但基于transformer架构的计算成本过高，特别是在生成长视频时。现有自回归方法在超出训练范围时会出现明显的质量退化，这是由于连续潜在空间中误差的累积效应。

Method: 利用教师模型的丰富知识为自生成长视频中的采样片段提供指导，通过自我强制机制保持时间一致性，避免过度曝光和误差累积问题，无需重新计算重叠帧。

Result: 能够生成长达4分15秒的视频，相当于基础模型位置嵌入支持的最大跨度的99.9%，比基线模型长50倍以上。在标准基准测试和改进基准测试中，在保真度和一致性方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功缓解了长视频生成中的质量退化问题，实现了高质量的长视频生成，无需额外的长视频监督或重新训练。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

TL;DR: KineMask是一种物理引导的视频生成方法，通过两阶段训练策略和对象掩码，实现了对刚性物体的真实控制和交互，在合成场景和真实场景中都显著提升了物体交互的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在物理合理的物体交互方面仍存在困难，缺乏基于物理的控制机制。为了解决这一限制，需要开发能够实现真实刚性体控制、交互和效果的视频生成方法。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略，通过对象掩码逐步移除未来运动监督，在合成场景上训练视频扩散模型，并结合低级运动控制与高级文本条件化。

Result: 在合成场景和真实场景中，KineMask在物体交互方面相比同类规模的最新模型取得了显著改进，消融研究进一步验证了低级和高级条件化在视频扩散模型中的互补作用。

Conclusion: KineMask通过物理引导的视频生成方法，有效解决了当前模型在物理合理交互方面的局限性，为机器人学和具身决策提供了有前景的世界模拟器。

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

Motivation: 当前视频模型缺乏精细控制能力，无法作为世界模型使用。通用家用机器人需要实时精细运动控制来处理精细任务和紧急情况。

Method: 引入精细多模态动作，整合多种感官信息；开发特征学习范式对齐多模态同时保留各模态独特信息；提出正则化方案增强动作轨迹特征的因果性。

Conclusion: 多模态感官整合能够有效提升精细控制的模拟性能，为机器人精细操作提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

<details>

Motivation: 解决多模态语言模型在视频理解中因上下文长度限制而错过关键过渡帧、难以保持长时间连贯性的问题。

Method: 将原生稀疏注意力(NSA)适配到视频语言模型中，采用硬件感知的混合注意力方法：文本使用密集注意力，视频使用NSA，基于216K视频指令数据集进行端到端训练。

Result: 相比token压缩和无训练稀疏基线，VideoNSA在长视频理解、时序推理和空间基准测试中表现更好，可靠扩展到128K token，发现最优全局-局部注意力分配和任务依赖的分支使用模式。

Conclusion: VideoNSA通过可学习的组合稀疏注意力成功解决了长视频理解的挑战，能够诱导动态注意力汇聚点，为视频语言模型提供了有效的长上下文处理方案。

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context
length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain
coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts
Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We
employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense
attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to
token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention
allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)
the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

TL;DR: NoiseShift是一种无需训练的方法，通过重新校准去噪器的噪声水平来解决扩散模型在不同分辨率下的泛化问题，显著提升了低分辨率图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高分辨率文本到图像生成器无法为不需要高分辨率图像的用户提供开箱即用的经济高效替代方案，因为模型在训练分辨率之外的泛化能力较差。

Method: 提出NoiseShift方法，基于分辨率大小重新校准去噪器的噪声水平，无需改变模型架构或采样计划，与现有模型兼容。

Result: 在LAION-COCO数据集上，NoiseShift将SD3.5的FID提升15.89%，SD3提升8.56%，Flux-Dev提升2.44%；在CelebA数据集上，分别提升10.36%、5.19%和3.02%。

Conclusion: NoiseShift能有效缓解分辨率相关的伪影，提升低分辨率图像生成质量，为扩散模型提供更好的分辨率泛化能力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何从视频中推断需要时间信息才能判断的动态物理属性，如弹性、粘度和动态摩擦，以扩展计算机视觉在物理属性预测中的应用。

Method: 收集了三个物理属性的视频数据集；探索了三种推断方法：基于经典计算机视觉技术的oracle方法、使用视觉提示和可训练提示向量的简单读出机制、以及多模态大语言模型的提示策略。

Result: 生成式或自监督训练的视频基础模型性能相似，但落后于oracle方法；多模态大语言模型目前性能较差，但通过合适的提示可以改善。

Conclusion: 视频基础模型在动态物理属性预测方面表现良好，但仍有改进空间；多模态大语言模型需要更好的提示策略来提升性能。

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More
specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information
to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,
and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make
the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Method: 开发自动管道计算物体分割掩码，引导模型关注交互中最具信息量的区域；使用槽注意力视觉编码器增强对象先验。

Result: 在新任务和现有多模态动作理解任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的对象感知框架能有效链接声音与相关物体，提升多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor
versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to
the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to
evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly
involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework
learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric
approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks
of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the
most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is
used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art
performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding
tasks.

Method: 提出密度引导投毒方法，使用核密度估计（KDE）识别低密度区域，在这些区域战略性地注入高斯点来嵌入视角依赖的虚幻物体。同时引入自适应噪声策略破坏多视角一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在攻击效果上优于现有最先进技术，能够有效嵌入明显可见的虚幻物体，同时保持对其他视角的最小影响。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了3DGS对投毒攻击的脆弱性，提出的密度引导投毒方法和KDE评估协议为未来研究提供了客观基准，强调了3D场景表示方法安全性研究的重要性。

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes
critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and
propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: 文本到图像模型在单主体提示上表现优秀，但在多主体描述中经常出现属性泄漏、身份纠缠和主体遗漏等问题，需要专门的方法来提升多主体生成质量。

Method: 将流匹配通过随机最优控制视角重新表述，开发了两种架构无关的算法：无需训练的单次更新测试时控制器，以及轻量级微调方法Adjoint Matching。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3.5、FLUX和Stable Diffusion XL等模型上，两种算法都显著提升了多主体对齐效果，同时保持了基础模型的风格。测试时控制可在普通GPU上高效运行，微调控制器在有限提示上训练后能泛化到未见过的提示。

Conclusion: FOCUS方法在多主体保真度方面达到了最先进的性能，为多主体文本到图像生成提供了统一的理论框架和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with
multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity
entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical
framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

*Zarreen Reza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个使用多智能体辩论作为评估框架的新方法，用于量化LLM智能体在交互环境中表现出的社会认知行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估基准无法捕捉LLM智能体在交互环境中表现出的社会认知动态，需要新的评估方法来理解智能体的社会行为。

Method: 使用具有不同角色和激励的LLM智能体在LLM主持人的监督下进行辩论，通过新的心理测量和语义指标进行分析。

Result: 发现智能体有强烈的共识寻求倾向，角色分配能产生稳定的心理测量特征，主持人的角色能显著改变辩论结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为面向智能体场景的动态、基于心理测量的评估协议提供了蓝图，对于理解和塑造下一代AI智能体的社会行为至关重要。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

TL;DR: AGILE通过将拼图任务建模为交互式过程，使用代码执行动作并接收视觉反馈，显著提升了视觉语言模型的感知和推理能力，在拼图任务上准确率从9.5%提升到82.8%，并在9个通用视觉任务上平均提升3.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在多模态理解和推理方面虽有进步，但其基本感知和推理能力仍然有限，即使在简单拼图任务上表现也接近随机水平。高质量视觉语言数据的稀缺性和有限可扩展性限制了模型能力的提升。

Method: 提出AGILE方法，将拼图解决建模为交互过程，模型在每个步骤生成可执行代码来执行动作，环境提供细粒度视觉反馈来指导任务完成。通过观察和交互的迭代循环，模型通过探索和反馈逐步提升感知和推理能力。

Result: AGILE在复杂度不同的拼图任务上显著提升性能（在2×2设置下准确率从9.5%提升到82.8%），并在9个通用视觉任务上表现出强泛化能力，平均提升3.1%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进多模态模型的推理和泛化能力开辟了新途径，并为多模态强化学习数据稀缺问题提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

TL;DR: MEMTRACK是一个评估多平台智能体环境中长期记忆和状态跟踪的基准测试，专注于企业环境中的动态记忆评估，而不仅仅是对话场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文和记忆基准测试主要关注对话实例，但企业环境中动态记忆评估的需求对于其有效应用至关重要。

Method: 通过整合Slack、Linear和Git等多个通信和生产力平台的异步事件，模拟现实的组织工作流程，创建平台交错的时间线，包含嘈杂、冲突、交叉引用的信息。

Result: 实验显示，即使是性能最好的GPT-5模型在MEMTRACK上的正确性得分也只有60%，表明在长时程记忆利用、跨平台依赖处理和矛盾解决方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: 这项工作为记忆增强智能体的评估研究提供了一个可扩展的框架，超越了现有对话设置的局限，为复杂组织环境中的多智能体、多平台记忆基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策复杂性增加和电子健康记录快速扩展带来了数据驱动医疗的机会与挑战，需要开发能够辅助处方决策的智能系统。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)管道，整合自然语言处理和结构化临床输入，通过分析患者人口统计、临床表现、诊断信息和治疗历史等数据，检索类似病例并生成治疗建议。

Result: 初步评估使用去标识化和合成临床数据集，结果显示模型输出具有临床合理性和一致性，表明LLM工具在适当约束和严格验证下可为处方工作流程提供有价值的决策支持。

Conclusion: 这是将生成式AI整合到真实世界临床决策中的初步尝试，强调透明度、安全性以及与既定实践的一致性。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRACE方法检测隐式奖励攻击，通过截断推理链测量验证通过率来量化模型努力程度，在数学推理和编程任务中显著优于现有CoT监控方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励攻击（模型利用奖励函数漏洞获得高分但不解决实际任务）是一个严重威胁，特别是隐式攻击会绕过现有的推理链监控。

Method: TRACE方法逐步截断模型的推理链，强制模型回答，测量不同截断长度下的验证通过率。攻击模型会因走捷径而在推理链很短时就获得高通过率。

Result: 在数学推理任务中比最强的72B CoT监控提升65%以上，在编程任务中比32B监控提升30%以上，并能发现训练中的未知漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种可扩展的无监督监督方法，在当前监控方法无效的情况下有效检测隐式奖励攻击。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

*Humaid Ibrahim,Nikolai Rozanov,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种通过蒸馏将推理时检索转化为学习能力的方法，用提取的提示生成改进的教师轨迹，训练学生模型内部化这些能力，从而减少运行时依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在多步任务中经常因未满足前提条件、冗余命令或环境约束处理不当而失败。检索增强生成虽能改善性能，但需要维护外部知识库并增加计算开销。

Method: 三步流程：(1)从代理失败中提取紧凑可重用的提示；(2)使用这些提示在情节开始时通过一次性检索生成改进的教师轨迹；(3)在移除提示字符串的轨迹上训练学生模型，强制内部化而非记忆。

Result: 在ALFWorld和WebShop两个交互基准测试中，蒸馏学生模型始终优于基线代理，ALFWorld成功率91%（基线79%），WebShop得分72（基线61），同时比检索增强教师少用10-60%的token。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模（7B/14B参数）和代理架构（ReAct/StateAct）上均能泛化，证明检索优势可以通过针对性微调有效内部化，无需永久运行时依赖。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

Conclusion: LLM代理在自动化复杂工程建模任务方面具有巨大潜力，能显著减少人工工作量同时保持或超越现有预测性能标准

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

Motivation: 系统日志是重要的网络威胁情报来源，但由于缺乏结构、语义不一致和跨设备碎片化等问题，其利用价值受限。需要能够将噪声异构数据转化为连贯可互操作表示的方法。

Method: 集成轻量级日志本体与检索增强生成(RAG)和迭代校正步骤，确保生成的知识图谱在语法和语义上有效。系统还会将知识图谱聚合成会话，并使用LLM预测MITRE ATT&CK战术。

Result: 在公共基准和真实世界蜜罐数据集上的评估表明，OntoLogX能够在多个知识图谱后端上稳健生成图谱，并能准确将对抗活动映射到ATT&CK战术。检索和校正提高了精确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 代码导向模型在结构化日志分析中表现有效，基于本体的表示对于提取可操作的网络威胁情报具有重要价值。

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

Motivation: 解决大规模知识挖掘中LLM部署成本过高，而传统分类器-提取器管道虽然高效但脆弱且无法泛化到新任务的问题。

Method: 引入Falconer协作框架，LLM作为规划器分解用户指令为可执行管道，作为标注器生成监督数据训练小型代理模型，统一分类和提取为get label和get span两个原子操作。

Result: Falconer在指令遵循准确率上与最先进LLM相当，同时减少推理成本高达90%，加速大规模知识挖掘超过20倍。

Conclusion: Falconer为深度研究提供了高效且可扩展的基础，通过结合LLM的智能推理和轻量级代理模型，实现了成本效益和性能的平衡。

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

TL;DR: VOGUE通过将探索从文本空间转移到视觉空间，利用视觉不确定性引导探索，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在处理多模态输入时，将视觉输入视为固定条件，忽视了视觉变化的模糊性，导致策略对视觉变化不够鲁棒。

Method: VOGUE将图像视为随机上下文，通过计算原始分支和噪声分支之间的对称KL散度来量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，创建不确定性感知的探索信号。该方法结合不确定性比例奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样调度来平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B模型上，VOGUE在三个视觉数学基准上平均提升pass@1准确率2.6%，在三个通用领域推理基准上提升3.7%，同时提高了pass@4性能并缓解了RL微调中常见的探索衰减问题。

Conclusion: 基于视觉输入固有不确定性的探索策略是提升多模态推理的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

### [94] [Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts Surpasses ToT by Incorporating Logically-Consistent, Low-Utility Candidates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01500)
*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LToT是一种改进的思维树搜索控制器，通过分离效用和逻辑一致性，将低效用但一致的候选视为资产而非浪费，解决了广度饱和和深度近视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维树搜索在大计算预算下存在两个问题：广度饱和（额外样本产生近似重复）和深度近视（噪声短期效用过早剪枝有潜力的分支）。

Method: LToT将前沿分为主线（高效用候选用于开发）和侧线（一致但初始低效用候选），通过侧向竞速与短路机制探索侧线，使用有上限的连续减半竞赛和宽度感知阈值。

Result: 理论证明侧向成本为伪线性Θ(N₀ log_η N₀)，相比未加限制的主线指数增长显著更优。实证评估正在进行中。

Conclusion: LToT将大测试时预算转化为有原则的多样性，同时保持提升纪律，在不增加计算的情况下缓解饱和和近视问题。

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型在数学推理任务中的内部表示机制，通过分析标记的转移模式来理解推理过程，并寻求在生成过程中平衡利用已知推理路径和探索新路径的策略。

Method: 训练稀疏自编码器生成稀疏向量表示，应用k-means聚类构建标记转移图，定义基于边权重的奖励函数量化推理轨迹的遵循程度，同时通过聚类多样性评估探索程度。

Result: 研究发现平衡利用和探索对于数学推理任务的高准确性至关重要，稀疏自编码器可作为可扩展的奖励模型指导生成过程，避免极端行为。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效分析大语言模型的内部推理机制，通过平衡利用和探索策略提升数学推理任务的质量，稀疏自编码器可作为实用的奖励模型指导生成过程。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOGicalThought (LogT) 是一种新颖的神经符号架构，结合高级逻辑语言和推理器与LLM，通过构建双重符号图上下文和逻辑上下文，将长文本指南推理转化为紧凑的接地评估，在四个多领域基准测试中性能提升11.84%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域如法律和医学中，高保证推理需要准确、可验证且明确基于证据的结论。这些推理依赖于从规则、法规和合同中编码的前提，由于存在大量例外情况，涉及可废止或非单调逻辑，单个事实的引入可能使一般规则失效，带来重大挑战。LLM虽然在自然语言处理方面表现出色，但其在标准推理任务中的能力无法转化为对高保证文本指南所需的严格推理。

Method: 提出LOGicalThought (LogT) 神经符号架构，使用高级逻辑语言和推理器与LLM结合，构建双重符号图上下文和逻辑上下文表示，将长文本指南推理问题转化为紧凑的接地评估。

Result: 在四个多领域基准测试中与四个基线模型对比，LogT在所有LLM上的整体性能提高了11.84%。在三种推理模式上性能显著提升：否定推理提升高达+10.2%，蕴含推理提升+13.2%，可废止推理提升+5.5%。

Conclusion: LogT通过神经符号方法有效解决了高保证文本指南中的严格推理挑战，特别是在处理否定、蕴含和可废止规则等复杂逻辑结构方面表现出显著优势。

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: InfoSeeker是一个LLM决策框架，通过集成任务导向规划和信息寻求来在部分可观测环境中优化决策，在不确定性和环境动态变化下实现74%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划代理在处理观测不确定性时，往往忽略其内部动态与实际环境之间的差异，导致在信息不完整和噪声动态的实际环境中决策效果不佳。

Method: 提出InfoSeeker框架，提示LLM主动收集信息，通过规划行动来验证理解、检测环境变化或测试假设，然后生成或修订任务导向计划。

Result: 在部分可观测环境基准测试中，InfoSeeker比先前方法实现74%的绝对性能提升，且不牺牲样本效率，在机器人操作和网络导航等基准测试中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 在部分可观测环境中，紧密集成规划和信息寻求对于实现鲁棒行为至关重要，InfoSeeker证明了这种集成方法的有效性。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

TL;DR: 提出SAPO算法，通过过程奖励函数引导扩散语言模型学习结构化推理路径，解决现有方法中推理步骤无意义的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习方法依赖稀疏的结果奖励，会强化导致偶然正确结果的错误推理路径，这与推理的自然结构不匹配

Method: 提出理论框架将复杂问题解决形式化为层次选择过程，并基于此设计SAPO算法，使用过程奖励函数鼓励逐步进展

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在挑战性推理基准上显著提升性能，并增强生成过程的可解释性

Conclusion: SAPO通过将去噪过程与潜在推理层次对齐，有效改善了扩散语言模型的复杂推理能力

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

TL;DR: InvThink是一种让大语言模型具备逆向思维能力的方法，通过先分析潜在危害及其后果，再生成安全回答来提升模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法直接优化安全响应，但缺乏对潜在风险的系统性分析。InvThink旨在让模型在生成回答前先思考失败模式，从而更主动地避免风险。

Method: 1) 列举潜在危害 2) 分析后果 3) 生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出。通过监督微调和强化学习在三个LLM系列中实现。

Result: 安全改进随模型规模扩展更强；减轻安全税，保持标准基准上的通用推理能力；在高风险领域（医疗、金融、法律等）比SafetyPrompt基线减少15.7%有害响应。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了可扩展和泛化的路径。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

TL;DR: AdvEvo-MARL是一个协同进化的多智能体强化学习框架，通过内部化安全机制到任务智能体中，无需外部防护模块即可同时提升安全性和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM多智能体系统防御方法存在两个问题：自我验证能力不足，无法检测跨智能体的不安全链和委托风险；外部防护模块增加系统开销且存在单点故障风险。

Method: 采用对抗性学习环境，联合优化攻击者（合成不断进化的越狱提示）和防御者（训练既能完成任务又能抵抗攻击的任务智能体），并引入基于功能组的公共基线来稳定学习和促进合作。

Result: 在代表性攻击场景中，AdvEvo-MARL将攻击成功率保持在20%以下，而基线方法最高达到38.33%，同时保持甚至提升了任务准确率（推理任务最高提升3.67%）。

Conclusion: 安全性和实用性可以在不依赖额外防护智能体或增加系统开销的情况下共同提升。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

Conclusion: AgentRec通过智能体协作有效解决了现有对话推荐系统的关键挑战，在多个指标上均优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent

Method: 开发PsychoBench基准，包含2,252个精心设计的单选题，基于美国国家咨询师认证考试，涵盖心理学各个子学科，要求深度理解和广泛知识。

Result: 评估显示先进模型如GPT-4o、Llama3.3-70B和Gemma3-27B远超通过阈值（70%准确率），而较小的开源模型（如Qwen2.5-7B、Mistral-7B）远低于通过标准。

Conclusion: 只有前沿的大型语言模型目前能够达到心理咨询考试标准，这凸显了开发心理学导向LLMs的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

Motivation: 现有CMDP方法在高维或非结构化上下文中泛化能力差，导致计算开销大、性能不稳定，需要更高效的上下文处理方法。

Method: 使用LLM将上下文输入压缩为低维语义摘要，基于近似上下文充分性概念，在保持决策关键信息的同时减少冗余。

Result: 在离散、连续、视觉和推荐基准测试中，该方法优于原始上下文和非上下文基线，提高了奖励、成功率、样本效率，同时降低了延迟和内存使用。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的摘要技术为上下文丰富、资源受限环境中的高效决策提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: LLMs能够通过灵活推理地图来增强导航体验，并整合用户偏好，展示了在地理空间任务中的潜力。

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

Method: 开发BLIND-ACT基准测试，包含90个任务捕捉三种BGD模式，基于OSWorld提供真实环境，使用LLM评估器评估代理行为。

Result: 在9个前沿模型上观察到80.8%的平均BGD率，提示干预能降低BGD水平但风险仍然存在，识别了执行优先偏见、思维行动脱节和请求优先等失败模式。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

TL;DR: LENOHA是一个安全优先、本地优先的系统，使用高精度分类器从临床FAQ返回逐字答案，避免生成错误，在临床路径中能耗极低且响应快速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者等待侵入性手术时通常有未解答的问题，但时间紧迫的工作流程和隐私限制限制了个性化咨询。

Method: 使用句子转换器分类器路由输入，从临床医生策划的FAQ返回逐字答案，消除临床路径中的自由文本生成。评估了两个领域（拔牙和胃镜检查），使用专家审查的验证集和独立测试集。

Result: E5-large-instruct编码器总体准确率0.983，AUC 0.996，仅7个错误，与GPT-4o统计无差异。非生成临床路径每次输入能耗约1.0 mWh，比本地8B SLM小170倍，延迟约0.10秒。

Conclusion: 通过返回经过验证的FAQ逐字答案，在临床路径中结构性地避免了前沿判别和生成引起的错误，支持隐私保护、可持续性和在带宽有限环境中的公平部署。

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

TL;DR: 本文主张AGI评估方法应从基于直觉的合成任务转向关注稳健任务执行能力的评估，借鉴数据科学实践来展示系统可部署性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估方法主要依赖对智能的直觉理解来设计合成任务，但这些方法在AI历史上表现不佳。需要更有效的评估方法来衡量AGI系统的实际能力。

Method: 提出基于稳健任务执行的评估设计哲学，借鉴数据科学中展示系统可可靠部署的实践方法，提供具体的AGI评估实例。

Result: 开发了一种替代性的AGI评估视角，强调通过能力展示而非直觉任务来证明AGI，提供了实用的评估框架。

Conclusion: AGI评估应转向基于稳健任务执行能力的评估方法，这种方法更能反映系统的实际部署能力和AGI潜力。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了VaPR框架，通过LLM引导的响应编辑生成硬负样本，解决了合成偏好标注中的风格和长度偏差问题，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好微调方法忽略了合成偏好标注中普遍存在的风格和长度偏差噪声，需要更高质量的负样本生成方法。

Method: 基于LLM引导的响应编辑框架，生成具有目标错误的拒绝响应，同时保持与接受响应在风格和长度上的相似性。

Result: 在10个基准测试中，VaPR模型实现了显著性能提升：LLaVA平均提升6.5%，Qwen2VL提升4.0%，Qwen2.5VL提升1.5%，特别是在推理任务上表现突出。

Conclusion: VaPR框架有效解决了合成偏好数据中的偏差问题，能够显著提升LVLM性能，且可扩展到开源LLM作为编辑器，具有很好的通用性。

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaboT是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体AI系统，能够将用户的自然语言问题转换为SPARQL查询语言，用于操作代谢组学知识图谱，显著提高了查询准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代谢组学质谱分析产生大量数据，知识图谱虽能有效组织这些数据，但需要用户深入了解其本体和查询语言语法，这构成了使用障碍。

Method: 采用多智能体系统架构，包括入口代理、验证代理、监督代理、知识图谱代理和SPARQL查询生成代理，通过LangChain和LangGraph库集成LLM与外部工具。

Result: 在50个代谢组学相关问题的测试中，MetaboT达到83.67%的准确率，远高于仅使用GPT-4o的基线方法（8.16%）。

Conclusion: MetaboT成功消除了知识图谱使用的技术障碍，通过自然语言查询实现了结构化代谢组学数据的检索，促进了数据驱动的发现。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

Conclusion: 该研究为遵循行业标准的稳健、经验验证的多智能体系统奠定了基础，连接了AI理论与网络安全实践需求。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation
for robust, empirically validated multi-agent systems that adhere to industry
standards.

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

TL;DR: 提出了PTA-GRPO框架，通过两阶段方法改进LLM的推理能力：第一阶段使用高级LLM将思维链提炼为紧凑的高层指导进行监督微调；第二阶段引入指导感知的强化学习方法联合优化最终输出和高层指导质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的推理过程受限于自回归的token级生成，缺乏全局规划，导致推理冗余、不连贯或不准确。现有方法如树搜索和RL计算成本高且难以产生最优推理轨迹。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用高级LLM将CoT提炼为高层指导进行SFT；2) 提出指导感知的RL方法，联合优化最终输出和指导质量。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试（MATH、AIME2024、AIME2025、AMC）和不同基础模型（Qwen2.5-7B、Qwen3-8B/14B、LLaMA3.2-3B）上均取得稳定显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO能有效提升LLM的推理能力，具有很好的泛化性，在不同模型和任务上都能实现稳定改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种对抗性逆强化学习方法，为大型语言模型推理学习密集的token级奖励模型，通过过程监督而非风格模仿来优化推理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过监督微调模仿专家风格，但无法提供过程级别的反馈。本文旨在学习能够评估推理过程正确性的奖励模型，而不仅仅是表面形式。

Method: 使用对抗性逆强化学习从专家演示中学习密集的token级奖励模型。该奖励模型在训练时提供步骤级反馈优化推理策略，在推理时作为批评器对采样轨迹进行重排序。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，使用Llama3和Qwen2.5骨干网络验证了：(1)密集推理奖励可作为学习信号激发推理；(2)通过奖励引导的重排序提高了预测性能（特别是基于Llama的策略）。

Conclusion: 通过将训练信号、推理时选择和token级诊断统一到单个推理奖励中，该方法展示了可重用的过程级奖励在增强语言模型多步推理方面的广泛潜力。

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

*Paweł Parys,Sairam Vaidya,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Loris D'Antoni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CARS方法，通过自适应剪枝提高约束生成的采样效率，同时保持语言模型分布不变形


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束生成方法存在两极化问题：贪婪约束解码会扭曲LM分布，而拒绝采样会浪费计算资源丢弃无效输出。在程序模糊测试等需要有效性和多样性的领域，这两种方法都有问题

Method: CARS从无约束LM采样开始，自适应地排除违反约束的延续，通过记录到trie中并从未来抽取中减去其概率质量。自适应剪枝确保已证明无效的前缀不会被重新访问

Result: 在程序模糊测试和分子生成等领域的实验中，CARS始终实现更高的效率（以每个有效样本的LM前向传递次数衡量），同时比GCD和近似LM分布的方法产生更强的样本多样性

Conclusion: CARS严格提高了拒绝采样的样本效率而不产生分布扭曲，接受率单调提高，生成的样本严格遵循约束分布

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估大语言模型与人类集体决策对齐的框架，通过Lost at Sea实验发现LLM在集体推理中的表现存在差异，有些反映人类偏见，有些则试图补偿偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型越来越多地用于建模和增强集体决策，需要检验它们与人类社会推理的对齐程度，特别是集体层面的对齐，而非仅关注个体层面。

Method: 使用Lost at Sea社会心理学任务进行大规模在线实验（N=748），随机分配组别进行领导选举，比较有可见人口属性（姓名、性别）和匿名化别名的差异，然后模拟匹配的LLM组别进行基准测试。

Result: LLM行为出现分化：有些反映人类偏见；有些掩盖这些偏见并试图补偿。人类-AI在集体推理中的对齐取决于上下文、线索和模型特定的归纳偏差。

Conclusion: 理解LLM如何与集体人类行为对齐对于推进社会对齐AI至关重要，需要能够捕捉集体推理复杂性的动态基准测试。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种确定性模拟框架，为评估AI生成的同行评审报告提供首个稳定、基于证据的标准，通过分析352份模拟报告证明了其可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版生态系统面临提交量不可管理和AI无监管的双重危机，需要新的治理模式来保障科学诚信。传统纯人工同行评审缺乏可扩展的客观基准。

Method: 采用确定性模拟框架，分析352份同行评审模拟报告，识别一致的系统状态指标。

Result: 系统能够模拟校准的编辑判断，'修订'决策在所有学科中始终占多数(>50%)，'拒绝'率动态适应领域特定规范；保持稳定的程序完整性，证据锚定合规率稳定在29%。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI重新定位为机构问责的重要组成部分，为维护学术交流信任提供关键基础设施。

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,

TL;DR: ReTabAD通过恢复表格数据的文本语义来解决现有异常检测基准缺乏语义上下文的问题，提供了20个带有结构化文本元数据的表格数据集和零样本LLM框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格异常检测基准只提供原始数据点而缺乏语义上下文，忽略了特征描述和领域知识等关键文本元数据，限制了研究灵活性和模型利用领域知识的能力。

Method: 提供20个精心策划的表格数据集，包含结构化文本元数据，并实现了包括经典方法、深度学习和LLM方法在内的最先进异常检测算法，以及一个无需任务特定训练的零样本LLM框架。

Result: 语义上下文提高了检测性能，并通过支持领域感知推理增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: ReTabAD为系统探索上下文感知异常检测建立了基准，展示了文本元数据在异常检测中的作用和实用性。

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文系统研究了LLM深度层的利用情况，发现在不同评估设置下深度层的贡献差异显著：基于似然的评估中深层可被剪枝，而生成式评估中深层对推理和长程连贯性至关重要


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究认为LLM深层对表示学习贡献有限且可被移除，但这些结论基于有限评估，可能忽略了模型行为的重要方面

Method: 通过系统研究深度利用的多个维度，包括评估协议、任务类别和模型架构，分析不同层在不同设置下的贡献

Result: 知识检索集中在浅层组件，而推理准确性严重依赖深层；深层作用高度异质且依赖上下文，可通过蒸馏重塑

Conclusion: LLM深度利用高度异质且依赖上下文，强调在解释和压缩大模型时需要任务、指标和模型感知的视角

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究评估AI模型在ConceptARC基准上的抽象推理能力，发现仅基于准确率的评估会高估文本模态的抽象推理能力，低估视觉模态的抽象推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探究最先进模型是否真正理解并运用了ConceptARC任务设计者预期的抽象概念，而非仅依赖表面模式。

Method: 在ConceptARC上评估模型，变化输入模态（文本vs视觉）、是否允许使用Python工具、推理努力程度，并分析模型生成的自然语言规则。

Result: 文本模态下模型准确率可匹敌人类，但规则分析显示其多依赖表面捷径而非预期抽象；视觉模态下准确率下降，但模型仍能生成相当比例的预期抽象规则。

Conclusion: 模型在抽象推理上仍落后于人类，仅靠准确率评估会误导对模型抽象推理能力的判断，需要结合规则分析来更准确评估多模态模型的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

TL;DR: FlexDoc是一个可扩展的合成数据生成框架，通过随机模式和参数化采样生成多语言半结构化文档，显著降低文档理解模型的数据收集和标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级文档理解模型需要大量多样化且标注良好的数据集，但由于隐私约束、法律限制和手动标注的巨大成本，收集这样的数据非常昂贵。

Method: 结合随机模式和参数化采样，通过概率建模布局模式、视觉结构和内容变异性，实现可控的大规模多样化文档变体生成。

Result: 在关键信息提取任务中，使用FlexDoc生成的数据将绝对F1分数提高了11%，同时相比传统硬模板方法减少了90%以上的标注工作量。

Conclusion: FlexDoc已在实际部署中加速了企业级文档理解模型的开发，同时显著降低了数据获取和标注成本。

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Conclusion: 该研究为DRA系统的能力评估、架构改进和范式进步提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全技术（外部护栏、推理时指导和训练后对齐）在平衡安全性、实用性和可控性方面存在局限性，需要一种更动态和模块化的方法。

Method: 识别安全关键层并升级为稀疏MoE结构，路由器作为软护栏选择性激活原始MLP和新增安全专家；采用两阶段SFT策略；引入安全温度机制实现推理时动态控制。

Result: 在多个基准测试、基础模型和模型规模上，UpSafe°C对有害和越狱输入实现了稳健的安全改进，同时在通用任务上保持竞争力；安全温度实现了效用与安全性的帕累托最优边界。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLM安全指明了新方向：从静态对齐转向动态、模块化和推理感知的控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

Method: 通过理论和实证分析RLVR的学习动态，发现负干扰和赢家通吃现象，并提出针对低概率问题的数据筛选算法。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中验证了RLVR的局限性，提出的数据筛选方法显著提升了Pass@k性能。

Conclusion: RLVR的失败源于标准RL目标中的策略内采样，导致模型收敛到狭窄策略，通过专注低概率问题可以改善性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

Motivation: 计算机使用代理在自动化日常数字任务方面具有潜力，但其不可靠性和高方差阻碍了在长时程复杂任务中的应用。

Method: bBoN方法通过生成多个代理执行轨迹，并使用描述代理执行过程的行为叙事来进行轨迹选择，实现广泛探索和原则性选择。

Result: 在OSWorld上达到69.9%的新SOTA，接近人类水平的72%，在WindowsAgentArena和AndroidWorld上也表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明当采用正确方法时，扩展计算机使用代理具有显著效果，而bBoN提供了一个实现结构化轨迹理解和选择的实用框架。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

Motivation: 现有大型模型在推理过程中往往无法持续捕获或重用程序，而是陷入冗长和退化的探索，需要更有效的推理方法

Method: 引入推理抽象概念，训练模型提出多个抽象，然后通过强化学习激励基于这些抽象构建解决方案，采用双玩家RL训练范式

Result: 该方法实现了结构化探索，解耦了抽象提议和解决方案生成的学习信号，并提高了对更难问题的泛化能力

Conclusion: 推理抽象能有效引导有意义的探索，在测试时分配更多计算资源生成抽象比生成更多解决方案更有益于性能提升

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Conclusion: BioX-Bridge为生物信号跨模态知识迁移提供了高效解决方案，特别适用于大型基础模型场景。

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is vital for understanding
atomic-scale processes in materials science and biophysics. Traditional density
functional theory (DFT) methods are computationally expensive, which limits the
feasibility of long-term simulations. We propose a novel approach that
formulates MD simulation as a time-series forecasting problem, enabling
advanced forecasting models to predict atomic trajectories via displacements
rather than absolute positions. We incorporate a physics-informed loss and
inference mechanism based on DFT-parametrised pair-wise Morse potential
functions that penalize unphysical atomic proximity to enforce physical
plausibility. Our method consistently surpasses standard baselines in
simulation accuracy across diverse materials. The results highlight the
importance of incorporating physics knowledge to enhance the reliability and
precision of atomic trajectory forecasting. Remarkably, it enables stable
modeling of thousands of MD steps in minutes, offering a scalable alternative

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，选择性采样在高温设置下也能改善质量-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: 选择性采样方法有效解决了高温采样在精度敏感任务中的准确性问题，同时保持了输出多样性。

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs
generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy
to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g.,
mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$
or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of
accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding
positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective
sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and
high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric
estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature
sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a
lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained
classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency
overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that
selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in
high-temperature settings.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了最大的LLM整理热电数据集，建立了可扩展的数据驱动材料发现基础，并发布了交互式网络探索器以促进社区访问。

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large,
machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural
context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased
toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature
underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven
workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties
from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates
dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional
table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on
50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91
for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1
Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction
of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow,
we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units,
spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity,
power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes
such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis
reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of
alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing
broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we
release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and
CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset
to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and
establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond
thermoelectrics.

Conclusion: 该工作为受限环境提供了实用解决方案，并在信息几何和神经网络量化之间建立了理论桥梁，推动了高效深度学习发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially
increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on
resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for
low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key
challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In
this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit
quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that
effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity
Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced
Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity
directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed
along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses
error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which
constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to
dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally
optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments
demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in
2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by
0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a
practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge
between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing
efficient deep learning.

*Vedant Palit*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于信任感知深度Q网络的联邦学习防御方法，通过整合多信号证据更新客户端信任度，优化长期鲁棒性-准确性目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在部分可观测性下容易受到投毒和后门攻击，需要设计有效的防御机制。

Method: 将防御建模为部分可观测序列决策问题，使用信任感知深度Q网络整合多信号证据进行客户端信任更新。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上验证：1）建立准确率稳定提升的基线；2）增加客户端重叠度能持续提高准确率并降低攻击成功率；3）减少可观测性时准确率保持稳定但攻击成功率上升；4）DQN在鲁棒性-准确性权衡上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 基于信任感知深度Q网络的防御方法能有效应对联邦学习中的投毒和后门攻击，实现良好的鲁棒性-准确性平衡。

Abstract: Federated learning is vulnerable to poisoning and backdoor attacks under
partial observability. We formulate defence as a partially observable
sequential decision problem and introduce a trust-aware Deep Q-Network that
integrates multi-signal evidence into client trust updates while optimizing a
long-horizon robustness--accuracy objective. On CIFAR-10, we (i) establish a
baseline showing steadily improving accuracy, (ii) show through a Dirichlet
sweep that increased client overlap consistently improves accuracy and reduces
ASR with stable detection, and (iii) demonstrate in a signal-budget study that
accuracy remains steady while ASR increases and ROC-AUC declines as
observability is reduced, which highlights that sequential belief updates
mitigate weaker signals. Finally, a comparison with random, linear-Q, and
policy gradient controllers confirms that DQN achieves the best
robustness--accuracy trade-off.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of train delays is critical for efficient railway
operations, enabling better scheduling and dispatching decisions. While earlier
approaches have largely focused on forecasting the exact delays of individual
trains, recent studies have begun exploring station-level delay prediction to
support higher-level traffic management. In this paper, we propose the
Railway-centric Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (RSTGCN), designed
to forecast average arrival delays of all the incoming trains at railway
stations for a particular time period. Our approach incorporates several
architectural innovations and novel feature integrations, including train
frequency-aware spatial attention, which significantly enhances predictive
performance. To support this effort, we curate and release a comprehensive
dataset for the entire Indian Railway Network (IRN), spanning 4,735 stations
across 17 zones - the largest and most diverse railway network studied to date.
We conduct extensive experiments using multiple state-of-the-art baselines,
demonstrating consistent improvements across standard metrics. Our work not
only advances the modeling of average delay prediction in large-scale rail
networks but also provides an open dataset to encourage further research in
this critical domain.

*Yaron Meirovitch,Fuming Yang,Jeff Lichtman,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Budgeted Broadcast (BB)剪枝方法，通过给每个单元分配本地流量预算（激活率与扇出的乘积），在全局流量预算约束下最大化编码熵，实现选择性-受众平衡，从而提高网络多样性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法基于损失影响（如幅度或梯度）来移除参数，而BB方法旨在通过优化编码熵和去相关性来学习更多样化和高效的表示。

Method: BB为每个单元分配本地流量预算（a_i × k_i），通过约束熵分析得出选择性-受众平衡公式，并使用简单的本地执行器剪枝扇入（降低激活率）或扇出（减少广播）。

Result: 在ASR的Transformer、人脸识别的ResNet和突触预测的3D U-Net上，BB在相同稀疏度下提高了编码熵、去相关性和准确率，有时甚至超过密集基线。在电子显微镜图像上，获得了最先进的F1和PR-AUC。

Conclusion: BB方法易于集成，为学习更多样化和高效的表示提供了一条路径，通过优化编码熵和选择性-受众平衡来改进网络剪枝效果。

Abstract: Most pruning methods remove parameters ranked by impact on loss (e.g.,
magnitude or gradient). We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each
unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and
fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding
entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance,
$\log\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local
actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce
broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and
improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for
face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding
dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1
and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol. BB is easy to integrate and suggests
a path toward learning more diverse and efficient representations.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is central to robotic systems
cooperating in dynamic environments. While prior work has focused on these

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的大模型训练范式仅在最后阶段使用强化学习，作者质疑这种方式的优化性，希望将强化学习的探索精神更早地引入预训练阶段。

Method: 提出RLP目标，将思维链视为探索动作，奖励基于思维链提供的未来token预测信息增益计算，即比较有思维链和无思维链时下一个token的log-likelihood差异。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B-Base上预训练后，八项数学科学基准平均提升19%；在Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2上，整体平均从42.81%提升至61.32%，科学推理任务提升23%。

Conclusion: RLP成功将强化学习重新定义为普通文本的预训练目标，弥合了next-token预测与有用思维链推理之间的差距，可扩展到不同架构和模型规模。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with
pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data.
Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only
as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning.
While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present
RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the
core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of
pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory
action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for
predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the
model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an
independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the
reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when
conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to
conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense
reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream
during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for
reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between
next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.
Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an
eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training,
the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such
as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2
increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on
scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and
model sizes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的LQR控制器需要精确的系统模型，而纯RL控制器在训练阶段缺乏先验知识，可能对结构造成损害。研究发现即使基于错误模型的LQR控制器也比无控制效果好，这启发了混合控制方法。

Method: 提出混合控制框架，整合LQR和RL控制器。LQR策略基于随机选择的模型和参数，不需要真实或近似结构模型，保持整体框架的无模型特性。

Result: 该混合方法消除了对显式系统模型的依赖，同时最小化了纯RL实现中的探索风险。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决RL振动控制关键训练安全挑战并提供验证解决方案的研究。

Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,
including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased
maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their
reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.
This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free
Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely
from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit
structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training
must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,
during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it
exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the
structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a
Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies
on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations
indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model
outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this
approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its
parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an
approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This
hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while
minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our
knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety
challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了对RNN复杂机制的理解，还为设计更鲁棒和可解释的神经网络提供了有价值的工具，显著促进了可解释人工智能的发展。

Abstract: Understanding the internal dynamics of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is
crucial for advancing their interpretability and improving their design. This
study introduces an innovative information-theoretic method to identify and
analyze information-transfer nodes within RNNs, which we refer to as
\textit{information relays}. By quantifying the mutual information between
input and output vectors across nodes, our approach pinpoints critical pathways
through which information flows during network operations. We apply this
methodology to both synthetic and real-world time series classification tasks,
employing various RNN architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Our results reveal distinct patterns
of information relay across different architectures, offering insights into how
information is processed and maintained over time. Additionally, we conduct
node knockout experiments to assess the functional importance of identified
nodes, significantly contributing to explainable artificial intelligence by
elucidating how specific nodes influence overall network behavior. This study
not only enhances our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving RNNs but
also provides a valuable tool for designing more robust and interpretable
neural networks.

Result: 在多样化数据集上大幅超越现有PU方法，包括灾害后建筑损伤映射等实际应用场景

Conclusion: NcPU框架通过非对比学习有效解决了PU学习中的表示学习瓶颈，在复杂数据集上取得了显著性能提升

Abstract: Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning aims to train a binary classifier (positive
vs. negative) where only limited positive data and abundant unlabeled data are
available. While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods
substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets,
especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a
14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the
challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable
supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU
learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a
noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns
intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom
label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative
supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can
iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the
Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments
demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive
performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging
datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for
real-world applications. Code: Code will be open-sourced after review.

Motivation: 从人类视觉感知中的微眼动现象获得灵感，微眼动能揭示隐藏的感知动态，类似地希望通过轻量级扰动来揭示LLM的潜在错误信号。

Method: 使用轻量级位置编码扰动作为探测手段，无需微调或任务特定监督，通过分析模型对这些扰动的响应来检测错误行为。

Result: 在多个先进LLM上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测事实性、安全性、毒性和后门攻击等各类错误，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 预训练的LLM已经编码了标记自身错误所需的内部证据，微眼动启发的干预为检测和缓解不良行为提供了途径。

Abstract: We draw inspiration from microsaccades, tiny involuntary eye movements that
reveal hidden dynamics of human perception, to propose an analogous probing
method for large language models (LLMs). Just as microsaccades expose subtle
but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding
perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our
method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects
failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and
backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate
that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining
computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already
encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that
microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and
mitigating undesirable behaviours.

TL;DR: ThinKV是一个思想自适应的KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合量化-驱逐策略和高效内存管理，在保持接近无损准确性的同时将KV缓存减少到原始大小的5%以下，推理吞吐量提升高达5.8倍。


<details>

Conclusion: ThinKV通过思想自适应压缩有效解决了KV缓存内存瓶颈问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: The long-output context generation of large reasoning models enables extended
chain of thought (CoT) but also drives rapid growth of the key-value (KV)
cache, quickly overwhelming GPU memory. To address this challenge, we propose
ThinKV, a thought-adaptive KV cache compression framework. ThinKV is based on
the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with
varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction
strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively
evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve.
Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends
PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots,
eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill,
GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show
that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original
KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference
throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance
of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay
reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and
emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;
However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data
follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver
behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced
model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain
adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse
intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,
extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled
subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with
Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the
target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from
57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is
evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven
instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides
more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable
traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based
planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader
deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.

state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and
applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview
ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the
clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of

computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the
emerging research directions including multimodal integration and
cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a
structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify
opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable,
and clinically impactful solutions.

Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training
loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy
assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data
model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not
require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the
mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with
respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two
rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned
with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of
the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the
balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that
standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian

*Aritra Das,Joseph T. Iosue,Victor V. Albert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个量子启发的内在维度估计基准QuIIEst，包含无限族拓扑非平凡流形，测试现有IDE方法在复杂流形上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内在维度估计方法在真实数据集上表现不一，需要更复杂的基准来评估这些方法，因为真实数据集通常位于具有小内在维度的潜在流形上。

Method: 基于量子光学方法构建QuIIEst基准，包含无限族拓扑非平凡流形，允许曲率修改和加性噪声，并在分形Hofstadter蝴蝶上进行IDE测试。

Result: 现有IDE方法在QuIIEst流形上的准确性低于现有基准，且随着曲率不均匀性增加性能下降最小，表明基准具有固有难度。

Conclusion: QuIIEst基准为IDE方法提供了更具挑战性的测试平台，揭示了现有方法在复杂流形上的局限性，并展示了在非流形空间提取有效维度的能力。

Abstract: Machine learning models can generalize well on real-world datasets. According
to the manifold hypothesis, this is possible because datasets lie on a latent
manifold with small intrinsic dimension (ID). There exist many methods for ID
estimation (IDE), but their estimates vary substantially. This warrants
benchmarking IDE methods on manifolds that are more complex than those in
existing benchmarks. We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension
Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically
non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical
method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature
modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less
accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical
resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with
increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent
difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal
Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the
effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.

Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a
framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video

statistical benefits and potential sources of unidentifiability. Finally, we
prove that an entropy-regularized LAPO objective identifies action

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文从变分互信息下界出发，推导出两种自监督表示学习范式：自蒸馏互信息和联合互信息，为现有方法的架构设计提供了理论解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督表示学习虽然取得了显著经验成功，但其理论基础仍不充分。现有工作往往将预测器网络、停止梯度操作等架构元素视为经验性添加，缺乏理论依据。

Method: 从变分互信息下界出发，推导出两种训练范式：自蒸馏互信息需要交替优化，停止梯度操作理论必需；联合互信息允许通过对称架构进行联合优化。

Result: 证明了现有自监督学习方法都是这两种范式的具体实例或近似，预测器网络和统计正则化器分别作为互信息目标的可行替代。

Conclusion: 为不同自监督学习方法的架构组件选择提供了超越启发式便利的理论解释，建立了学习目标与优化策略、模型设计之间的理论联系。

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) has demonstrated remarkable
empirical success, yet its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood. While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their
information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing
representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network,
stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as
empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles
approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm
dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In
particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound,
we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint
MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of
existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization,
making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI
admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such
components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and
statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI
objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or
approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical
explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of
existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种量化数据集各向异性（对称性破缺）的方法，通过双样本神经分类器测试来区分原始数据集与其随机增强版本，揭示了基准点云数据集中存在的高度对齐现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对称感知机器学习方法（如数据增强和等变架构）假设变换后的数据点在测试分布中具有高概率或"重要性"，但这一假设缺乏严格的评估方法。

Method: 开发了一种度量数据集各向异性的方法，使用双样本神经分类器测试来区分原始数据集和其随机增强版本，并在合成数据集和基准点云数据集上进行验证。

Result: 在多个基准点云数据集中发现了出乎意料的高度对齐现象；理论上证明分布对称性破缺会阻止不变方法达到最优性能；经验发现等变方法在部分各向异性数据集上仍有益处，但在其他数据集上则无。

Conclusion: 理解等变性（包括其何时有效及原因）可能需要重新思考数据中的对称性偏置，对称感知方法的效果具有数据集依赖性。

Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and
equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all
transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These
methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption
that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the
test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating
this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of
anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural
classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its
randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets,
and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several
benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional
symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing
optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for
invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find
that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent:
equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not
others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both
when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统非牛顿流体动力学数值方法计算成本高、扩展性差，现有数据驱动方法仍需在不同物理条件下重新训练，需要开发更高效的模拟方法。

Method: 使用自注意力机制的生成算子学习方法，学习复杂流体流动的不同空间相互作用和特征，在多种流变测量和非流变测量流动中进行基准测试。

Result: RheOFormer能够准确学习不同复杂流体的标量和张量非线性力学，预测其流动的时空演化，即使在有限数据集上训练也能表现出色。

Abstract: The ability to model mechanics of soft materials under flowing conditions is
key in designing and engineering processes and materials with targeted
properties. This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related
to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive
models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often
suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new
problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some
limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In
this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a
generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently
learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We
benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and
non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and
elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions.
Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and
tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the
spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited
datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency
establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive
complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling
real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.

Motivation: 扩散模型在训练时学习得分函数用于生成样本，但一个基本未解问题是：它们实际学习的是哪个得分？完全匹配经验得分会导致简单复制训练数据而无法生成新样本。

Method: 引入选择性欠拟合概念，通过表征这些区域并设计实证干预来验证该观点。

Result: 研究结果表明选择性欠拟合对于理解扩散模型至关重要，为模型的泛化和生成性能提供了新的可测试见解。

Conclusion: 选择性欠拟合是理解扩散模型泛化机制的关键，更好的模型在特定区域更准确地学习得分函数，而在其他区域保持欠拟合状态。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the principal paradigm for generative
modeling across various domains. During training, they learn the score
function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a
basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle,
a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space
would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples.
Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit
the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we
refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting:
instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more
accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while
underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical
interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective
underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new,
testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM是一个轻量级、模型无关的方法，用于掩码扩散模型（MDM）的推理时自校正，无需重新训练模型即可检测和修正低质量token。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型需要自校正能力来检测和修正推理时的低质量token，但现有方法要么需要重构MDM架构/训练，要么依赖不精确的token质量代理，限制了应用范围。

Method: PRISM定义了一个自校正损失函数，可证明地学习每个token的质量分数，无需强化学习或验证器。这些质量分数与MDM在同一前向传播中计算，用于检测低质量token。

Result: PRISM在多个领域和规模上提升了MDM推理性能：数独、无条件文本生成（170M参数）以及使用LLaDA的代码生成（8B参数）。

Conclusion: PRISM为预训练MDM提供了一个有效的推理时自校正方法，无需修改模型架构或重新训练。

Abstract: A natural desideratum for generative models is self-correction--detecting and
revising low-quality tokens at inference. While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs)
have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete
spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior
attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling
MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality,
limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in
Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a
lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM.
Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns
per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are
computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality
tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales:
Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).

Motivation: LLM生成需要在输出质量和推理成本之间取得平衡，特别是在需要多次生成时，需要决定何时停止生成

Method: 将每次生成视为打开一个代价随机的"盒子"，开发UCB风格的潘多拉盒算法，结合Bradley-Terry变换处理不同提示的奖励缩放问题

Result: 在AlpacaFarm和HH-RLHF数据集上，使用自适应策略可获得与Best-of-N采样相同的性能，同时平均减少15-35%的生成次数

Conclusion: 在最优停止理论和推理时扩展之间建立了原则性桥梁，为LLM部署提供了理论性能保证和实际效率提升

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality
against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We
introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the
classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly
"box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop
generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first
contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance
that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the
distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings
by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired
transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method
that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments
on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs,
show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive
Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average.
Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and
inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and
practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Conclusion: 该框架使基于梯度的自由能方法能够整合复杂和机器学习的集体变量，拓宽了生物化学和材料模拟的应用范围。

Abstract: Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
require Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that
restricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural
network surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates
and uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical
forms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for
both a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,
Jacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them
suitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy
methods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of
biochemistry and materials simulations.

Conclusion: 基于低秩表示的压缩重建框架有效解决了神经压缩中的解码器瓶颈问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital
applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive
compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by
the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders
during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural
compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on
incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector
quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally
efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images
can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach
dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural
compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute
bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

TL;DR: SoftAdaClip是一种差分隐私训练方法，用tanh平滑变换替代硬裁剪，在保护隐私的同时减少子群体间的不公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD中的梯度裁剪会不成比例地抑制少数子群体的学习信号，降低模型性能和公平性

Method: 使用基于tanh的平滑变换替代硬裁剪，保留梯度相对大小同时限制敏感度，结合自适应机制

Result: 在多个数据集上，SoftAdaClip相比DP-SGD减少子群体差异达87%，相比Adaptive-DPSGD减少48%，且差异减少具有统计显著性

Conclusion: 将平滑变换与自适应机制结合对于实现公平和隐私保护的模型训练至关重要

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but
often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented
groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can
disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations.
Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard
clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce
SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard
clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient
magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various
datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured
healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip
reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48%
compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are
statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of
integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and
private model training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Softmax注意力的高效替代方案已被广泛研究，但基于理论洞察的更具表达力的机制（即使计算成本更高）相对较少探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 从测试时回归视角推导出Local Linear Attention (LLA)，提出两种内存高效原语应对计算复杂度，开发FlashLLA硬件高效块状算法，并实现定制推理内核减少内存开销。

Result: 实验验证显示LLA在测试时回归、上下文回归、关联记忆和状态跟踪任务中有效适应非平稳性，在测试时训练和上下文学习中优于强基线，并展现出在大规模模型中可扩展性和适用性的有希望证据。

Conclusion: LLA通过理论优势、计算优化和实证验证，为注意力机制提供了新的表达力更强的替代方案，特别适用于需要适应非平稳性的场景。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely
studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical
insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored.
In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a
novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the
lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical
advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a
bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges
and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\Theta(n^2 d)$ and
$\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient,
blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern
accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference
kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically
validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression,
in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment
results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity,
outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning,
and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in
large-scale models. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决扩散模型在OOD检测中计算成本高的问题，需要开发一种既快速又准确的检测方法，适用于视觉、机器人控制等多个领域。

Method: 结合雅可比迹和得分函数平方范数形成单一测试统计量，使用核密度估计估计分布内密度，仅需单次前向传递和一个雅可比向量积。

Result: 在四个视觉基准测试中达到竞争性或最先进的精度-召回分数，在机器人控制任务中也能识别跨奖励函数和训练机制的分布偏移。

Conclusion: SCOPED为现实世界领域的快速可靠OOD检测提供了实用基础，适用于视觉感知伪影、自回归模型异常检测、强化学习探索和无监督训练数据集管理。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliable deployment of
machine learning systems in vision, robotics, reinforcement learning, and
beyond. We introduce Score-Curvature Out-of-distribution Proximity Evaluator
for Diffusion (SCOPED), a fast and general-purpose OOD detection method for
diffusion models that reduces the number of forward passes on the trained model
by an order of magnitude compared to prior methods, outperforming most
diffusion-based baselines and closely approaching the accuracy of the strongest
ones. SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a
diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the
model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding
on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores
using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that,
in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one
Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator.
On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art
precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method
generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces,
identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.
These results position SCOPED as a practical foundation for fast and reliable
OOD detection in real-world domains, including perceptual artifacts in vision,
outlier detection in autoregressive models, exploration in reinforcement
learning, and dataset curation for unsupervised training.

focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and
critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of
strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work
shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites
involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to
sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing
in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This
reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into
algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues
behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that
induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy
coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model
variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes
enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to
outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance
previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental
average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop
taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic
failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how
benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms
generalize.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance their capabilities, aligning these
models with human preferences has become crucial. Preference optimization,
which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred
responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning
LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is
unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.
This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,
providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we
consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise,
such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume
convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering
new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how
generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise
rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our
analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference
optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on
contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering
valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.

TL;DR: 提出LSPO算法，基于响应长度动态选择训练数据，提升RLVR在推理任务中的学习效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受LLM过度思考现象研究的启发，探索如何通过动态数据选择改进强化学习与可验证奖励方法

Method: LSPO（长度感知采样策略优化），一种元RLVR算法，根据平均响应长度在每个步骤动态选择训练数据

Result: 在多个基础模型和数据集上评估，LSPO持续提升学习效果，并通过消融研究分析长度信号的不同整合方式

Conclusion: LSPO有效改进RLVR训练，为未来研究提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models
(LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss
functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated
by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy
Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects
training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate
LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it
consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a
detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length
signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting
promising directions for future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一个稳定性-可塑性原则来解释离线到在线强化学习中的不一致性，强调在在线微调时应保留预训练策略或离线数据集中表现更好的知识，同时保持足够的可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线到在线强化学习的经验行为高度不一致，在一个设置中有效的在线微调设计选择在另一个设置中可能完全失败，需要解释这种不一致性。

Method: 提出了稳定性-可塑性原则框架，识别了三种在线微调机制，每种机制需要不同的稳定性特性，并通过大规模实证研究验证该框架。

Result: 在63个案例中的45个案例中，实证结果与该框架的预测高度一致，验证了该原则的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为基于离线数据集和预训练策略相对性能的离线到在线强化学习设计选择提供了原则性框架。

Abstract: Offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a practical
paradigm that leverages offline datasets for pretraining and online
interactions for fine-tuning. However, its empirical behavior is highly
inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one
setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity
principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge
of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is
better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies
three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability
properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study,
finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases.
This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in
offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset
and the pretrained policy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于LLM的贝叶斯优化方法LoRA-VBLL，通过LoRA微调和变分贝叶斯线性层来处理高维不规则变量的黑盒优化问题，并通过集成方法进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高斯过程在应对高维不规则变量（如分类、序数变量）的黑盒优化问题时表现不佳，而神经网络代理模型计算成本高。受LLM强大能力启发，采用LLM作为代理模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 使用LLM作为代理模型，通过LoRA微调参数，结合变分贝叶斯线性层框架。采用加权集成方法自动选择LoRA秩和其他超参数，支持递归更新。

Result: 在多个高维基准测试和真实世界分子优化任务中，提出的(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL方法表现出色。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的LoRA-VBLL方法为高维不规则变量的黑盒优化问题提供了高效解决方案，在计算效率和性能方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: A plethora of applications entail solving black-box optimization problems
with high evaluation costs, including drug discovery, material design, as well
as hyperparameter tuning. Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box
optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a
theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model
so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced
exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto
choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla
BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping
with high-dimensional counterparts with {\it irregular} variables (e.g.,
categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates
have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the
LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input
variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we
leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters
together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational
Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only
computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits
recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well
as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has
been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model
weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed
(ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the
real-world molecular optimization tasks.

*Hengyi Zhu,Grace Li Zhang,Shaoyi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEL-NAS是一种基于LLM的神经架构搜索方法，通过搜索空间分区、架构提示协同进化和零成本预测器，在保持高精度的同时显著降低延迟和搜索成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统HW-NAS方法搜索成本高和LLM驱动方法存在的探索偏差问题，即LLM倾向于在有限搜索空间内重复提出相似架构设计。

Method: 1) 复杂度驱动分区引擎按复杂度划分搜索空间；2) LLM驱动的架构提示协同进化算子，通过知识库更新和引导进化算法改进设计；3) 零成本预测器避免大量候选架构训练。

Result: 在HW-NAS-Bench上，PEL-NAS相比基线方法获得更高的HV、更低的IGD，在相似精度下延迟降低达54%，搜索成本从数天降至数分钟。

Conclusion: PEL-NAS通过分区策略和协同进化机制有效解决了LLM驱动的NAS中的探索偏差问题，实现了高效、低延迟的神经架构搜索。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) requires joint
optimization of accuracy and latency under device constraints. Traditional
supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language
Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide
quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes
neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover
architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To
address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned,
architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search
that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with
reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a
complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by
complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an
LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first
updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the
previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures
with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve
together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3)
a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from
scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve
overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at
similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes
compared with traditional supernet baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning (Weighted BC)，一种鲁棒的模仿学习方法，使用小型干净参考集通过二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，在BC目标中加权以优先处理干净专家行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习数据集常被对抗性投毒、系统错误或低质量样本污染，导致标准行为克隆和离线RL方法性能下降，需要鲁棒的方法处理数据污染问题。

Method: 使用小型干净参考集训练二元判别器估计轨迹级密度比，对密度比进行裁剪后作为权重用于BC目标，优先学习干净专家行为，无需知道污染机制。

Result: 建立了理论保证，证明在有限样本下收敛到干净专家策略，且边界与污染率无关。在连续控制基准测试中，即使在高污染率下也能保持接近最优性能，优于传统BC、BCQ和BRAC等基线方法。

Conclusion: Weighted BC是一种有效的鲁棒模仿学习方法，能够处理各种类型的污染数据，在数据质量不确定的实际应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy optimization from fixed
datasets, making it suitable for safety-critical applications where online
exploration is infeasible. However, these datasets are often contaminated by
adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to
degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL
methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning
(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified
clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary
discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective
to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding
corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We
establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy
with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A
comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various
poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous
control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains
near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming
baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and
behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出攻击可转移性的关键区别：在输入数据空间的攻击可以成功转移，而在模型表示空间的攻击通常无法转移，除非表示空间有几何对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为什么图像对抗样本和文本越狱攻击能在模型间转移，但视觉语言模型的图像越狱攻击却无法转移，揭示攻击转移性的根本原因。

Method: 通过四个实验验证假设：1) 数学证明相同输入输出映射但不同表示的网络；2) 构建图像分类器的表示空间攻击；3) 构建语言模型的表示空间攻击；4) 构建视觉语言模型的数据空间攻击。

Result: 表示空间攻击虽然能成功攻击目标模型但无法转移，而数据空间攻击可以成功转移。只有当表示空间几何对齐时，表示空间攻击才能转移。

Conclusion: 对抗转移性不是所有攻击的固有属性，而是取决于其操作域——共享数据空间与模型独特表示空间的区别，这对构建更鲁棒模型具有重要启示。

Abstract: The field of adversarial robustness has long established that adversarial
examples can successfully transfer between image classifiers and that text
jailbreaks can successfully transfer between language models (LMs). However, a
pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image
jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking
difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability
of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can
transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not
without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and
empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we
mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks
compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we
construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as
successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we
construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak
the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space
attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that
representation space attacks \emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries
are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that
adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent
on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique
representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.

Motivation: 多智能体LLM推理快速发展，但如何有效聚合多个LLM的答案成为关键挑战。标准多数投票平等对待所有答案，忽略了模型间的潜在异质性和相关性。

Method: 设计了两种新算法：最优权重(OW)和逆惊喜流行度(ISP)，利用一阶和二阶信息来改进聚合过程。

Result: 在合成数据集、LLM微调基准(UltraFeedback、MMLU)和真实医疗场景(ARMMAN)上验证，新方法始终优于多数投票。

Conclusion: OW和ISP算法不仅提供实际性能提升，还为设计鲁棒的多智能体LLM流水线提供了概念性见解。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of multi-agent large language model (LLM) reasoning,
how to effectively aggregate answers from multiple LLMs has emerged as a
fundamental challenge. Standard majority voting treats all answers equally,
failing to consider latent heterogeneity and correlation across models. In this
work, we design two new aggregation algorithms called Optimal Weight (OW) and
Inverse Surprising Popularity (ISP), leveraging both first-order and
second-order information. Our theoretical analysis shows these methods provably
mitigate inherent limitations of majority voting under mild assumptions,
leading to more reliable collective decisions. We empirically validate our
algorithms on synthetic datasets, popular LLM fine-tuning benchmarks such as
UltraFeedback and MMLU, and a real-world healthcare setting ARMMAN. Across all
cases, our methods consistently outperform majority voting, offering both
practical performance gains and conceptual insights for the design of robust
multi-agent LLM pipelines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) applications in Clinical Decision Support Systems
(CDSS) frequently encounter skepticism from practitioners regarding inoperable
dosing decisions. We address this challenge with an end-to-end approach for
learning optimal drug dosing and control policies for dual vasopressor
administration in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock. For
realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete,
continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline
conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to
capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis
of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations
reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate
clinical adoption while preserving efficacy. Empirical results1 on eICU and
MIMIC demonstrate that action space design profoundly influences learned
behavioral policies. The proposed methods achieve improved patient outcomes of
over 15% in survival improvement probability, while aligning with established
clinical protocols.

Conclusion: 概率节点-关系等变性是提升知识图谱基础模型表达能力的有效方法，Flock模型证明了其在零样本链接预测任务中的优越性。

Abstract: We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs),
which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations.
Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing
equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties
of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with
similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of
deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of
KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but
semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in
distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries
during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that
iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording
protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of
nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock
perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail,
and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction
tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.

Abstract: The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect
animal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal
unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of
violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive
framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million
reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary
Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized
AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,
and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were
integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,
including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language
models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as
undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal
outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,
achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average
Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved
minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.
Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,
including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug
physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal
outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data
engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,
interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports
FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,
strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical
decision-making.

Motivation: 现有碳强度预测工具存在三个主要限制：需要特定电网的电力结构数据、依赖单独的电网特定模型难以实现全球覆盖、不提供不确定性估计。

Method: 利用时间序列基础模型的通用性，仅使用历史碳强度数据和单一通用模型，实现碳强度预测和填补任务。

Result: 在214个全球电网上的零样本预测MAPE为15.82%；在13个基准电网上平均MAPE为9.59%，尾部预测MAPE为16.54%，并提供95%覆盖率的预测区间；可提供长达21天的预测；在填补任务上比统计基线提升1.2-3.9倍。

Conclusion: CarbonX能够在数据有限的情况下轻松应用于任何电网，并提供强大性能，是适用于全球规模脱碳的实用工具。

Abstract: Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing
and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built
environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts,
yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific
electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable;
(ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to
provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty
estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications.
  In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time
Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX
utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple
tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse
grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model,
our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX
performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average
MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing
prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to
21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned,
CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation
task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any
grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a
practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.

Abstract: Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary
weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for
classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small
perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and
the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem
over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an
integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often
challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$
constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we
introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class
setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities
for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find
that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input
perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.

*Lecheng Kong,Xiyuan Wang,Yixin Chen,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL)框架，通过双向转换成功率作为奖励信号来训练模型，提升大语言模型在化学任务中的一致性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化学大语言模型缺乏双向一致性，例如能成功描述分子结构但无法从自身生成的文本准确重建原始结构，这表明模型学习的是单向记忆而非灵活掌握。

Method: 引入RTRL框架，使用双向转换成功作为奖励信号进行强化学习训练；提出迭代变体，让前向和反向映射交替训练彼此，形成自改进循环。

Result: 实验表明RTRL在监督、自监督和合成数据机制下，显著提升了模型性能和一致性，优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 双向一致性不仅是理想特性，更是可训练目标，为构建更稳健可靠的基座模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for
computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction
and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency.
For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a
molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from
its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning
unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work
has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency
and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes
consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce
Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model
to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation
as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and
reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a
process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive
amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that
RTRL significantly \textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong
baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This
work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a
trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable
foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种绕过提示防护的新攻击方法，能够成功越狱Google Gemini、DeepSeek Chat、Grok和Mistral Le Chat等生产模型，揭示了轻量级提示防护的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，确保AI安全和对齐至关重要。轻量级提示防护机制虽然易于实现和更新，但其安全性存在隐患。

Method: 利用提示防护与主LLM之间的资源不对称性，编码一种轻量级防护无法解码但主模型能够解码的越狱提示。

Result: 攻击方法在多个生产模型中持续成功越狱，同时保持响应质量，揭示了轻量级提示防护在现代LLM架构中的固有攻击面。

Conclusion: 需要将防御重点从阻止恶意输入转向防止恶意输出，并识别了版权数据提取、训练数据提取和思维过程中的恶意响应泄露等其他关键对齐问题。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, ensuring AI safety and alignment is
paramount. One popular approach is prompt guards, lightweight mechanisms
designed to filter malicious queries while being easy to implement and update.
In this work, we introduce a new attack that circumvents such prompt guards,
highlighting their limitations. Our method consistently jailbreaks production
models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat
interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok
(3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry
between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that
lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack
surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and
underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to
preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment
issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and
malicious response leakage during thinking.

Conclusion: 该框架为在下一代蜂窝系统中可扩展地集成AI/ML模型奠定了基础，是实现原生智能6G网络愿景的关键。

Abstract: 6G brings a paradigm shift towards AI-native wireless systems, necessitating
the seamless integration of digital signal processing (DSP) and machine
learning (ML) within the software stacks of cellular networks. This
transformation brings the life cycle of modern networks closer to AI systems,
where models and algorithms are iteratively trained, simulated, and deployed
across adjacent environments. In this work, we propose a robust framework that
compiles Python-based algorithms into GPU-runnable blobs. The result is a
unified approach that ensures efficiency, flexibility, and the highest possible
performance on NVIDIA GPUs. As an example of the capabilities of the framework,
we demonstrate the efficacy of performing the channel estimation function in
the PUSCH receiver through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained in
Python. This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time
testbed. Our proposed methodology, realized in the NVIDIA AI Aerial platform,
lays the foundation for scalable integration of AI/ML models into
next-generation cellular systems, and is essential for realizing the vision of
natively intelligent 6G networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测方法需要大量人工预处理、验证和集成工作，且现有模型泛化能力差，亟需一个通用的、领域无关的自动化框架来减少人工干预。

Method: 构建包含四个专门代理的框架：Curator进行LLM引导的数据诊断和预处理；Planner通过多模态诊断和自规划缩小模型选择空间；Forecaster执行模型拟合、验证并自适应选择最佳配置和集成策略；Reporter生成全面透明的报告。

Conclusion: TSci将预测工作流转变为可解释、可扩展的白盒系统，显著提升了预测性能和透明度，为通用时间序列预测提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse
as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face
thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon,
where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive
preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this
paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic
framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four
specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by
external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final
predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive,
transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and
comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a
white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks.
Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci
consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing
forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci
produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more
transparent and interpretable.

TL;DR: 提出了可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题评估LLM的反事实推理能力，发现从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%，强化学习相比监督微调能更好地提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估LLM反事实推理能力的方法往往跳过溯因步骤，导致高估模型性能。需要开发能完整评估三个推理步骤（溯因、干预、预测）的框架。

Method: 引入可执行反事实框架，通过代码和数学问题操作化因果推理，明确要求所有三个反事实推理步骤，并支持可扩展的合成数据创建。

Result: SOTA模型从干预推理到反事实推理准确率下降25-40%；监督微调在域内性能提升但在OOD任务上下降，而强化学习在代码和数学问题上均实现1.5-2倍改进。

Conclusion: 强化学习能诱导核心认知行为并泛化到新领域，相比监督微调更适合提升LLM的反事实推理能力。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three
steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing
alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This
skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their
applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However,
existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend
to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning
and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce
executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal
reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all
three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data
creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and
improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy
(25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like
o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set
comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on
out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a
model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems.
While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves
in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD
tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning
induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding
gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math
problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and
highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式模仿学习方法只修正当前状态的动作，而不调整未来可能更危险状态的动作，这限制了安全性和学习效率。

Method: PPL将每次人类干预引导到未来L个时间步（偏好视野），假设智能体执行相同动作且人类进行相同干预，然后在这些未来状态上应用偏好优化。

Result: 在自动驾驶和机器人操作基准测试中，PPL显著提高了学习效率，减少了所需的人类演示次数。

Conclusion: 选择合适的偏好视野L可以在风险状态覆盖和标签正确性之间取得平衡，从而限制算法最优性差距。

Abstract: Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to
monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation
learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state,
they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more
hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from
Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals
contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The
key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time
steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent
follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the
preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states,
expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the
agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and
reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments
on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate
its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that
selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states
with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap. Demo
and code are available at: https://metadriverse.github.io/ppl

TL;DR: MIRA是一种无需训练、在推理时对齐扩散模型的方法，通过图像空间的KL约束来防止奖励黑客问题，在保持提示一致性的同时提高奖励分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的图像虽然符合文本提示，但往往无法满足用户特定的标量奖励标准（如美学评分）。现有的推理时对齐方法存在奖励黑客问题，即模型生成高评分但偏离原始提示的图像。

Method: 提出MIRA方法，引入基于分数的图像空间KL替代项，通过冻结骨干网络来正则化采样轨迹，约束输出分布，使奖励增加而不发生分布漂移。还提出了MIRA-DPO，将偏好优化映射到推理时间。

Result: 在SDv1.5和SDXL模型上，针对多种奖励（美学评分、HPSv2、PickScore）和公共数据集，MIRA相比强基线获得超过60%的胜率，同时保持提示一致性。机制图显示奖励增益接近零漂移，而DNO方法随着计算量增加而漂移。

Conclusion: MIRA有效解决了扩散模型推理时对齐中的奖励黑客问题，通过图像空间约束实现了奖励提升与提示一致性的平衡，为无需微调的对齐提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating images conditioned on text prompts, but
the resulting images often do not satisfy user-specific criteria measured by
scalar rewards such as Aesthetic Scores. This alignment typically requires
fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time
alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,
modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards
generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward
hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate
significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization
is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit
image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward
hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an
image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory
with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can
increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable
approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple
rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g.,
Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\% win rate vs. strong baselines while
preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero
drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases. We further introduce MIRA-DPO,
mapping preference optimization to inference time with a frozen backbone,
extending MIRA to non-differentiable rewards without fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法中KL散度正则化的实现存在混淆，有些方法将其作为数值估计系数而非优化损失函数，需要建立统一框架来分析不同实现方式的理论基础。

Method: 建立了统一分析框架，将KL正则化的两种实现方式（'kn in reward'和'kn as loss'）联系起来，通过梯度等价性分析证明它们的理论关系。

Result: 证明了'k1 in reward'是Reverse KL正则化的理论正确实现，'k2 as loss'在on-policy条件下与'k1 in reward'梯度等价，而'k3 as loss'是有偏的一阶近似。

Conclusion: 为KL正则化的选择和正确实现提供了基于梯度的理论依据，有助于构建更稳健有效的RLHF系统。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent
overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided
by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the
term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we
establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct
implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached
coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct
loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show
that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient
in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove
that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss
for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under
on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact,
gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our
work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL
objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like
in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss.
Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss'
methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a
principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based
rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the
way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.

TL;DR: 提出了Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD)框架，利用干预数据进行因果发现，通过建模总因果效应矩阵的似然，结合尖峰-平板马蹄先验和数据驱动的网络结构权重，实现不确定性感知的因果推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的因果发现方法在大规模任务上表现不佳，且无法量化不确定性。高通量基因组扰动筛选技术的发展促使需要利用干预数据改进模型识别能力。

Method: 采用经验贝叶斯框架，建模总因果效应矩阵的似然（近似矩阵正态分布），使用尖峰-平板马蹄先验对边进行建模，从观测数据中分别学习无标度和Erdős-Rényi结构的权重，将每条边作为潜变量进行不确定性感知推断。

Result: 通过广泛模拟实验，IBCD在结构恢复方面优于现有基线方法。应用于521个基因的CRISPR扰动数据，边缘后验包含概率能够识别稳健的图结构。

Conclusion: IBCD框架在因果发现中表现出优越性能，特别是在处理大规模干预数据和量化不确定性方面具有优势。

Abstract: Inferring the causal relationships among a set of variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) is an important but notoriously challenging
problem. Recently, advancements in high-throughput genomic perturbation screens
have inspired development of methods that leverage interventional data to
improve model identification. However, existing methods still suffer poor
performance on large-scale tasks and fail to quantify uncertainty. Here, we
propose Interventional Bayesian Causal Discovery (IBCD), an empirical Bayesian
framework for causal discovery with interventional data. Our approach models
the likelihood of the matrix of total causal effects, which can be approximated
by a matrix normal distribution, rather than the full data matrix. We place a
spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven
weights for scale-free and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi structures from observational
data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware
inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior
structure recovery compared to existing baselines. We apply IBCD to CRISPR
perturbation (Perturb-seq) data on 521 genes, demonstrating that edge posterior
inclusion probabilities enable identification of robust graph structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DiT服务系统使用固定程度的序列并行，对于混合分辨率和截止时间的异构工作负载效率低下，导致GPU利用率差和SLO达成率低。

Method: 提出步骤级序列并行策略，动态调整单个请求的并行度；设计TetriServe系统，采用轮次调度机制，包括时间离散化、步骤级并行度适配和联合请求打包。

Result: 在最先进的DiT模型上的广泛评估表明，TetriServe相比现有解决方案实现了高达32%的SLO达成率提升，且不降低图像质量。

Conclusion: TetriServe通过动态并行调度策略有效解决了DiT模型在严格SLO约束下的服务挑战，显著提升了系统效率和资源利用率。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images
through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level
Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost,
particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree
sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with
mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO
attainment.
  In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically
adjust the parallel degree of individual requests according to their deadlines.
We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for
highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel
round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation
on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher
SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.

Motivation: 探索RL是否能推动PLM超越其预训练先验，揭示序列-结构-功能关系的潜在规则，并评估RL在蛋白质设计中的采样效率和能力扩展。

Method: 在四个领域（抗菌肽设计、激酶变体优化、抗体工程和逆向折叠）中，将RL与PLM配对，使用多种RL算法和模型类别，分析任务改进空间、奖励保真度和策略容量的交互作用。

Result: RL在基准测试中持续提升成功率和采样效率。性能取决于任务改进空间、奖励保真度和策略容量的三因素交互：当奖励准确且信息丰富、策略容量充足且任务有改进空间时，改进显著；当奖励嘈杂或容量受限时，增益饱和。

Conclusion: 为蛋白质设计中的RL提供了实用指导：优先进行奖励建模和校准，再扩展策略规模；根据任务难度匹配算法和正则化强度；在边际收益最大的地方分配容量。

Abstract: Protein language models (PLMs) have advanced computational protein science
through large-scale pretraining and scalable architectures. In parallel,
reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise
multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs
beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function
rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four
domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody
engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model
classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it
reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL
consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a
three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity
jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies
have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines,
improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains
saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in
protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling
policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty,
and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest. Implementation is
available at https://github.com/chq1155/RL-PLM.

Motivation: 传统的梯度裁剪使用固定的硬阈值，缺乏灵活性且忽略了梯度分布的动态特性，限制了训练效果。

Method: SPAMP框架跟踪局部梯度统计，动态估计阈值，并应用基于幂的变换来以可微分方式调制更新幅度，将裁剪和预热重新定义为控制有效更新尺度的双重机制。

Result: 在图像和语言任务上的广泛实验表明，SPAMP在稳定性、收敛性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPAMP为刚性启发式方法提供了一个有原则的替代方案，通过统计感知的梯度整形显著改善了深度网络训练效果。

Abstract: Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its
formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient
distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive
Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into
smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics,
dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to
modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts
clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update
scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics.
Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP
improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.

one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems
that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning
(overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even
after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as
under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length
appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity
and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think
Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method
that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to
identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates
difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to
allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach
improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking
compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks
(AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute
accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8%
compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length
drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization:
although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and
efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH,
and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides
fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a
combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression
yields gains across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了NoRo框架，一种用于帕金森病远程监测中UPDRS评分预测的噪声鲁棒性方法，通过对比学习增强特征表示，提高在患者测量误差、环境噪声和数据包丢失等噪声条件下的预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病远程监测中存在的三种噪声（患者测量误差、环境噪声、数据传输丢失）会导致UPDRS评分预测误差增加，需要开发能够应对这些噪声的鲁棒性预测框架。

Method: 1. 基于选定特征的连续值将原始语音特征分组到有序区间；2. 构建对比对训练多层感知机编码器生成噪声鲁棒特征；3. 将鲁棒特征与原始特征拼接作为增强特征输入UPDRS预测模型；4. 引入可定制噪声注入模块进行评估。

Result: 广泛实验表明，NoRo能够成功增强UPDRS预测在不同噪声环境下的鲁棒性，在各种下游预测模型中都表现出良好的性能。

Conclusion: NoRo框架通过对比学习有效提升了帕金森病远程监测中UPDRS评分预测的噪声鲁棒性，为应对实际应用中的各种噪声挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
disorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling
self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types
of noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement
inaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during
transmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these
challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,
the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the
continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.
Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron
encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are
concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are
then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a
novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and
extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise
robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models
under different noisy environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用基于自旋转移力矩磁隧道结(STT-MTJs)的硬件真随机数生成器来增强生成式人工智能模型的安全性，相比传统伪随机数生成器可显著减少不安全输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式人工智能模型中使用的确定性伪随机数生成器会产生可预测模式，易受攻击者利用，而传统防御方法存在显著的能耗和延迟开销。

Method: 开发了基于STT-MTJs的硬件真随机数生成系统，使用FPGA辅助的高度并行计算架构，将硬件生成的随机比特集成到生成对抗网络中。

Result: 系统能以兆比特/秒的速度生成通过NIST随机性测试的真随机数，在CIFAR-10数据集上训练GAN时，相比低质量随机数生成器基线，不安全输出减少了18.6倍。

Conclusion: 基于STT-MTJ的系统具有纳秒级切换速度、高能效和良好可扩展性，有望扩展到106个并行单元，实现千兆比特/秒的吞吐量，适合大型语言模型采样，展示了自旋电子RNG作为下一代GAI系统实用安全组件的潜力。

Abstract: Deterministic pseudo random number generators (PRNGs) used in generative
artificial intelligence (GAI) models produce predictable patterns vulnerable to
exploitation by attackers. Conventional defences against the vulnerabilities
often come with significant energy and latency overhead. Here, we embed
hardware-generated true random bits from spin-transfer torque magnetic tunnel
junctions (STT-MTJs) to address the challenges. A highly parallel,
FPGA-assisted prototype computing system delivers megabit-per-second true
random numbers, passing NIST randomness tests after in-situ operations with
minimal overhead. Integrating the hardware random bits into a generative
adversarial network (GAN) trained on CIFAR-10 reduces insecure outputs by up to
18.6 times compared to the low-quality random number generators (RNG) baseline.
With nanosecond switching speed, high energy efficiency, and established
scalability, our STT-MTJ-based system holds the potential to scale beyond 106
parallel cells, achieving gigabit-per-second throughput suitable for large
language model sampling. This advancement highlights spintronic RNGs as
practical security components for next-generation GAI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解变分自编码器中后验坍塌现象的本质，揭示其不是简单的优化失败，而是数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的相变现象。

Method: 通过分析后验坍塌相关平凡解的稳定性，识别临界超参数阈值，并在合成和真实数据集上验证临界行为。

Result: 发现了将有意义潜在推断与坍塌分开的临界边界，该边界以近似后验与先验分布之间KL散度的不连续性为特征，证实了相变的存在。

Conclusion: 后验坍塌是一种由数据结构和变分约束相互作用产生的相变现象，这为深度生成模型的可训练性和表示能力提供了新见解。

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of posterior collapse in variational
autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective of statistical physics, and reveal
that it constitutes a phase transition governed jointly by data structure and
model hyper-parameters. By analyzing the stability of the trivial solution
associated with posterior collapse, we identify a critical hyper-parameter
threshold. This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from
collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the
approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical
behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of
a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not
merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising
from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints. This
perspective offers new insights into the trainability and representational
capacity of deep generative models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现SFT分数不能可靠预测后续RL训练效果，高SFT分数可能因数据简单或同质化而产生偏差，甚至导致RL后性能更差。提出了泛化损失和Pass@large k作为更好的RL效果预测指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前两阶段训练范式（SFT+RL）中高SFT分数能改善RL性能的假设，发现SFT分数存在偏差且不能可靠预测RL效果。

Method: 训练了数百个12B参数模型，使用SFT和GRPO算法进行RLVR训练，在7个数学基准测试上进行了256次重复实验，消耗超过100万GPU小时。

Result: 基于泛化损失和Pass@large k的预测方法比直接使用SFT分数预测RL效果更准确，R²系数和Spearman秩相关系数提高了0.5（2倍）。

Conclusion: SFT分数不是RL效果的良好预测指标，泛化损失和Pass@large k是更可靠的替代指标，这对实际应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current
state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as
``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to
improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this
is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more
homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or
scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models
with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome
compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and
identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k
performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds
of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive
evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU
hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple
state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL
performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves
substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for
broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on
unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two
epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training
only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often
leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying
lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

TL;DR: 大规模实证研究表明，在预训练数据中混合约30%的改写合成数据可以加速训练5-10倍，但纯合成数据训练效果较差，且不同合成数据类型对模型性能影响不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量训练数据对大型语言模型扩展至关重要但供应有限，合成数据技术有望突破这一限制，但需要系统评估其实际效果。

Method: 采用统一协议和缩放定律进行大规模实证研究（>1000个LLM，>10万GPU小时），比较自然网络数据、多种合成数据类型（改写文本、生成教科书）及其混合数据。

Result: 纯改写合成数据训练效果不优于自然网络文本；1/3改写合成数据+2/3自然网络文本混合可加速5-10倍；纯教科书风格合成数据训练导致下游任务损失显著增加；最佳合成数据比例约30%；更大生成模型不一定产生更好训练数据。

Conclusion: 合成数据在预训练中具有条件性优势，改写合成数据混合使用可显著加速训练，但纯合成数据训练存在风险，为合成数据应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling,
yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a
potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale
empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified
protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types
(rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic
data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data
\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while
pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts
can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets.
Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably
higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good"
ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and
data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data.
Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than
~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse"
during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic
data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance
in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style
pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our
work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional
benefits, and offers practical guidance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT)，通过可学习的门控机制动态路由token到三种几何注意力分支，解决了传统Transformer在非欧几里得数据上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer假设欧几里得几何，限制了在非欧几里得结构数据上的有效性。现有方法需要预先选择单一几何，缺乏灵活性。

Method: CAT使用轻量级可微分门控机制，动态学习每个token在三种几何注意力分支之间的路由，每个分支采用针对各自流形优化的几何特定操作。

Result: 在知识图谱补全基准测试中，CAT相比固定几何基线在MRR和Hits@10指标上提升约10%，仅增加5%参数且推理时间相当。

Conclusion: 学习几何适应优于任何单一固定几何，CAT为跨语言、视觉和多模态领域的混合几何架构提供了可扩展和可解释的基础。

Abstract: Transformers achieve strong performance across diverse domains but implicitly
assume Euclidean geometry in their attention mechanisms, limiting their
effectiveness on data with non-Euclidean structure. While recent extensions to
hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical
patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori,
reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We
introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that
dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches
through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry
approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to
the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The
routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch
employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On
knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves
approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines
with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These
results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single
fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable
and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across
language, vision, and multimodal domains.

Result: 在开源LLM上评估了多种编辑场景，展示了在编辑定位方面的强大实证性能。

Conclusion: 提出的组合水印方法能够有效检测和定位LLM输出中的后生成编辑，为保护AI生成内容的完整性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking has become a key technique for proprietary language models,
enabling the distinction between AI-generated and human-written text. However,
in many real-world scenarios, LLM-generated content may undergo post-generation
edits, such as human revisions or even spoofing attacks, making it critical to
detect and localize such modifications. In this work, we introduce a new task:
detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To
this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework,
which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark
by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during
generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic
that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight
local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two
task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and
evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios,
demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.

Motivation: 现有子二次注意力近似算法需要输入有界，但实践中LLM的查询和键矩阵通常不满足此假设，限制了应用。

Method: 利用查询和键矩阵的次高斯特性，将大值和小值分离，稀疏部分精确计算，稠密部分用多项式近似，并扩展到多阈值设置消除分布假设。

Result: 实现了子二次运行时间，为多项式注意力的经验成功提供了首个理论证明，展示了softmax注意力可通过多个带草图的多项式注意力组合来近似。

Conclusion: 支持基分解框架突破了有界输入限制，为高效注意力近似提供了理论基础，扩展了子二次注意力算法在实践LLM中的应用范围。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of softmax attention remains a central bottleneck in
scaling large language models (LLMs). [Alman and Song, NeurIPS 2023] proposed a
sub-quadratic attention approximation algorithm, but it works only under the
restrictive bounded-entry assumption. Since this assumption rarely holds in
practice, its applicability to modern LLMs is limited.
  In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for
efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically
demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian
behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries,
enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on
dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a
sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that
eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first
theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention
[Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be
closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with
sketching.

Conclusion: REFEREE方法在无源跨域持续学习场景中表现出色，成功解决了域偏移、噪声伪标签和灾难性遗忘等问题。

Abstract: Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification
is performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the
random kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of
our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples
with significant margins.

Motivation: 传统神经网络剪枝方法在达到50-60%稀疏度时就会严重损害模型精度，无法突破极端稀疏度的瓶颈，这限制了大型语言模型的计算和内存效率提升。

Method: 使用基于ADMM的标准约束优化技术，直接解决现有方法依赖代理目标函数的局限性，并提出量化变体Elsa-L以扩展到超大型模型。

Conclusion: Elsa方法在推进LLM稀疏度前沿方面取得了有意义的进展，表明在有限探索方向上仍有显著的进一步改进机会。

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a promising technique to mitigate the excessive
computational and memory requirements of large language models (LLMs). Despite
its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional
methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%)
without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current
impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\texttt{Elsa}$,
which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model
fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice,
all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective
formulation. $\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via
standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on
ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show
that $\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods;
e.g., it achieves 7.8$\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on
LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present
$\texttt{Elsa}_{\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large
models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees. These
results highlight meaningful progress in advancing the frontier of LLM
sparsity, while promising that significant opportunities for further
advancement may remain in directions that have so far attracted limited
exploration.

TL;DR: AsyPPO是一种用于大语言模型强化学习的创新架构，通过使用轻量级mini-critics集合来恢复评论家角色，解决了传统价值函数在大模型规模下的计算瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL4LLM方法避免使用显式评论家，主要因为传统价值函数在大模型规模下计算成本高，且在稀疏奖励和长推理视野下容易失效。

Method: AsyPPO采用一组轻量级mini-critics，每个在不相交的提示分片上训练，鼓励多样性同时保持校准。利用评论家间的不确定性来优化策略更新：屏蔽评论家一致状态的优势值，过滤高分歧状态以避免虚假探索。

Result: 在仅5000个样本的开源数据上训练后，AsyPPO在多个基准测试中持续提升学习稳定性和性能，相比经典PPO在Qwen3-4b-Base上获得超过6%的性能提升，在Qwen3-8b-Base和Qwen3-14b-Base上获得约3%的提升。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了架构创新对于可扩展、高效算法的重要性，AsyPPO成功解决了大语言模型强化学习中的价值估计偏差问题。

Abstract: Most recent RL for LLMs (RL4LLM) methods avoid explicit critics, replacing
them with average advantage baselines. This shift is largely pragmatic:
conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM
scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We
revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce
Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable
framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in
large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each
trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while
preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust
estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy
update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add
little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy
regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source
data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability
and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO,
achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about
three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without
additional tricks. These results highlight the importance of architectural
innovations for scalable, efficient algorithms.

Motivation: 旨在通过平衡嵌入空间的均匀性和容忍度特性来学习强健的时间序列表示，以更好地捕捉时间序列中的实例级和时间依赖性信息。

Method: 使用层次化设置学习实例级和时间信息；在对比损失中集成温度调度器来平衡均匀性和容忍度；采用层次化角度边界损失在正负时间序列对之间创建几何边界。

Result: 在128个UCR和30个UAE数据集上的分类任务中显著优于现有方法，在Yahoo和KPI数据集上的异常检测任务中获得有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: TimeHUT通过层次化均匀性-容忍度平衡策略有效提升了时间序列表示学习性能，在分类任务上表现突出，并通过敏感性分析和消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Abstract: We propose TimeHUT, a novel method for learning time-series representations
by hierarchical uniformity-tolerance balancing of contrastive representations.
Our method uses two distinct losses to learn strong representations with the
aim of striking an effective balance between uniformity and tolerance in the
embedding space. First, TimeHUT uses a hierarchical setup to learn both
instance-wise and temporal information from input time-series. Next, we
integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to
balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings.
Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and
temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and
negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of
positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture
of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach
on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and
multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly
detection. The results demonstrate that TimeHUT outperforms prior methods by
considerable margins on classification, while obtaining competitive results for
anomaly detection. Finally, detailed sensitivity and ablation studies are
performed to evaluate different components and hyperparameters of our method.

*Wangxuan Fan,Ching Wang,Siqi Li,Nan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ShapKAN剪枝框架，使用Shapley值评估KAN网络中节点重要性，解决了传统基于幅度的剪枝方法对输入坐标偏移敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KAN网络虽然能恢复符号表示，但其架构对传统剪枝方法提出了挑战，特别是基于幅度的剪枝方法因对输入坐标偏移敏感而不可靠。

Method: 使用Shapley值归因来评估节点重要性，以平移不变的方式量化每个节点的实际贡献，确保重要性排名不受输入参数化影响。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，ShapKAN能够保持真实节点重要性，同时实现有效的网络压缩。

Conclusion: ShapKAN提高了KAN的可解释性优势，促进了在资源受限环境中的部署。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships
is as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural
networks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying
functional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by
employing learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling
recovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.
However, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.
Conventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to
input coordinate shifts. We propose \textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using
Shapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant
manner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's
actual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of
input parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling
effective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability
advantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.

### [200] [Beyond Simple Fusion: Adaptive Gated Fusion for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01677)
*Han Wu,Yanming Sun,Yunhe Yang,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应门控融合网络(AGFN)，通过基于信息熵和模态重要性的双门融合机制自适应调整特征权重，以解决多模态情感分析中模态质量变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的简单融合技术无法处理模态质量变化（如噪声、缺失或语义冲突），导致在识别细微情感时性能不佳。

Method: 采用双门融合机制，基于信息熵和模态重要性自适应调整特征权重，减少噪声模态的影响并优先考虑信息丰富的线索。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上的实验表明，AGFN在准确率上显著优于强基线，能有效识别细微情感且性能稳健。

Conclusion: AGFN通过减少特征位置与预测误差之间的相关性，从更广泛的特征分布中学习，增强了泛化能力，创建了更稳健的多模态特征表示。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse
modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.
However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in
modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically
conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in
discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce
a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion
\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion
mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism
mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues
following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on
CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong
baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust
performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates
that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature
distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and
prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and
creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

*Juncheng Dong,Weibin Mo,Zhengling Qi,Cong Shi,Ethan X. Fang,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于悲观原则的离线数据驱动分类优化框架PASTA，在数据覆盖不足的情况下实现最优预期收益，并在多种选择模型下建立了首个有限样本遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分类优化问题中由于数据覆盖不足导致的挑战，传统方法需要完整覆盖所有可行分类，而实际数据往往无法满足这一要求。

Method: 引入悲观分类优化(PASTA)框架，仅要求离线数据分布包含最优分类，而不需要提供所有可行分类的完整覆盖。

Result: 在多项logit和嵌套logit等广泛使用的选择模型中建立了首个有限样本遗憾界，证明了PASTA在样本和模型复杂度方面的极小极大最优性。

Conclusion: PASTA框架在数据覆盖不足的情况下有效解决了分类优化问题，数值实验表明其优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: We study a broad class of assortment optimization problems in an offline and
data-driven setting. In such problems, a firm lacks prior knowledge of the
underlying choice model, and aims to determine an optimal assortment based on
historical customer choice data. The combinatorial nature of assortment
optimization often results in insufficient data coverage, posing a significant
challenge in designing provably effective solutions. To address this, we
introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that
leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under
general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data
distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full
coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first
finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several
widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit
models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that
PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baseline
approaches.

### [202] [Representational Alignment Across Model Layers and Brain Regions with Hierarchical Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01706)
*Shaan Shah,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层最优传输（HOT）框架，通过全局优化解决神经网络表示对齐问题，能够处理不同深度网络的比较，提供统一的网络对齐评分和软传输计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准表示相似性方法存在局限性：独立对齐每层导致不对称结果、缺乏全局对齐评分、难以处理不同深度网络。这些问题源于忽略了全局激活结构和限制于刚性的一对一层对应关系。

Method: HOT框架联合推断软性、全局一致的层到层耦合和神经元级传输计划，允许源神经元在多个目标层之间分配质量，在边际约束下最小化总传输成本。

Result: 在视觉模型、大语言模型和人类视觉皮层记录上的评估显示，HOT在比对质量上匹配或超越标准成对匹配方法，并揭示了平滑、细粒度的分层对应关系。

Conclusion: HOT能够实现更丰富、更可解释的表示比较，特别适用于架构或深度不同的网络比较，通过全局优化自然产生结构化模式。

Abstract: Standard representational similarity methods align each layer of a network to
its best match in another independently, producing asymmetric results, lacking
a global alignment score, and struggling with networks of different depths.
These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and
restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose
Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers
soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport
plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target
layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This
yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a
soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass
distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and
human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses
standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth,
fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers,
deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by
distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns
emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent
in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable
comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in
architecture or depth.

### [203] [ActiNet: Activity intensity classification of wrist-worn accelerometers using self-supervised deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01712)
*Aidan Acquah,Shing Chan,Aiden Doherty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合自监督学习和隐马尔可夫模型的活动强度识别方法ActiNet，在手腕加速度计数据分析中表现优于传统随机森林方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模流行病学研究中，需要可靠准确的人类活动识别模型来分析手腕加速度计数据，以研究体力活动与健康结果之间的关系。自监督学习在改进人类活动识别方面具有潜力，但其与隐马尔可夫模型结合的实际效果尚不明确。

Method: 使用151名CAPTURE-24参与者的数据，训练ActiNet模型（一个自监督、18层改进的ResNet-V2模型），然后应用隐马尔可夫模型平滑来分类活动强度标签。通过5折分层组交叉验证评估性能，并与文献中建立的基线随机森林+HMM方法进行比较。

Result: ActiNet模型能够以平均宏观F1分数0.82和平均Cohen's kappa分数0.86区分活动强度标签，超过了在同一数据集上训练和验证的RF+HMM方法的性能（平均分数分别为0.77和0.81）。这些发现在不同年龄和性别的亚组中保持一致。

Conclusion: 这些发现鼓励在未来的流行病学研究中使用ActiNet从手腕加速度计数据中提取活动强度标签。

Abstract: The use of reliable and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) models on
passively collected wrist-accelerometer data is essential in large-scale
epidemiological studies that investigate the association between physical
activity and health outcomes. While the use of self-supervised learning has
generated considerable excitement in improving HAR, it remains unknown the
extent to which these models, coupled with hidden Markov models (HMMs), would
make a tangible improvement to classification performance, and the effect this
may have on the predicted daily activity intensity compositions. Using 151
CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised,
18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM)
smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this
model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then
compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing
literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared
with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The
ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean
macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the
performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with
mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent
across subgroups of age and sex. These findings encourage the use of ActiNet
for the extraction of activity intensity labels from wrist-accelerometer data
in future epidemiological studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用无人机进行多模态数据收集和模型训练，克服单模态系统的局限性，提高模型精度和泛化能力，同时优化联邦学习系统的延迟问题。

Method: 采用块坐标下降和逐次凸逼近相结合的迭代优化算法，解决延迟最小化问题的计算复杂度，并提供非凸损失函数下的理论收敛分析。

Result: 数值实验表明，该框架在不同数据设置下，在系统延迟和模型训练性能方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 无人机辅助的联邦多模态学习框架能有效降低系统延迟并提升模型性能，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and
providing convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed
throughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and
collaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing
multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,
enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive
understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML
system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,
power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource
management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization
problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining
block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which
provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical
convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss
function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms
existing approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance
under different data settings.

*Jialin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BD Attention (BDA) 是首个无损的注意力算法重构，通过基础分解矩阵恒等式实现，无需重新训练即可在GPU上加速32%的键值投影并减少25%权重，对模型性能影响可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力是大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的核心操作，现有优化如FlashAttention主要关注I/O层面的系统优化，缺乏数学上保证的无损算法级加速方法。

Method: 基于基础分解的矩阵恒等式，将多头投影重新结构化为紧凑形式，保持精确输出。该方法架构无关，仅需4秒离线准备。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V2-Lite模型上，BDA实现32%更快的键值投影、25%更小的权重，端到端困惑度仅增加0.02%(FP16)或0.0004%(FP32)，性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: BDA是首个理论上精确的无损注意力加速方法，与现有工程级优化互补，为注意力机制提供了数学保证的加速方案。

Abstract: Attention is a core operation in large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs). We present BD Attention (BDA), the first
lossless algorithmic reformulation of attention. BDA is enabled by a simple
matrix identity from Basis Decomposition (BD), which restructures multi-head
projections into a compact form while preserving exact outputs. Unlike
I/O-aware system optimizations such as FlashAttention, BDA provides a
mathematically guaranteed acceleration that is architecture-agnostic. On
DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with
no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value
projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity
(PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model
performance. These results position BDA as the first theoretically exact method
for lossless attention acceleration that is complementary to existing
engineering-level optimizations. Our code is available at

### [206] [Finite-Time Bounds for Distributionally Robust TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01721)
*Saptarshi Mandal,Yashaswini Murthy,R. Srikant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了首个使用线性函数逼近的鲁棒TD学习算法，能够在总变差距离和Wasserstein距离不确定性集下实现鲁棒策略评估，无需模型或生成器访问，样本复杂度为Õ(1/ε²)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有鲁棒TD学习的收敛保证仅限于表格MDP或依赖于限制性折扣因子假设，需要填补鲁棒RL算法实证成功与理论保证之间的关键差距。

Method: 结合双时间尺度随机逼近更新和外循环目标网络更新，在总变差距离和Wasserstein距离不确定性集下进行鲁棒TD学习。

Result: 实现了Õ(1/ε²)的样本复杂度以获得ε-精确值估计，填补了鲁棒RL算法与非鲁棒对应物之间的理论差距。

Conclusion: 该算法是首个使用线性函数逼近的鲁棒TD学习，方法可轻松扩展到带函数逼近的鲁棒Q学习。

Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DRRL) focuses on designing
policies that achieve good performance under model uncertainties. In
particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted
reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed
environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty
set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD)
learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on
restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We
present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where
robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and
Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both
model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm
combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop
target-network update. We establish an $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample
complexity to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a
key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the
non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key
ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to
robust Q-learning with function approximation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出使用深度神经网络(DNN)替代传统离散选择模型(DCM)来建模工作地点选择，DNN在某些方面表现优于DCM，但两种模型各有优势，应根据具体应用需求选择合适的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散选择模型在准确反映个体决策过程方面存在挑战，需要探索更有效的方法来理解复杂的工作地点选择决策模式。

Method: 使用深度神经网络(DNN)方法建模工作地点选择，并与传统离散选择模型(DCM)进行对比分析。

Result: DNN在工作地点选择建模中显示出作为DCM的强有力替代方案的潜力。两种模型都能有效复制工作机会的影响，但DNN在某些方面表现更好，而DCM在评估个体属性对工作距离的影响时与数据更吻合。DCM在短距离表现更优，DNN在长距离表现与DCM相当。

Conclusion: 在工作地点选择分析中，应根据具体应用需求选择合适的模型，DNN和DCM各有优势，需要权衡使用。

Abstract: Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace
location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual
decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN)
method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand
complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete
choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant
potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models
effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location
choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM
better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes
on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs
perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings
underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific
application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私随机梯度下降（DPSGD）对模型公平性的影响，发现直接优化差分隐私模型的超参数虽然不能可靠地减轻DPSGD的不均衡影响，但相比重用非隐私模型的超参数，能带来更好的效用-公平性权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究DPSGD对模型公平性的影响，验证直接优化差分隐私模型超参数是否能改善公平性，而非简单地重用非隐私模型的超参数。

Method: 通过比较DPSGD对不同性能指标的不均衡影响，并在广泛的超参数设置下进行分析，同时评估DPSGD-Global-Adapt变体的效果。

Result: DPSGD对不同指标的不均衡影响并不一致；直接优化差分隐私模型超参数不能可靠减轻不均衡影响，但能改善效用-公平性权衡；DPSGD-Global-Adapt在超参数选择方面不够鲁棒。

Conclusion: 超参数调优会带来额外的隐私泄露，需要在隐私、效用和公平性之间仔细权衡；直接优化差分隐私模型超参数是改善效用-公平性权衡的有效方法，但不能完全解决DPSGD的不均衡影响问题。

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method for protecting information
about individuals during data analysis. Training neural networks with
differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the
model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the
model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic
report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that
fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing
hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models
(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common
practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1)
comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and
2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that
a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact
on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters
directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate
impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness
trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We
stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional
privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,
utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a
variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and
conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to
hyperparameter choice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务中的潜在表征常受噪声和无关特征影响，这会降低模型性能和泛化能力。

Method: 使用无监督动态特征选择，为每个实例识别并移除图像中的误导或冗余信息，仅保留最相关特征。

Result: 在图像数据集上的实验表明，配备无监督DFS的模型在聚类和图像生成等任务中显著提高了泛化性能，计算成本增加极小。

Conclusion: 无监督动态特征选择能有效增强潜在表征，提高模型性能，且无需依赖标注数据，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of
machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a
compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations
are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the
model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a
novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic
Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and
removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the
most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an
unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it
broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted
on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS
achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various
tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal
increase in the computational cost.

Motivation: 强化学习研究需要多样化、具有挑战性且可扩展的环境。现代视频游戏虽然动态丰富，但计算成本高且不适合大规模实验。需要提供GPU加速的替代方案来替代CPU绑定的传统环境。

Conclusion: Octax为JAX社区提供了期待已久的GPU端到端Atari基准替代方案，其模块化设计使研究人员能够轻松扩展套件或使用大语言模型生成新环境，是理想的大规模强化学习实验平台。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) research requires diverse, challenging
environments that are both tractable and scalable. While modern video games may
offer rich dynamics, they are computationally expensive and poorly suited for
large-scale experimentation due to their CPU-bound execution. We introduce
Octax, a high-performance suite of classic arcade game environments implemented
in JAX, based on CHIP-8 emulation, a predecessor to Atari, which is widely
adopted as a benchmark in RL research. Octax provides the JAX community with a
long-awaited end-to-end GPU alternative to the Atari benchmark, offering
image-based environments, spanning puzzle, action, and strategy genres, all
executable at massive scale on modern GPUs. Our JAX-based implementation
achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional CPU emulators while
maintaining perfect fidelity to the original game mechanics. We demonstrate
Octax's capabilities by training RL agents across multiple games, showing
significant improvements in training speed and scalability compared to existing
solutions. The environment's modular design enables researchers to easily
extend the suite with new games or generate novel environments using large
language models, making it an ideal platform for large-scale RL
experimentation.

Conclusion: 提出的训练策略有效解决了非规范哈密顿动力学学习中的数值不稳定性问题，能够进行长期稳定的动力学模拟。

Abstract: This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data,
where long-term predictions require the preservation of structure both in the
learned model and in numerical schemes. Previous research focused on either
facet, respectively with a potential-based architecture and with degenerate
variational integrators, but new issues arise when combining both. In
experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test
cases assess the ability of the methods to learn complex physical dynamics,
like the guiding center from gyrokinetic plasma physics.

Motivation: 验证后处理隐私过滤技术在医学AI研究中生成隐私保护合成数据集的有效性，这些技术声称能移除包含个人身份信息的样本但效果未经充分验证。

Method: 对胸部X光合成应用过滤管道进行严格评估，分析过滤器在检测真实图像和训练数据生成的近重复样本方面的表现。

Result: 当前过滤器表现出有限的特异性和一致性，仅对真实图像实现高敏感性，但无法可靠检测从训练数据生成的近重复样本。

Conclusion: 后处理过滤存在关键局限性，无法有效保护患者隐私反而可能提供虚假安全感，需要在过滤器设计方面取得实质性进展才能用于敏感应用。

Abstract: The generation of privacy-preserving synthetic datasets is a promising avenue
for overcoming data scarcity in medical AI research. Post-hoc privacy filtering
techniques, designed to remove samples containing personally identifiable
information, have recently been proposed as a solution. However, their
effectiveness remains largely unverified. This work presents a rigorous
evaluation of a filtering pipeline applied to chest X-ray synthesis. Contrary
to claims from the original publications, our results demonstrate that current
filters exhibit limited specificity and consistency, achieving high sensitivity
only for real images while failing to reliably detect near-duplicates generated
from training data. These results demonstrate a critical limitation of post-hoc
filtering: rather than effectively safeguarding patient privacy, these methods
may provide a false sense of security while leaving unacceptable levels of
patient information exposed. We conclude that substantial advances in filter
design are needed before these methods can be confidently deployed in sensitive
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Granular-GRPO框架，通过奇异随机采样策略和多粒度优势集成模块，解决了现有方法在流模型强化学习中奖励信号稀疏和狭窄的问题，实现了更精确全面的采样方向评估。

Motivation: 现有方法在探索高价值样本方面有效，但由于稀疏和狭窄的奖励信号，导致偏好对齐效果不佳。

Method: 1. 奇异随机采样策略：支持逐步随机探索，同时强制奖励与注入噪声之间的高相关性；2. 多粒度优势集成模块：聚合多个扩散尺度的优势计算，产生更全面稳健的采样方向评估。

Result: 在各种奖励模型上的实验表明，G²RPO显著优于现有的基于流的GRPO基线方法。

Conclusion: G²RPO框架在流模型的强化学习中实现了更精确和全面的奖励评估，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow
models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative
models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential
Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse
denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively
explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference
alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves
precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in
reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic
Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration
while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,
thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,
to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages
computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and
robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various
reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,
demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing
flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种宽-窄-宽（沙漏型）MLP块结构，挑战了传统的窄-宽-窄MLP设计范式。沙漏型MLP在扩展维度上进行跳跃连接，而残差计算通过窄瓶颈流动，实现了在保持计算效率的同时利用高维空间进行增量精化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统MLP的窄-宽-窄设计范式，探索跳跃连接在扩展维度而非输入/输出维度上操作的新架构，以提升模型性能同时保持计算效率。

Method: 提出沙漏型MLP块结构，其中跳跃连接在扩展维度操作，残差计算通过窄瓶颈流动。使用随机初始化的固定投影将输入信号提升到扩展维度，并保持该投影在训练过程中不变。通过系统架构搜索评估生成任务上的性能-参数帕累托边界。

Result: 沙漏型架构在多个流行图像数据集的生成任务上始终优于传统设计，获得更优的帕累托边界。随着参数预算增加，最优沙漏配置倾向于更深的网络、更宽的跳跃连接和更窄的瓶颈，这与传统MLP的缩放模式不同。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明需要重新考虑现代架构中跳跃连接的位置，这一发现可能扩展到Transformer和其他残差网络。

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) conventionally follow a narrow-wide-narrow
design where skip connections operate at the input/output dimensions while
processing occurs in expanded hidden spaces. We challenge this convention by
proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections
operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow
bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental
refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched
designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift
input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can
remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient
training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on
generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing
performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search.
Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto
frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase,
optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip
connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from
conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement
in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers
and other residual networks.

### [216] [Sparse Query Attention (SQA): A Computationally Efficient Attention Mechanism with Query Heads Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01817)
*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出稀疏查询注意力(SQA)架构，通过减少查询头数量来降低注意力机制的计算复杂度，在长序列处理中实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer中多头注意力机制的二次计算复杂度问题，特别是在长上下文应用中。现有方法如MQA和GQA虽然解决了内存带宽瓶颈，但未减少注意力分数计算的基本FLOPs。

Method: 提出SQA架构，通过减少查询头数量来直接降低注意力计算复杂度，而不是像传统方法那样减少键/值头。

Result: 在32k-200k令牌的长序列基准测试中，SQA在计算密集型场景（如预训练、微调和编码器任务）中实现高达3倍的吞吐量提升，且对模型质量影响极小。

Conclusion: SQA是构建更高效和可扩展模型的强大工具，在开发Reactive Transformer架构时偶然发现，具有重要潜力。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA)
mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in
artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA
with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling,
particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions,
such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have
effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates
autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While
highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of
floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation,
which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing.
This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention
architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path.
Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads.
This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity
of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query
heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical
foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural
variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate
that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in
computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and
encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary
smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the
development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its
potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

TL;DR: 提出了一种顺序不变强化学习框架用于黑盒组合优化，通过随机生成顺序训练多变量自回归生成模型，提高样本效率和搜索空间多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布估计算法依赖学习显式变量依赖图，成本高且难以有效捕捉复杂交互。需要一种更高效的方法来处理组合优化问题。

Method: 使用无固定变量顺序的多变量自回归生成模型，在训练中采样随机生成顺序（信息保留dropout），使模型对变量顺序不变，并采用GRPO进行稳定的策略梯度更新。

Result: 在多种基准算法和不同规模问题实例上，该方法经常获得最佳性能，并始终避免灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 该方法通过顺序不变性提高了组合优化的样本效率和性能，在广泛问题上表现出色且稳定。

Abstract: We introduce an order-invariant reinforcement learning framework for
black-box combinatorial optimization. Classical estimation-of-distribution
algorithms (EDAs) often rely on learning explicit variable dependency graphs,
which can be costly and fail to capture complex interactions efficiently. In
contrast, we parameterize a multivariate autoregressive generative model
trained without a fixed variable ordering. By sampling random generation orders
during training - a form of information-preserving dropout - the model is
encouraged to be invariant to variable order, promoting search-space diversity
and shaping the model to focus on the most relevant variable dependencies,
improving sample efficiency. We adapt Generalized Reinforcement Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to this setting, providing stable policy-gradient updates
from scale-invariant advantages. Across a wide range of benchmark algorithms
and problem instances of varying sizes, our method frequently achieves the best
performance and consistently avoids catastrophic failures.

Conclusion: APS方法有效克服了现有离散扩散后验采样方法的局限性，为基于预训练离散扩散模型的后验采样提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete
diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements
without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous
Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework
for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond
unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and
principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited
for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion
posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields
sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs
samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked
diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized
expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and
anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear
and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further
demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and
text-guided editing.

Motivation: AutoML领域在事后模型选择方面取得了显著进展，但现有方法通常依赖耗尽的超参数搜索。预选预测作为一种有前景的替代方案，能够通过智能预选模型来绕过耗尽搜索，但在文献中仍未被充分探索。

Result: 提出的方法显著减少了AutoML工作流程的计算开销，同时仍然能够为给定数据集选择最佳模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为AutoML工作流程提供了转变，通过智能预选有效平衡了计算效率与模型性能。

Abstract: The field of AutoML has made remarkable progress in post-hoc model selection,
with libraries capable of automatically identifying the most performing models
for a given dataset. Nevertheless, these methods often rely on exhaustive
hyperparameter searches, where methods automatically train and test different
types of models on the target dataset. Contrastingly, pre-hoc prediction
emerges as a promising alternative, capable of bypassing exhaustive search
through intelligent pre-selection of models. Despite its potential, pre-hoc
prediction remains under-explored in the literature. This paper explores the
intersection of AutoML and pre-hoc model selection by leveraging traditional
models and Large Language Model (LLM) agents to reduce the search space of
AutoML libraries. By relying on dataset descriptions and statistical
information, we reduce the AutoML search space. Our methodology is applied to
the AWS AutoGluon portfolio dataset, a state-of-the-art AutoML benchmark
containing 175 tabular classification datasets available on OpenML. The
proposed approach offers a shift in AutoML workflows, significantly reducing
computational overhead, while still selecting the best model for the given
dataset.

Method: CNS方法独特识别扩散模型中与目标概念相关的神经元，以增量方式微调这些概念神经元，并联合保留先前概念的知识。

Result: 在真实数据集上的评估显示，CNS以最少的参数调整实现了最先进的性能，在单概念和多概念个性化任务中均优于先前方法，且无需融合操作，减少了持续个性化的内存存储和处理时间。

Conclusion: CNS是一种简单有效的持续学习方法，能够在增量设置中成功进行个性化，同时保持扩散模型的零样本生成能力。

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in
real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel
learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective
approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS
uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the
target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while
preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept
neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of
previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS
achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,
outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization
works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and
processing time for continual personalization.

Motivation: 虽然深度学习在安全关键系统验证中显示出潜力，但表示学习在形式验证领域仍未充分探索。

Method: 通过自监督对比目标，将逻辑规范和系统共同嵌入到共享潜在空间中。

Result: 在行业启发的检索任务中，CNML在跨模态和模态内设置下显著优于算法和神经基线方法。学习到的表示能有效迁移到下游任务并泛化到更复杂的公式。

Conclusion: 模型检查可以作为学习形式语言表示的目标函数，为形式验证领域开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Model checking is a key technique for verifying safety-critical systems
against formal specifications, where recent applications of deep learning have
shown promise. However, while ubiquitous for vision and language domains,
representation learning remains underexplored in formal verification. We
introduce Contrastive Neural Model Checking (CNML), a novel method that
leverages the model checking task as a guiding signal for learning aligned
representations. CNML jointly embeds logical specifications and systems into a
shared latent space through a self-supervised contrastive objective. On
industry-inspired retrieval tasks, CNML considerably outperforms both
algorithmic and neural baselines in cross-modal and intra-modal settings.We
further show that the learned representations effectively transfer to
downstream tasks and generalize to more complex formulas. These findings
demonstrate that model checking can serve as an objective for learning
representations for formal languages.

Motivation: 传统扩散和基于流的生成模型使用非平衡、时间条件动力学，EqM旨在通过平衡动力学视角改进生成建模。

Method: 丢弃传统模型的时间条件动力学，学习隐式能量景观的平衡梯度，在推理时采用基于梯度下降的优化采样过程，支持可调步长、自适应优化器和自适应计算。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上FID达到1.90，超越了扩散/流模型的生成性能，并能处理部分噪声图像去噪、OOD检测和图像合成等任务。

Conclusion: EqM通过用统一平衡景观替代时间条件速度，在流模型和基于能量的模型之间建立了更紧密的桥梁，为优化驱动推理提供了简单途径。

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework
built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the
non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and
flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an
implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an
optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are
obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step
sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation
performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on
ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and
sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework
that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD
detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with
a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and
energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Result: 在顶夸克标记和一系列动态系统上，LieNLSD相比现有方法具有定性优势，将神经PDE求解器的长程滚动精度提高了20%以上，同时指导数据增强。

Conclusion: LieNLSD是首个能够确定非线性项无穷小生成元数量及其显式表达式的方法，在对称性发现方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Symmetry is widely applied in problems such as the design of equivariant
networks and the discovery of governing equations, but in complex scenarios, it
is not known in advance. Most previous symmetry discovery methods are limited
to linear symmetries, and recent attempts to discover nonlinear symmetries fail
to explicitly get the Lie algebra subspace. In this paper, we propose LieNLSD,
which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number
of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit
expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action
and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation
formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear
with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences
of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the
infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the
coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging
and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over
existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers
by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/hulx2002/LieNLSD.

Conclusion: 该框架结合了神经网络的表达能力和概率推理的数据效率，实现了快速组合式元学习

Abstract: To solve a new task from minimal experience, it is essential to effectively
reuse knowledge from previous tasks, a problem known as meta-learning.
Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly
recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for
meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that
explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable
computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the
underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks.
This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference
problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through
highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground
truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We
then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single
examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks
with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid
compositional meta-learning.

Conclusion: 梯度空间分析揭示了核心子空间影响力随时间减弱的动态特性，提出的随机算法成功利用了子空间特性，在大模型训练中实现了内存效率和性能的双重提升。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) is often bottlenecked by extreme memory
demands, with optimizer states dominating the footprint. Recent works mitigates
this cost by projecting gradients into low-dimensional subspaces using
sophisticated update strategies. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of
gradient space and its underlying subspaces. We find that while a small
subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in
the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over
time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits
near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this
geometry. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a suite of randomized
algorithms, GrassWalk and GrassJump, which exploit subspace and achieve
state-of-the-art memory savings while improving performance on LLaMA-1B and
LLaMA-7B pretraining.

Motivation: 许多自然动态过程（如细胞分化、疾病进展）只能通过静态样本快照观察，重建其时间演化对科学研究至关重要。现有方法在维度扩展性和假设限制方面存在不足。

Method: 扩展了Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Matching，推导出迭代马尔可夫拟合算法，以因子化方式处理多边际问题。

Conclusion: 多边际Schrödinger桥是恢复静态数据中隐藏动态的实用且原则性方法。

Abstract: Many natural dynamic processes -- such as in vivo cellular differentiation or
disease progression -- can only be observed through the lens of static sample
snapshots. While challenging, reconstructing their temporal evolution to
decipher underlying dynamic properties is of major interest to scientific
research. Existing approaches enable data transport along a temporal axis but
are poorly scalable in high dimension and require restrictive assumptions to be
met. To address these issues, we propose \textit{\textbf{Multi-Marginal
temporal Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching}} (\textbf{MMtSBM}) \textit{for video
generation from unpaired data}, extending the theoretical guarantees and
empirical efficiency of Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridge Matching
(arXiv:archive/2303.16852) by deriving the Iterative Markovian Fitting
algorithm to multiple marginals in a novel factorized fashion. Experiments show
that MMtSBM retains theoretical properties on toy examples, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real world datasets such as transcriptomic
trajectory inference in 100 dimensions, and for the first time recovers
couplings and dynamics in very high dimensional image settings. Our work
establishes multi-marginal Schr\"odinger bridges as a practical and principled

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统诊断模型孤立分析不同医疗数据源，无法捕捉跨模态相关性，限制了早期疾病诊断能力。

Method: 使用基于注意力的Transformer框架，通过专用编码器将各模态映射到共享潜在空间，结合多头注意力和残差归一化进行多模态融合，支持多任务预训练。

Abstract: Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health
records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable
devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in
isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations
essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal
foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early
detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management
tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,
reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a
single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the
accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.

TL;DR: 本文探索了Tsetlin Machine在大规模多通道图像分类中的应用，提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法，在MNIST和CelebA数据集上取得了与深度学习模型相当的性能，同时保持了模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tsetlin Machine是一种基于有限状态自动机和命题逻辑的新型机器学习范式，相比神经网络具有更好的可解释性。本文旨在探索TM架构在大规模多通道图像分类中的适用性。

Method: 提出了生成局部解释和全局类别表示的方法论。局部解释用于解释模型预测，全局类别表示聚合每个类别的重要模式。这些解释总结了卷积子句捕获的知识，可以可视化为图像。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上达到98.5%准确率，在CelebA数据集上达到86.56% F1分数（相比ResNet50的88.07%）。TM在保持可解释性的同时，性能与深度学习模型相当。

Conclusion: TM在大规模复杂训练环境中能够保持竞争力，同时维持其可解释性。这有助于更好地理解TM子句，并为将模型应用于更复杂多样的数据集提供了见解。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a novel machine learning paradigm that employs
finite-state automata for learning and utilizes propositional logic to
represent patterns. Due to its simplistic approach, TMs are inherently more
interpretable than learning algorithms based on Neural Networks. The
Convolutional TM has shown comparable performance on various datasets such as
MNIST, K-MNIST, F-MNIST and CIFAR-2. In this paper, we explore the
applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image
classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations
and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to
explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate
important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the
knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as
images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that
achieve 98.5\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to
88.07\% for ResNet50) respectively. We show that the TM performs competitively
to this deep learning model while maintaining its interpretability, even in
large-scale complex training environments. This contributes to a better
understanding of TM clauses and provides insights into how these models can be
applied to more complex and diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RoGRAD框架，首次系统比较了传统图神经网络增强方法和基于大语言模型的图增强方法在复合缺陷下的表现，并开发了一种基于检索增强生成的迭代式图对比学习框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图数据存在多种缺陷，严重影响GNN性能。现有研究缺乏对传统图增强方法和LLM增强方法在复合缺陷下表现的全面比较，也不清楚各自的优劣。

Method: 提出RoGRAD框架，采用检索增强生成(RAG)技术，通过提供类别一致且多样化的增强数据，结合迭代图对比学习来强制学习判别性表示，将LLM增强从静态信号注入转变为动态精炼。

Result: RoGRAD在广泛实验中表现出色，相比传统GNN和LLM增强基线方法，平均提升达到82.43%。

Conclusion: LLM增强并非总是优于传统方法，RoGRAD通过迭代式检索增强对比精炼框架，显著提升了图学习在复合缺陷下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely adopted in Web-related applications,
serving as a core technique for learning from graph-structured data, such as
text-attributed graphs. Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit
deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior
GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual
imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is
still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation
comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving
their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study
that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies,
revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM
augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we
propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement
(RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is
the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent,
diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through
iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs
from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments
demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced
baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA方法在性能上仍落后于全参数微调，部分原因是对低秩流形几何结构利用不足。

Method: 使用三因子分解U-S-V^⊤，约束U和V在Stiefel流形上保持正交性，采用几何优化设计将欧几里得优化器转换为黎曼优化器。

Result: 在常识推理、数学和代码生成、图像分类和图像生成等广泛下游任务中，该方法优于当前最先进的LoRA变体。

Conclusion: 提出的几何感知LoRA扩展方法能够有效提升性能，同时保持与现有微调管道的兼容性。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been widely adopted as a parameter-efficient
technique for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. However, it still
lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient
exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this
paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor
decomposition $U\!SV^\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value
decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$
and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie
on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training.
To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric
optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one.
It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing
fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream
tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image
classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of
our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗鲁棒性研究主要关注0-1损失，但实际应用中常使用交叉熵等损失函数。需要为任意损失函数提供统一的对抗鲁棒风险分析框架。

Method: 使用对偶理论和重心重构方法，推导出对抗鲁棒风险最小化问题的数学重构，特别针对交叉熵损失、幂形式损失和二次损失提供显式表征。

Result: 获得了对抗风险的下界计算方法，通过数值实验验证了交叉熵损失下更紧致的下界结果。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了对抗鲁棒性与优化理论的深刻联系，为超越0-1损失的鲁棒分类器设计提供了理论基础和计算工具。

Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under
arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the
corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide
explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,
loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way
available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient
computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the
design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers
interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing
problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures
where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our
theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments
where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the
cross-entropy loss function.

TL;DR: Moon是一个基于监督模态转换的多变量时间序列异常检测框架，通过将数值时间序列转换为图像表示，结合多模态CNN融合数值和图像数据，显著提升了异常检测的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MTS异常检测方法面临三个主要挑战：无监督方法依赖误差阈值导致不准确；半监督方法未充分利用异常标签；监督方法难以捕捉局部关系、计算成本高且受限于标注数据稀缺。

Method: 提出MV-MTF技术将数值时间序列转换为图像表示，使用多模态CNN融合数值和图像数据，通过参数共享提升训练效率，最后基于SHAP的异常解释器识别关键异常变量。

Result: 在6个真实世界MTS数据集上的实验表明，Moon在效率上比6种最先进方法提升高达93%，准确性提升4%，解释性能提升10.8%。

Conclusion: Moon框架通过模态转换和多模态融合，有效解决了现有MTS异常检测方法的局限性，在效率、准确性和可解释性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns
where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly
detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,
prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two
key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based
and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to
inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often
underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised
learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture
local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a
supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection
framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while
providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel
multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time
series data into image representations, capturing relationships across
variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that
cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a
Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion
model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a
SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to
anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world
MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by
up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation
performance.

Motivation: 在万维网应用中，可靠的时间序列预测对于资源规划、缓存放置和异常响应至关重要，需要比传统领域更快的响应速度来支持实时决策。

Method: 提出KAIROS非自回归时间序列预测框架，直接建模分段级多峰分布，避免自回归方法的误差累积问题，同时改进现有非自回归模型过度平滑的预测结果。

Result: 在大规模语料库上训练的KAIROS在六个广泛使用的基准测试中表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，预测性能与类似规模的先进基础模型相当，但推理成本显著降低。

Conclusion: KAIROS强调了非自回归设计作为时间序列基础模型可扩展范式的重要性，为Web应用提供了高效的实时预测解决方案。

Abstract: In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and
anomaly response, enabling platforms to operate efficiently as user behavior
and content distributions evolve. Compared with other domains, time series
forecasting for Web applications requires much faster responsiveness to support
real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak
distributions. Unlike autoregressive approaches, KAIROS avoids error
accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their
inference cost. Beyond empirical results, KAIROS highlights the importance of
non-autoregressive design as a scalable paradigm for foundation models in time
series.

Abstract: Calibrating machine learning models so that predicted probabilities better
reflect the true outcome frequencies is crucial for reliable decision-making
across many applications. In Federated Learning (FL), the goal is to train a
global model on data which is distributed across multiple clients and cannot be
centralized due to privacy concerns. FL is applied in key areas such as
healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated
private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the
integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically,
we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram
binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new
methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a
federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and
demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose
strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and
our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for
DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of
peptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models
provide continuous latent "maps" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore
decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering
exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based
remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in
practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware
framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a
Union of $\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\mathbb{M}^{\kappa}$, a family
of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring
computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order
Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent
second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation
Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete
amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian
Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.
Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which
interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,
biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro
validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel
seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active
peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial
strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides
a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.

Motivation: 现有的半监督图异常检测方法仅基于标注的正常节点学习正态性，容易过拟合给定模式，导致高误检率。需要利用未标注数据来校准正态性。

Method: GraphNC包含两个组件：1) 异常分数分布对齐(ScoreDA) - 将模型异常分数与教师模型的分数分布对齐；2) 基于扰动的正态性正则化(NormReg) - 在表示空间中对正常节点进行紧凑性正则化。

Result: 通过分数对齐使正常和异常类别的异常分数更可分离，同时通过表示空间正则化减少教师模型不准确分数的影响。

Conclusion: GraphNC框架能够有效校准图正态性，提高半监督图异常检测的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial
ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised
GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during
training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the
normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the
labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These
can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome
this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework
that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from
a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly
score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components,
anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality
regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by
aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to
accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in
the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of
the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more
separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the
teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed
to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the
representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a
perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.

Abstract: As AI systems become more embedded in everyday life, the development of fair
and unbiased models becomes more critical. Considering the social impact of AI
systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As
evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust
representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing
algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for
prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that
utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior
robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing
interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in
these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we
introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address
bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically
selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised
contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing
state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in mitigating bias with minimum
trade-off in accuracy and leveraging the learned fair representations in
various downstream tasks.

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning aims to recover reward models from expert

difficult to interpret and debug. In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating
Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an
evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward
function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is
executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate
GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns
highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we
demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to
both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth
rewards. Finally, we show that GRACE is able to build complex reward APIs in
multi-task setups.

Abstract: In deep learning, dense layer connectivity has become a key design principle
in deep neural networks (DNNs), enabling efficient information flow and strong
performance across a range of applications. In this work, we model densely
connected DNNs mathematically and analyze their learning problems in the
deep-layer limit. For a broad applicability, we present our analysis in a
framework setting of DNNs with densely connected layers and general non-local
feature transformations (with local feature transformations as special cases)
within layers, which is called dense non-local (DNL) framework and includes
standard DenseNets and variants as special examples. In this formulation, the
densely connected networks are modeled as nonlinear integral equations, in
contrast to the ordinary differential equation viewpoint commonly adopted in
prior works. We study the associated training problems from an optimal control
perspective and prove convergence results from the network learning problem to
its continuous-time counterpart. In particular, we show the convergence of
optimal values and the subsequence convergence of minimizers, using a piecewise
linear extension and $\Gamma$-convergence analysis. Our results provide a
mathematical foundation for understanding densely connected DNNs and further
suggest that such architectures can offer stability of training deep models.

Abstract: Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic to South
America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted
by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and
digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are
limited, but Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an
opportunity to prioritize patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The
George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic
approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main
results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged
several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing,
provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong
labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and
generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric
that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to
frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630
participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge,
representing diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide.

### [242] [Adaptive Heterogeneous Mixtures of Normalising Flows for Robust Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02056)
*Benjamin Wiriyapong,Oktay Karakuş,Kirill Sidorov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出AMF-VI方法，通过异构混合互补流模型（MAF、RealNVP、RBIG）的两阶段训练，实现跨不同后验分布的鲁棒变分推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一流模型在不同性质分布上的行为不一致，需要一种能适应多种后验分布的鲁棒变分推断方法。

Method: 两阶段训练：1）顺序专家训练单个流模型；2）通过似然驱动的自适应全局权重估计，无需逐样本门控或架构更改。

Result: 在六个典型后验分布上，AMF-VI始终获得比单一流基线更低的负对数似然，并在Wasserstein-2和MMD指标上表现稳定提升。

Conclusion: 自适应混合多样化流模型为跨不同后验家族的鲁棒变分推断提供了可靠途径，同时保留了每个专家的归纳偏差。

Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex
posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across
qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow
Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows
(MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of
individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via
likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes.
Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons,
rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower
negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable
gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD),
indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is
efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to
standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse
flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families
whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiFFPO是一个统一的强化学习框架，用于训练掩码扩散大语言模型，使其推理能力更强（furious）且更快。通过离策略RL训练代理策略，结合两阶段似然近似和重要性采样校正，提高样本效率和任务性能。同时联合训练高效采样器，让模型自适应分配推理阈值，在减少函数评估次数的同时获得更好准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如d1在训练扩散大语言模型时存在效率问题，需要开发既能提升推理质量又能加速推理速度的统一框架。

Method: 1. 使用离策略RL训练代理策略，采用两阶段似然近似和重要性采样校正；2. 联合训练高效采样器/控制器，让模型自适应分配每个提示的推理阈值。

Result: 在数学和规划基准任务上训练开源大扩散语言模型，相比仅训练模型，获得了更好的准确率和更低的函数评估次数，改善了推理时间计算的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: DiFFPO框架通过强化学习有效提升了扩散大语言模型的推理质量和速度，在减少计算成本的同时实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: We propose DiFFPO, Diffusion Fast and Furious Policy Optimization, a unified
framework for training masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) to reason
not only better (furious), but also faster via reinforcement learning (RL). We
first unify the existing baseline approach such as d1 by proposing to train
surrogate policies via off-policy RL, whose likelihood is much more tractable
as an approximation to the true dLLM policy. This naturally motivates a more
accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with
importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with
better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a
new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy.
Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by
letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each
prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower
number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only,
obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the
inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline
by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and
planning tasks.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在PPG分析中依赖生理意义不明确的特征，导致预测能力与临床可解释性及传感器设计之间的紧张关系。

Method: 提出PPGen生物物理模型和混合摊销推理(HAI)方法，结合生理模型和深度学习，在纠正模型错误设定的同时实现参数估计。

Result: 广泛的仿真实验表明，HAI能够在不同噪声和传感器条件下准确推断生理参数。

Conclusion: PPGen提供了一条路径，使PPG模型既能保持深度学习特征所需的保真度，又能支持临床解释和明智的硬件设计。

Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as
heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via
photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer
physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate.
However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning,
creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and
sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model
that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters.
Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast,
robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG
signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico
experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters
under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward
PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while
supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.

TL;DR: 本文针对Flow Matching算法在训练-推理差距和过度追求直线路径导致刚度问题，提出了基于最大似然估计的微调方法，包括直接微调和基于残差的微调，并通过实验验证了方法在图像生成和机器人操作任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow Matching算法虽然训练简单高效，但存在训练-推理差距，无法在训练阶段评估模型输出，且在机器人操作等高精度场景中问题尤为明显。同时，FM过度追求预定义的直线路径可能引入刚度等问题。

Method: 首先理论分析FM中训练损失与推理误差的关系，然后提出基于最大似然估计的微调方法，包括直接微调和基于残差的微调。后者通过特定架构设计可以融入收缩特性，增强模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Result: 在图像生成和机器人操作任务上的实验结果表明，该方法能够可靠地提升Flow Matching的推理性能。

Conclusion: 通过最大似然估计微调Flow Matching模型，可以有效解决训练-推理差距问题，提升模型在生成任务特别是机器人操作中的性能表现。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.

TL;DR: 提出了ExGRPO框架，通过识别推理经验的价值指标（正确性和熵），组织和优先处理有价值的经验，使用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用，显著提升大语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准在线策略训练在单次更新后丢弃经验，导致计算效率低和训练不稳定。虽然先前研究强调了重用经验的好处，但经验特征对大型推理模型学习动态的影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出ExGRPO框架，识别推理经验的价值指标（正确性和熵），组织和优先处理有价值的经验，使用混合策略目标平衡探索与经验利用。

Result: 在五个骨干模型（1.5B-8B参数）上，ExGRPO在数学/通用基准上持续提升推理性能，相比在线RLVR平均提升+3.5/7.6分。在强模型和弱模型上都能稳定训练，而在线方法在这些模型上会失败。

Conclusion: 原则性的经验管理是高效和可扩展RLVR的关键要素，ExGRPO通过有效利用经验显著提升了推理性能和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm
for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard
on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading
to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has
highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience
characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains
underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a
reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as
effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose
ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that
organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy
objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on
five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently
improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an
average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO
stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods
fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key
ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种直接从非结构化模型库（如Hugging Face）学习权重空间表示的方法，无需依赖精心构建的模型动物园，解决了权重空间学习领域对大规模计算资源的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重空间学习通常需要大量精心构建的模型动物园，这需要巨大的计算资源，限制了权重空间表示的规模和灵活性。本工作旨在摆脱这一限制，直接从大型非结构化模型库中学习权重表示。

Method: 提出了一种新的权重空间骨干网络，专门设计用于处理非结构化模型群体，能够处理来自Hugging Face等平台的高度异构模型（不同架构、数据集和文档不完整）。

Result: 在Hugging Face模型上训练的权重空间表示表现出色，通常优于在实验室生成的模型动物园上训练的骨干网络。模型权重的多样性使权重空间模型能够泛化到未见过的数据模态。

Conclusion: 研究表明高质量权重空间表示可以在非结构化环境中学习，精心构建的模型动物园并非不可或缺，这克服了权重空间学习社区当前面临的重要限制。

Abstract: The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving
rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is
that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large,
carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as
model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large
computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations
in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a
weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large,
unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model
zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in
architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the
methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight
space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We
demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging
Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on
laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the
model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize
to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space
representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are
not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by
the weight space learning community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdaBoost在实践中随着弱学习器数量增加而泛化良好，但其指数损失难以通过一阶方法优化。作者旨在开发一个理论上有基础且易于优化的多类指数损失替代方案。

Method: 引入PENEX损失函数，该函数隐式最大化数据点的边界，并通过梯度增量隐式参数化提升框架中的弱学习器。

Result: 在计算机视觉和语言任务中，PENEX表现出比类似计算成本的现有方法更好的正则化效果。

Conclusion: PENEX有潜力作为AdaBoost启发的替代方案，用于深度神经网络的有效训练和微调。

Abstract: AdaBoost sequentially fits so-called weak learners to minimize an exponential
loss, which penalizes mislabeled data points more severely than other loss
functions like cross-entropy. Paradoxically, AdaBoost generalizes well in
practice as the number of weak learners grows. In the present work, we
introduce Penalized Exponential Loss (PENEX), a new formulation of the
multi-class exponential loss that is theoretically grounded and, in contrast to
the existing formulation, amenable to optimization via first-order methods. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes
margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX
implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across
computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing
effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.
Our results highlight PENEX's potential as an AdaBoost-inspired alternative for
effective training and fine-tuning of deep neural networks.

Abstract: Today, natural gas, as a clean fuel and the best alternative to crude oil,
covers a significant part of global demand. Iran is one of the largest
countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest
country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy
consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in
cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,
especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This
study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in
Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and
a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and
meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were
trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption
patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model
outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean
Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust
performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest
that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be
effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to
more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study
highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in
predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across
different regions.

Method: 使用强化学习（RL）方法，Q-learning处理离散干扰事件状态，深度Q网络（DQN）处理基于接收功率的连续状态，通过不同奖励函数和动作集进行学习。

Result: 强化学习能够快速适应频谱动态变化，在信道和干扰策略随时间变化时仍能维持高传输速率。

Conclusion: 强化学习是应对动态反应式干扰的有效方法，能够在不了解环境先验知识的情况下实现自适应抗干扰通信。

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of mitigating reactive jamming, where a jammer
adopts a dynamic policy of selecting channels and sensing thresholds to detect
and jam ongoing transmissions. The transmitter-receiver pair learns to avoid
jamming and optimize throughput over time (without prior knowledge of channel
conditions or jamming strategies) by using reinforcement learning (RL) to adapt
transmit power, modulation, and channel selection. Q-learning is employed for
discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for
continuous states based on received power. Through different reward functions
and action sets, the results show that RL can adapt rapidly to spectrum
dynamics and sustain high rates as channels and jamming policies change over
time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模空间融合和实体匹配任务中，精确的召回控制至关重要，因为遗漏少量真实匹配会破坏下游分析，而过度的手动审查会增加成本。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了精确的召回控制，显著降低了阈值方差，提高了大规模空间融合任务的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and
entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break
downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical
confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds
on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points
and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We
present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent
variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly.
Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse
row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of
magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural
ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward
pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration
set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys,
Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting,
then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold
variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral
datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits
a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications
relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.

Conclusion: DECOR为存在潜在混淆的线性高斯SEM提供了一种有效的联合学习方法，理论保证在bow-free图和均匀特征值边界条件下具有全局参数可识别性。

Abstract: We study structure learning for linear Gaussian SEMs in the presence of
latent confounding. Existing continuous methods excel when errors are
independent, while deconfounding-first pipelines rely on pervasive factor
structure or nonlinearity. We propose \textsc{DECOR}, a single likelihood-based
and fully differentiable estimator that jointly learns a DAG and a correlated
noise model. Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter
identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a
uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\B,\OmegaMat)$ to the
observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the
noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph
update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity
penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step. On synthetic benchmarks that vary
confounding density, graph density, latent rank, and dimension with $n<p$,
\textsc{DECOR} matches or outperforms strong baselines and is especially robust
when confounding is non-pervasive, while remaining competitive under
pervasiveness.

Abstract: Hallucinations are a common issue that undermine the reliability of large
language models (LLMs). Recent studies have identified a specific subset of
hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive
uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating
predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been
developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty
estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA)
datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate
correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and,
consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows
one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We
propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation
experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms
for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge
variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore
structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection
tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we
propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an
objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.

Abstract: Efficient and inexpensive energy storage is essential for accelerating the
adoption of renewable energy and ensuring a stable supply, despite fluctuations
in sources such as wind and solar. Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen
energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However,
the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process
remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative
model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and
adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts.
We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept
application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for
which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst.
In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution
reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open
the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework
offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient
catalysts.

*Jianing Qi,Hao Tang,Zhigang Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将扩散模型中的无分类器引导方法扩展到经典策略梯度方法，提出策略梯度引导(PGG)，通过插值条件分支和无条件分支实现无需重新训练的行为调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将扩散模型中成功的引导技术应用到强化学习策略梯度方法中，实现测试时可控的行为调节，无需重新训练模型。

Method: 在策略梯度中增加无条件分支，通过插值条件分支和无条件分支来引导策略更新，在优势估计下归一化项消失，得到简洁的引导策略梯度更新公式。

Result: 在离散和连续控制基准测试中，条件丢弃在简单离散任务和低样本情况下有效，但会破坏连续控制的稳定性；适度增大引导系数能持续提升稳定性、样本效率和可控性。

Conclusion: 引导技术可以成功地从扩散策略扩展到标准在线策略方法，为可控在线强化学习开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Policy Gradient Guidance (PGG), a simple extension of
classifier-free guidance from diffusion models to classical policy gradient
methods. PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and
interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time
control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a
theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes
under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update.
Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We
find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in
simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes
continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\gamma>1$)
consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our
results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be
adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable
online reinforcement learning.

*Alexander Ryabchenko,Wenlong Mou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了动作触发稀疏可追踪马尔可夫决策过程（ATST-MDPs）框架，针对状态观测由动作随机触发的强化学习问题，开发了ST-LSVI-UCB算法，在稀疏观测约束下实现了高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中状态观测由动作随机触发的强化学习问题，这类问题在许多实际场景中普遍存在但缺乏系统性的理论框架。

Method: 推导了针对ATST-MDPs的Bellman最优方程，引入动作序列学习范式，在线性MDP假设下利用动作序列特征映射的线性表示，提出了具有统计误差保证的离策略估计器和ST-LSVI-UCB算法。

Result: ST-LSVI-UCB算法实现了$\widetilde O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$的遗憾界，其中K是回合数，d是特征维度，γ是折扣因子。

Conclusion: 为动作触发稀疏观测下的学习建立了理论基础，证明了在此类观测约束下高效学习仍然是可行的。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are
stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world
applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically
Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a
specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored
Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the
action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a
sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP
assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an
induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose
off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps
and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered
settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde
O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the
feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode
non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical
foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while
demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation
constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出DialTree-RPO框架，通过强化学习和树搜索自动发现多轮对话攻击策略，相比现有方法在多轮攻击成功率上提升25.9%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在多轮交互设置下仍易受对抗攻击，现有方法主要依赖人工红队测试或预定义模板，未能充分探索多轮攻击的复杂对话动态和策略规划空间。

Method: 将对话建模为序列决策问题，结合强化学习和树搜索，无需人工标注数据，系统性地探索多轮攻击策略。

Result: 在10个目标模型上，攻击成功率比现有最优方法提高25.9%以上，并成功发现新的攻击策略。

Conclusion: DialTree-RPO能有效发现多样化的多轮攻击策略，证明多轮对话攻击比单轮攻击更具威胁性，为AI安全研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models
remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings,
where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and
pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover
safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or
employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack
data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not
explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider
novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and
strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent
findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn
attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy
reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously
discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a
sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without
manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only
achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack
strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success
across multiple turns.

*Stefano Bruno,Youngsik Hwang,Jaehyeon An,Sotirios Sabanis,Dong-Young Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Flatness-Aware SGLD (fSGLD)算法，通过随机权重扰动隐式捕获曲率信息，在保持SGD计算成本的同时有效寻找平坦最小值，提升深度学习泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SGLD缺乏偏向平坦最小值的机制，而平坦最小值与深度学习泛化能力密切相关。需要开发既能高效寻找平坦最小值又保持计算效率的优化算法。

Method: fSGLD在每次迭代中使用随机权重扰动（RWP）计算随机梯度，优化随机平滑目标函数，隐式捕获曲率信息。通过适当耦合逆温度和随机扰动尺度，确保不变测度集中在Hessian迹正则化的全局最小化器附近。

Result: 理论证明fSGLD在Wasserstein距离下具有最佳收敛速率，实验在噪声标签和大规模视觉任务中显示fSGLD获得优越或相当的泛化性和鲁棒性，计算成本仅为SGD水平，约为SAM的一半。Hessian谱分析确认fSGLD收敛到显著更平坦的最小值。

Conclusion: fSGLD是首个既能高效寻找平坦最小值又保持计算效率的SGLD变体，为随机权重扰动的益处提供了严格理论解释，在训练和微调场景中均表现出色。

Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima
in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature
solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin
Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses
the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian
noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby
optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature
information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure
of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global
minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the
inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly
coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the
benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best
known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized
objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks,
in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD
achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline
algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of
SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to
significantly flatter minima.

TL;DR: 提出了Interactive Training框架，允许在神经网络训练过程中进行实时人工或AI干预，动态调整超参数、训练数据和模型检查点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络训练采用固定的优化方案，缺乏动态响应训练不稳定或问题的灵活性。

Method: 使用控制服务器在用户/代理与训练过程之间进行通信中介，支持动态调整优化器超参数、训练数据和模型检查点。

Result: 通过三个案例研究证明，该方法实现了更好的训练稳定性、降低了对初始超参数的敏感性，并提高了对用户需求变化的适应性。

Conclusion: 为AI代理自主监控训练日志、主动解决不稳定性和优化训练动态的未来训练范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined
optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to
instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce
Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time,
feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or
automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to
mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process,
allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data,
and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that
Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity
to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs,
paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously
monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training
dynamics.

### [260] [Poolformer: Recurrent Networks with Pooling for Long-Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02206)
*Daniel Gallo Fernández*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Poolformer是一种序列到序列模型，用循环层和池化操作替代自注意力机制，解决了长序列处理中的计算效率问题，在音频处理任务中表现优于现有最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在长序列处理中计算复杂度呈二次增长，限制了其实际应用。需要开发更高效的序列建模方法。

Method: 使用循环层替代自注意力，引入池化操作减少序列长度。模型采用递归定义的SkipBlocks结构，包含残差块、下采样池化层、嵌套SkipBlock、上采样池化层等组件。

Result: 池化操作显著加速训练，改善感知指标（FID和IS），防止过拟合。在原始音频处理任务中优于SaShiMi和Mamba等最先进模型。深层处理长程依赖，浅层处理短期特征。

Conclusion: Poolformer为长序列处理提供了高效解决方案，未来可扩展到文本、视觉和多模态应用，基于Poolformer的大语言模型有望有效处理图像和视频的密集表示。

Abstract: Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process
dense representations of images and videos.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究扩散模型成功的原因，基于流形假设，认为其适应数据低维几何结构的能力是关键。通过分析分数匹配学习问题，发现平滑分数函数会产生沿数据流形的平滑效果，且可通过选择适当平滑来控制扩散模型泛化的流形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在多个领域表现出卓越的泛化能力，但其机制尚未完全理解。基于流形假设，研究者希望验证扩散模型成功是否源于其适应数据低维几何结构的能力。

Method: 通过分析分数匹配学习问题的公式化，研究隐式正则化的作用，特别是平滑经验分数匹配目标最小化器的效果。结合理论和实证方法，检验平滑分数函数（或等价地在对数密度域平滑）如何产生沿数据流形的平滑效果。

Result: 理论和实证结果证实，平滑分数函数会产生沿数据流形的切向平滑。此外，研究显示可以通过选择适当的平滑来控制扩散模型泛化所沿的流形。

Conclusion: 该工作为扩散模型成功源于适应数据低维几何结构的猜想提供了证据，揭示了平滑分数函数在产生沿数据流形平滑中的关键作用，并展示了如何通过平滑选择来控制模型泛化行为。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating
remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the
mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially
understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes
this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure
within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on
how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem
through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by
investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score
matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that
smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density
domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we
show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be
controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.

TL;DR: StockBench是一个无污染基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在真实多个月股票交易环境中的表现，通过金融指标衡量其交易策略的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融基准主要测试静态知识问答，无法捕捉交易的动态和迭代特性，金融领域作为高价值高风险决策领域尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 构建包含价格、基本面数据和新闻的每日市场信号环境，让LLM代理做出连续的买入、卖出或持有决策，使用累积回报、最大回撤和索提诺比率等金融指标评估性能。

Result: 大多数LLM代理难以超越简单的买入持有基准，但部分模型显示出获得更高回报和更有效管理风险的潜力。

Conclusion: 在静态金融知识任务表现出色并不一定能转化为成功的交易策略，这突显了开发LLM驱动的金融代理的挑战和机遇。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities
as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential
decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains
such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain
remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and
high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test
static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing
the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce
StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in
realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market
signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential
buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics
such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and
open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM
agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models
demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more
effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in
developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static
financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful
trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support
reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界推荐数据由具有不同条件分布的异构用户群体组成，但单一全局目标的训练假设数据同质性。随着模型规模和复杂度增加，模型会偏向中心分布模式，忽视头尾区域，导致注意力权重不活跃或神经元死亡。

Method: 利用注意力机制在因子分解机中进行共享嵌入选择，通过分析数据集子结构，暴露具有强分布对比的子结构，使用部分冲突的辅助标签来正则化共享表示，定制注意力层学习过程以保持与少数群体的互信息。

Result: 在包含数十亿数据点的生产数据集上对6个SOTA模型进行评估，因子分解机能够使用所提方法捕获细粒度用户-广告交互，整体归一化熵降低0.16%，在目标少数群体上增益超过0.30%。

Conclusion: C2AL方法通过辅助学习有效解决了推荐系统中数据异构性问题，在保持全局性能的同时改善了少数群体的学习效果，证明了注意力机制在共享嵌入选择中的关键作用。

Abstract: Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective
implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world
data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional
distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is
used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns,
neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning
ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this
paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in
factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address
this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those
with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous
research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to
mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to
regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning
process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority
cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive
production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models.
Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained
user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16%
reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on
targeted minority cohorts.

Result: 获得了基于变换器的条件评分函数近似理论，构建了缺失值的紧致置信区域，发现缺失模式显著影响插值效率和准确性。

Conclusion: 为扩散模型的时间序列插值提供了理论保证，提出的混合掩码训练策略能有效提升性能，填补了该领域的理论空白。

Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型只能预测每个时间步的独立边际分布，无法生成具有真实相关结构的完整联合预测分布。自回归采样虽然能生成相关样本路径，但计算成本极高。

Method: 采用copula方法，通过一个前向传递从现有的多步时间序列基础模型生成相关样本路径，避免了昂贵的自回归采样过程。

Result: 该方法生成相关样本路径的速度比自回归采样快几个数量级，并通过减轻误差累积现象提高了样本路径质量。

Conclusion: copula方法为时间序列预测提供了一种高效生成相关样本路径的可行方案，显著提升了多步预测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer一直是主导架构，但xLSTM等替代方案在保持竞争力的同时具有线性复杂度。研究旨在比较两种架构的扩展行为，为未来模型设计和部署提供指导。

Method: 采用IsoFLOP和参数拟合方法，在广泛模型规模（80M-7B）和训练token数量（2B-2T）下研究xLSTM的扩展行为；考察最优模型大小对上下文长度的依赖性；分析推理时的扩展特性。

Result: xLSTM在计算最优和过训练机制下都表现出良好的扩展性；最优模型大小与上下文长度密切相关；在典型LLM训练和推理场景中，xLSTM比Transformer扩展更有利。

Conclusion: xLSTM在扩展性方面优于Transformer，特别是在长上下文场景中优势更加显著，这为未来大语言模型架构选择提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Scaling laws play a central role in the success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), enabling the prediction of model performance relative to compute
budgets prior to training. While Transformers have been the dominant
architecture, recent alternatives such as xLSTM offer linear complexity with
respect to context length while remaining competitive in the billion-parameter
regime. We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of
Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide
future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for
xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and
parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of
training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model
sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous
work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics. Our findings
reveal that in typical LLM training and inference scenarios, xLSTM scales
favorably compared to Transformers. Importantly, xLSTM's advantage widens as
training and inference contexts grow.

Method: 采用正未标记学习，结合LSTM自编码器和K-Means聚类，利用3GPP关键性能指标和性能测量计数器作为特征来检测攻击。

Result: 在基于free5GC和UERANSIM的5G测试床上评估，当训练数据包含10%到40%攻击污染时，F1分数超过98.50%，优于其他对比方案。

Conclusion: PUL-Inter-Slice Defender能有效检测分布式切片移动性攻击变体，在存在污染训练数据时保持鲁棒性，为5G网络切片安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its
counterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining
One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.

Motivation: 传统深度学习优化器每步更新所有层，但作者发现这种全网络更新在理论和实践上都是次优的，需要更高效的训练方法。

Method: 提出Drop-Muon框架，每步只随机更新部分层，结合渐进式训练和层特定的非欧几里得更新。

Result: 在CNN实验中，Drop-Muon始终优于全网络Muon，达到相同精度时速度提升1.4倍，并提供了收敛性理论保证。

Conclusion: 全网络更新并非最优策略，Drop-Muon为大规模模型训练提供了更高效的理论基础替代方案。

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all
layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art
optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing
that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and
in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training
method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of
layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of
progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier
performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise
smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and
stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive
training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further
reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific
relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms
full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in
wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale
models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a
highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.

*Tobias Kreiman,Yutong Bai,Fadi Atieh,Elizabeth Weaver,Eric Qu,Aditi S. Krishnapriyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究表明，未经修改的标准Transformer模型仅基于笛卡尔坐标就能在分子能量和力预测任务上达到与最先进等变图神经网络相当的性能，无需预定义图结构或物理先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图神经网络(GNNs)在分子机器学习中依赖预定义的图结构，这限制了模型的表达能力并降低了推理速度。研究旨在探索纯Transformer是否能在没有图结构或物理先验的情况下学习分子能量和力。

Method: 使用标准Transformer模型，直接输入笛卡尔坐标进行训练，不引入预定义的图结构或物理先验，与等变GNN在相同计算预算下进行对比。

Result: Transformer在OMol25数据集上达到了与最先进等变GNN相当的能均绝对误差和力均绝对误差，并自适应地学习了物理一致的模式，如注意力权重与原子间距离成反比衰减。

Conclusion: Transformer能够自适应地学习GNN的有利特性，挑战了硬编码图归纳偏置的必要性，为分子建模提供了标准化、可扩展的架构方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the dominant architecture for molecular
machine learning, particularly for molecular property prediction and machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). GNNs perform message passing on
predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor
scheme. While this design aligns with the locality present in many molecular
tasks, a hard-coded graph can limit expressivity due to the fixed receptive
field and slows down inference with sparse graph operations. In this work, we
investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian
coordinates$\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical
priors$\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a
starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to
competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training
compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25
dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent
patterns$\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with
interatomic distance$\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different
molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a
standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to
scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in
other domains. Our results demonstrate that many favorable properties of GNNs
can emerge adaptively in Transformers, challenging the necessity of hard-coded
graph inductive biases and pointing toward standardized, scalable architectures
for molecular modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion^2是一种基于扩散模型的方法，使用3D点云来建模从Wi-Fi到毫米波的广泛频率范围的RF信号传播，比现有方法快27倍且误差仅为1.9dB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RF信号传播建模对于环境理解和无线诊断、部署优化至关重要，但复杂环境中的准确预测仍具挑战性，因为信号会与障碍物发生吸收和反射等相互作用。

Method: 提出Diffusion^2方法，使用RF-3D编码器从3D数据中捕获RF相关特征，并通过多尺度嵌入模拟实际的RF信号传播过程。

Result: 在合成和真实世界测量中的评估表明，Diffusion^2在各种频率带和环境条件下准确估计RF信号行为，误差仅为1.9dB，比现有方法快27倍。

Conclusion: Diffusion^2在RF信号传播建模领域取得了显著进展，为复杂环境中的无线信号预测提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling radio frequency (RF) signal propagation is essential for
understanding the environment, as RF signals offer valuable insights beyond the
capabilities of RGB cameras, which are limited by the visible-light spectrum,
lens coverage, and occlusions. It is also useful for supporting wireless
diagnosis, deployment, and optimization. However, accurately predicting RF
signals in complex environments remains a challenge due to interactions with
obstacles such as absorption and reflection. We introduce Diffusion^2, a
diffusion-based approach that uses 3D point clouds to model the propagation of
RF signals across a wide range of frequencies, from Wi-Fi to millimeter waves.
To effectively capture RF-related features from 3D data, we present the RF-3D
Encoder, which encapsulates the complexities of 3D geometry along with
signal-specific details. These features undergo multi-scale embedding to
simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on
synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately
estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and
environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster
than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field. Refer to

Abstract: Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant
practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from
the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks
(GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic
forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available
benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information
about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about
road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls
short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain
information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city
road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much
denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide
a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting
by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with
the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold
increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road
features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic
speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show
that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic
forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this
issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that
uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus
achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger
forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve
as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型溯源和未经授权的蒸馏复制问题，关注模型来源验证。

Method: 模型无关框架，结合无数据输入合成和统计分数计算，适用于分类和生成模型。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上检测准确率提升59.6%，ImageNet上提升71.2%，文生图任务提升20.0%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效检测知识蒸馏，在多种架构和任务上优于基线方法。

Abstract: We propose the task of knowledge distillation detection, which aims to
determine whether a student model has been distilled from a given teacher,
under a practical setting where only the student's weights and the teacher's
API are available. This problem is motivated by growing concerns about model
provenance and unauthorized replication through distillation. To address this
task, we introduce a model-agnostic framework that combines data-free input
synthesis and statistical score computation for detecting distillation. Our
approach is applicable to both classification and generative models.
Experiments on diverse architectures for image classification and text-to-image
generation show that our method improves detection accuracy over the strongest
baselines by 59.6% on CIFAR-10, 71.2% on ImageNet, and 20.0% for text-to-image
generation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LEGO方法，利用图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度正交化来估计数据流形的切空间，相比传统LPCA方法在噪声环境下更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LPCA方法在高噪声环境下存在邻域大小选择的临界权衡问题，需要先验的几何和噪声知识，而这些信息通常不可得。

Method: LEGO方法通过正交化图拉普拉斯低频特征向量的梯度来估计每个数据点的切空间，利用数据的全局结构指导局部切空间估计。

Result: 实验表明LEGO比LPCA对噪声更鲁棒，在流形学习、边界检测和局部内在维度估计等下游任务中表现显著提升。

Conclusion: LEGO提供了一种基于谱方法的鲁棒切空间估计技术，通过利用全局结构信息克服了传统局部方法的局限性。

Abstract: Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in
data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis
(LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in
choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior
knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often
unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector
Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the
data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on
local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by
orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph
Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a
differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows
that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align
closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high
gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum.
Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency
eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are
significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked
improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection,
and local intrinsic dimension estimation.

TL;DR: KaVa框架通过从教师模型的压缩KV缓存中蒸馏知识到潜在推理学生模型，解决了显式思维链推理的计算开销和潜在推理缺乏监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显式思维链推理虽然效果好但计算成本高，而潜在推理虽然高效但缺乏有效监督，在复杂自然语言推理上效果有限。

Method: 通过自蒸馏方法，利用压缩KV缓存作为监督信号，将教师模型的KV轨迹与潜在推理学生模型对齐，使用连续潜在令牌实现表示对齐。

Result: KaVa在潜在推理基准上表现优于强基线，从方程推理到自然语言推理的性能下降显著减小，并能扩展到更大骨干网络同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 压缩KV缓存蒸馏为潜在推理提供了可扩展的监督信号，结合了思维链训练的准确性和潜在推理的效率与可部署性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at multi-step reasoning problems with
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT), but verbose traces incur significant
computational costs and memory overhead, and often carry redundant, stylistic
artifacts. Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that
internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of
supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning
traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this
gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher
into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the
representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV
trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within
compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a
rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the
approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly
smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales
to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish
compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent
reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency
and deployability of latent inference.

*Chetwin Low,Weimin Wang,Calder Katyal*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Ovi是一个统一的音频-视频生成范式，通过双DiT模块的块级跨模态融合，将两种模态建模为单一生成过程，实现自然同步，无需单独流程或后处理对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频-视频生成方法通常依赖复杂的多阶段架构或声音和视觉的顺序合成，需要独立的流程和后处理对齐。

Method: 使用块级跨模态融合的双DiT模块，初始化音频塔与预训练视频模型相同的架构，通过缩放RoPE嵌入和双向交叉注意力联合训练视频和音频塔。

Result: 模型能够生成具有自然语音和准确、上下文匹配音效的电影级视频片段，音频塔能够生成逼真的音效以及传达丰富说话人身份和情感的语音。

Conclusion: Ovi提供了一个统一的音频-视频生成框架，实现了自然同步的跨模态生成，支持具有自然语音和准确音效的电影级视频创作。

Abstract: Audio-video generation has often relied on complex multi-stage architectures
or sequential synthesis of sound and visuals. We introduce Ovi, a unified
paradigm for audio-video generation that models the two modalities as a single
generative process. By using blockwise cross-modal fusion of twin-DiT modules,
Ovi achieves natural synchronization and removes the need for separate
pipelines or post hoc alignment. To facilitate fine-grained multimodal fusion
modeling, we initialize an audio tower with an architecture identical to that
of a strong pretrained video model. Trained from scratch on hundreds of
thousands of hours of raw audio, the audio tower learns to generate realistic
sound effects, as well as speech that conveys rich speaker identity and
emotion. Fusion is obtained by jointly training the identical video and audio
towers via blockwise exchange of timing (via scaled-RoPE embeddings) and
semantics (through bidirectional cross-attention) on a vast video corpus. Our
model enables cinematic storytelling with natural speech and accurate,
context-matched sound effects, producing movie-grade video clips. All the
demos, code and model weights are published at https://aaxwaz.github.io/Ovi

TL;DR: 对比损失和三元组损失在深度度量学习中的效果对比研究，发现三元组损失在保持类内和类间方差方面表现更好，支持更细粒度的表示学习，在分类和检索任务中性能更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比损失和三元组损失被广泛用于深度度量学习，但它们在表示质量上的影响尚未得到充分理解，需要进行理论和实证比较。

Method: 通过理论分析和在合成数据、MNIST、CIFAR-10等真实数据集上的任务特定实验，比较两种损失的类内/类间方差和优化行为（如贪婪更新）。

Result: 三元组损失在类内和类间保留了更大的方差，支持更细粒度的区分；在优化动态方面，对比损失早期产生许多小更新，而三元组损失产生较少但更强的更新，持续学习困难样本。

Conclusion: 三元组损失在分类和检索任务中表现更优，建议使用三元组损失来保留细节和关注困难样本，使用对比损失进行平滑的、基于广泛的嵌入优化。

Abstract: Contrastive loss and triplet loss are widely used objectives in deep metric
learning, yet their effects on representation quality remain insufficiently
understood. We present a theoretical and empirical comparison of these losses,
focusing on intra- and inter-class variance and optimization behavior (e.g.,
greedy updates). Through task-specific experiments with consistent settings on
synthetic data and real datasets-MNIST, CIFAR-10-it is shown that triplet loss
preserves greater variance within and across classes, supporting finer-grained
distinctions in the learned representations. In contrast, contrastive loss
tends to compact intra-class embeddings, which may obscure subtle semantic
differences. To better understand their optimization dynamics, By examining
loss-decay rate, active ratio, and gradient norm, we find that contrastive loss
drives many small updates early on, while triplet loss produces fewer but
stronger updates that sustain learning on hard examples. Finally, across both
classification and retrieval tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and CARS196
datasets, our results consistently show that triplet loss yields superior
performance, which suggests using triplet loss for detail retention and
hard-sample focus, and contrastive loss for smoother, broad-based embedding
refinement.
