Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种系统性的评估方法来分析和量化唇部泄漏问题，包括三个互补的测试设置和衍生指标，为说话人脸生成建立了更可靠的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于修复的说话人脸生成方法在修改唇部运动时可能引入唇部泄漏问题，即生成的唇部受到参考图像的影响而非仅由驱动音频决定，这种泄漏难以通过标准指标和常规测试设置检测。

Method: 采用三种互补的测试设置：静默输入生成、不匹配的音频-视频配对和匹配的音频-视频合成，并引入唇部同步差异和基于静默音频的唇部同步得分等衍生指标，同时研究了不同身份参考选择对泄漏的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的系统性评估方法能够有效分析和量化唇部泄漏问题，为未来说话人脸生成研究建立了更可靠的基准，同时为参考图像设计提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

### [3] [A Multi-Drone Multi-View Dataset and Deep Learning Framework for Pedestrian Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08615)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MATRIX数据集和深度学习框架，用于解决多无人机动态监控中的行人跟踪问题，在复杂遮挡环境下保持约90%的检测跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理动态相机位置和复杂遮挡，需要开发能够适应多无人机动态监控场景的鲁棒跟踪系统。

Method: 使用实时相机标定、基于特征的图像配准，以及在鸟瞰图表示中的多视角特征融合技术。

Result: 在复杂环境中保持约90%的检测跟踪精度，成功跟踪约80%的轨迹，并展现出良好的泛化能力和相机故障下的优雅性能退化。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视角监控系统提供了重要基准，证明了在复杂环境下鲁棒行人跟踪的可行性。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

*Xuan Yu,Tianyang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于Grassmannian流形的拓扑驱动多子空间融合框架，通过自适应子空间协作和Fréchet均值优化来增强几何表示学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态单子空间表示，忽略了多子空间之间的动态交互对捕捉复杂几何结构的重要性。

Method: 1) 基于Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的自适应多子空间建模机制；2) 通过Fréchet均值优化在流形上融合异构几何表示的多子空间交互块；3) 引入Riemannian批量归一化和互信息正则化。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了几何深度学习，还将欧几里得网络中经过验证的多通道交互理念成功适应到非欧几里得领域，实现了优越的判别性和可解释性。

Abstract: Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.

### [5] [Time-to-Move: Training-Free Motion Controlled Video Generation via Dual-Clock Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08633)
*Assaf Singer,Noam Rotstein,Amir Mann,Ron Kimmel,Or Litany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTM是一个无需训练、即插即用的视频生成框架，通过粗参考动画实现精确的运动控制，同时保持外观一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像和文本的视频生成方法无法提供精确的运动控制，而需要微调的方法计算成本高且受限。

Method: 使用用户友好的操作（如剪切拖拽或深度重投影）获取粗参考动画作为运动线索，采用双时钟去噪策略在指定运动区域强制对齐，同时允许其他区域灵活生成。

Result: 在物体和相机运动基准测试中，TTM在真实感和运动控制方面匹配或超越了现有基于训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: TTM提供了一种轻量级的采样过程修改，无需额外训练成本，实现了精确的运动和外观控制，超越了仅文本提示的限制。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

### [6] [CADIC: Continual Anomaly Detection Based on Incremental Coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08634)
*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的持续异常检测框架，所有任务共享统一内存库，通过固定大小的核心集增量更新嵌入，在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于嵌入的持续异常检测方法需要为每个任务构建特定类别子内存库的问题，这限制了方法的灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用统一内存库，在训练阶段通过固定大小的核心集增量更新嵌入，推理阶段通过最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Result: 在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上分别达到0.972和0.891的平均图像级AUROC分数，在真实电子纸数据集上实现100%异常样本检测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高检测精度的同时，提高了持续异常检测的灵活性和可扩展性，在实际场景中表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架，结合扩散去噪和时间感知的actor-critic模型，用于自动驾驶中的事故预测，在传感器退化和噪声条件下实现早期可靠预警。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶事故预测中的两个关键挑战：噪声或退化的传感器输入，以及需要平衡及时预警与误报抑制的可靠预测需求。

Method: 使用扩散模块通过迭代精炼重建噪声鲁棒的图像和物体特征，同时采用时间感知的actor-critic架构进行长期时序推理和时间加权奖励优化，确定最佳预警时机。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（DAD、CCD、A3D）上达到最先进准确率，显著提升平均事故前时间，在高斯和脉冲噪声下保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该模型在常规和复杂交通场景中产生更早、更稳定且与人类判断一致的预测，展现了在现实世界安全关键部署中的潜力。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

### [8] [RS-Net: Context-Aware Relation Scoring for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08651)
*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RS-Net是一个模块化框架，通过空间交互和长程时序上下文对物体对的关系重要性进行评分，可轻松集成到现有动态场景图生成模型中，显著提升关系预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景图生成方法仅在有标注的物体对上训练，缺乏对非相关对的指导，导致在推理时难以识别有意义的关系。

Method: 提出关系评分网络(RS-Net)，包含具有可学习上下文token的空间上下文编码器和聚合视频级信息的时序编码器，将关系评分集成到统一的三元组评分机制中。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上的实验显示，RS-Net在不同基线上一致提升Recall和Precision，在mean Recall上获得显著增益，表明其能有效处理关系的长尾分布问题。

Conclusion: RS-Net在保持竞争性效率的同时，实现了优于最先进方法的性能，可轻松集成到现有DSGG模型而不需要架构更改。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

### [9] [Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666)
*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中保护视频基础模型视觉隐私的新方法，通过轻量级匿名化适配器模块在保持任务效用的同时移除隐私信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型提取的时空特征在分享或存储时会无意中泄露敏感个人信息（如肤色、性别、服装），而现有的像素级匿名化方法需要重新训练整个模型且不适用于视频基础模型。

Method: 设计了轻量级匿名化适配器模块（AAM），采用三种新的训练目标：剪辑级自监督隐私目标、协同训练目标和潜在一致性损失，可在冻结的视频编码器上即插即用。

Result: 在多个下游任务评估中，隐私泄露显著减少35%，同时保持接近基线的效用性能，并有效缓解了动作识别模型中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频基础模型提供了一种高效、通用的隐私保护解决方案，能够在保护隐私的同时维持模型性能并促进更公平的视频理解。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了自回归逐像素预测的扩展特性，发现在固定32x32分辨率下，图像分类和图像生成的最优扩展策略存在差异，生成任务需要数据量比分类任务快3-5倍增长。随着分辨率提高，模型规模需比数据量增长更快，主要瓶颈是计算而非训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归逐像素预测这一简单但未被充分研究的统一视觉模型框架的扩展特性，了解不同视觉任务的最优扩展策略差异。

Method: 使用IsoFlops配置文件在高达7e19 FLOPs的计算预算下训练一系列Transformer模型，评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和Fréchet距离衡量的生成质量。

Result: 1. 在固定32x32分辨率下，图像分类和图像生成的最优扩展策略不同，生成任务需要数据量比分类任务快3-5倍增长；2. 随着分辨率提高，模型规模需比数据量增长更快；3. 主要瓶颈是计算而非训练数据量。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果预测，随着计算能力每年增长4-5倍，未来五年内实现逐像素图像建模是可行的。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

*Abhipsa Basu,Aviral Gupta,Abhijnya Bhat,R. Venkatesh Babu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究使用扩散模型微调技术（LoRA和DreamBooth）生成更准确的平衡训练数据，以解决图像分类中的群体偏见问题。通过聚类和每个聚类训练DreamBooth模型的方法，有效防止模型被组内变异淹没。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类系统常因训练数据中群体代表性不均而继承偏见，如人脸数据集中金发与女性的过度关联。现有方法使用Stable Diffusion生成平衡数据但难以保持原始数据分布。

Method: 探索多种扩散模型微调技术（LoRA、DreamBooth），对每个训练组直接学习样本生成更准确图像。为防止DreamBooth模型被组内变异淹没，采用组内图像聚类并为每个聚类训练单独模型。使用这些模型生成平衡数据进行预训练，然后在真实数据上微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，研究的微调方法平均优于原始Stable Diffusion，与最先进的去偏技术（如Group-DRO）结果相当，且随着数据集偏见严重程度增加而超越这些方法。

Conclusion: 扩散模型微调技术能有效生成平衡训练数据，缓解图像分类中的群体偏见问题，特别是在高偏见场景下表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

*Abu Taib Mohammed Shahjahan,A. Ben Hamza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseKAN是一个基于图Kolmogorov-Arnold网络的自适应图框架，用于从单张图像进行2D到3D姿态提升，通过可学习的边函数和多跳特征聚合解决GCN在长程依赖和高频细节建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GCN方法在3D人体姿态估计中表现良好，但其局部感受野限制了捕捉长程依赖关系的能力，且存在频谱偏差，难以处理遮挡和深度模糊问题，同时难以建模高频细节。

Method: 提出PoseKAN框架，将KAN扩展到图学习，使用可学习的边函数进行数据驱动的自适应特征变换，采用多跳特征聚合、残差PoseKAN块和全局响应归一化来增强空间感知和特征选择性。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该模型在性能上可与最先进方法竞争。

Conclusion: PoseKAN通过自适应图KAN框架有效解决了GCN在长程依赖和高频细节建模方面的限制，在3D人体姿态估计任务中展现出竞争力。

Abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based methods have shown strong performance in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging the natural graph structure of the human skeleton. However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SIFT-Graph框架通过结合结构感知的多模态特征，为传统视觉模型提供了有效的对抗防御能力。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks expose a fundamental vulnerability in modern deep vision models by exploiting their dependence on dense, pixel-level representations that are highly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations. Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的旋转不变3D点云学习方法，通过引入阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)和旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)，解决了现有方法因感受野受限导致的翼尖特征崩溃问题，在保持旋转不变性的同时保留全局姿态信息。

Conclusion: 通过结合局部旋转不变特征和全局姿态信息，该方法有效解决了旋转不变学习中的翼尖特征崩溃问题，实现了更好的空间区分能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

TL;DR: 提出SAS-SSM模型，通过结构感知的时空卷积和跨步扫描策略，在保持线性复杂度的同时有效建模3D人体姿态的局部和全局依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于状态空间模型的3D姿态估计方法通过手动设计的扫描操作将2D姿态序列展平为纯时间序列，破坏了人体姿态的固有空间结构，难以捕捉复杂的姿态依赖关系。

Method: 提出SAS-SSM：1）使用结构感知时空卷积动态捕捉关节间的局部交互；2）应用跨步扫描策略构建多尺度全局结构表示；3）在SAS-SSM基础上构建SasMamba模型。

Conclusion: SAS-SSM能够灵活建模局部和全局姿态信息，同时保持线性计算复杂度，为3D人体姿态估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture based on State Space Models (SSMs) has gained attention in 3D human pose estimation due to its linear complexity and strong global modeling capability. However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

Conclusion: 提出的MFAVBs通过显式特征融合和多重增强操作，有效提升了对比学习聚类的性能，证明了该方法在图像聚类任务中的有效性。

Abstract: In the field of image clustering, the widely used contrastive learning networks improve clustering performance by maximizing the similarity between positive pairs and the dissimilarity of negative pairs of the inputs. Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model. Our experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that MFAVBs serving as the backbone for contrastive clustering outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of clustering performance.

Conclusion: 该方法在训练数据上表现优异，但泛化到新数据存在挑战，这对临床应用至关重要。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

Abstract: Object recognition plays a fundamental role in how biological organisms perceive and interact with their environment. While the human visual system performs this task with remarkable efficiency, reproducing similar capabilities in artificial systems remains challenging. This study investigates VisNet, a biologically inspired neural network model, and several enhanced variants incorporating radial basis function neurons, Mahalanobis distance based learning, and retinal like preprocessing for both general object recognition and symmetry classification. By leveraging principles of Hebbian learning and temporal continuity associating temporally adjacent views to build invariant representations. VisNet and its extensions capture robust and transformation invariant features. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and custom symmetric object sets, show that these enhanced VisNet variants substantially improve recognition accuracy compared with the baseline model. These findings underscore the adaptability and biological relevance of VisNet inspired architectures, offering a powerful and interpretable framework for visual recognition in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: ACKD方法能够有效处理弱语义一致性下的跨模态知识传输问题，SemBridge框架通过动态样本选择和最优传输路径优化提升了知识蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Abstract: Unsupervised remote sensing change detection aims to monitor and analyze changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images in the same geometric region at different times, without the need for labeled training data. Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce the overfitting issues in the generator-based reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a Semantic Consistency (SC) module to enable detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

Conclusion: NES方法有效解决了零样本图像描述中的幻觉问题，通过负实体抑制机制显著提升了模型的跨域泛化性能。

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/antgroup/SPEED-Q.

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 建立了一种鲁棒的新范式，用于实现高保真度的单步扩散模型，在多样任务中达到最先进性能。

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

TL;DR: NAMEA是一种新颖的集成攻击方法，通过整合集成模型中非注意力区域的梯度来提高对抗样本在异构模型架构间的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集成攻击在异构模型架构间的迁移效果不佳，主要原因是异构代理模型的梯度更新方向差异很大，难以在充分利用个体模型的同时减少集成模型的梯度方差。

Method: 设计了NAMEA集成攻击，首次将集成模型中非注意力区域的梯度整合到迭代梯度优化过程中。通过解耦注意力区域和非注意力区域的梯度，并使用元学习进行梯度融合。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，NAMEA比当前最先进的集成攻击方法AdaEA和SMER分别平均高出15.0%和9.6%。

Conclusion: 这是首次探索集成非注意力在提升跨架构可迁移性方面的能力，为发起集成攻击提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经B帧视频压缩（NBVC）相比P帧压缩研究较少，其分层编码可能导致连续时间预测复杂化，特别是在帧跨度较大的层级，造成两个参考帧贡献不平衡。

Method: 提出BRHVC方法，包含双向运动收敛（BMC）和双向上下文融合（BCF）。BMC在运动压缩中收敛多个光流，实现更准确的大尺度运动补偿；BCF在运动补偿精度指导下显式建模参考上下文的权重。

Result: 实验结果表明BRHVC超越了之前最先进的神经视频压缩方法，甚至在HEVC数据集上超过了传统编码标准VTM-RA（随机访问配置）。

Conclusion: 通过更高效的运动和上下文处理，BRHVC能够有效协调双向参考帧，显著提升视频压缩性能。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分形生成模型(FGM)在生成高质量图像方面高效，但其固有的自相似性限制了输出图像的多样性。需要一种方法来增强生成结果的多样性而不牺牲视觉质量

Method: 1) 提出可学习的HD估计方法直接从图像嵌入预测HD；2) 采用基于HD的损失函数和单调动量驱动调度策略渐进优化超参数；3) 在推理阶段使用HD引导的拒绝采样选择几何更丰富的输出

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，FGM-HD框架相比原始FGM实现了39%的输出多样性提升，同时保持了相当的图像质量

Conclusion: 这是首个将Hausdorff维度引入FGM的工作，有效增强了生成输出的多样性，并为FGM发展提供了理论贡献

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

TL;DR: AuthSig是一个基于生成模型和水印的静态电子签名框架，通过将认证信息嵌入签名图像来解决静态签名易被恶意复制和重用的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无纸化工作流程的普及，静态扫描签名因其便利性仍然广泛使用，但这些签名几乎失去了认证属性，无法可靠验证且容易受到恶意复制和重用。

Method: 利用人类视觉系统对细微风格变化不敏感的特点，AuthSig在生成过程中精细调节风格嵌入来隐式编码水印位，实现"一次签名，一次使用"策略。同时引入关键点驱动的数据增强策略来增强风格多样性，支持鲁棒的水印嵌入。

Result: 实验结果显示，AuthSig在数字域失真和签名特定退化下实现了超过98%的提取准确率，在打印扫描场景中仍然有效。

Conclusion: AuthSig通过将认证信息绑定到签名图像，有效解决了静态电子签名的安全验证问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Result: 实验结果表明，相比现有策略，该方法显著提升了ICL性能

Conclusion: CoDR为高效有效的演示选择提供了稳健解决方案

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

Conclusion: WDT-MD框架显著提升了微动脉瘤检测性能，对改进早期糖尿病视网膜病变筛查具有重要前景。

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

Conclusion: 该模型能够有效处理噪声污染和强度不均匀性，在图像分割任务中表现出优越的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

Conclusion: 负向提示是推进开放集视觉识别系统的关键新维度，T-Rex-Omni支持灵活的正向或联合正负推理模式部署。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

Motivation: 现有基于语言解码器的缓解方法通常独立调节视觉或文本注意力，忽视了它们作为两个关键因果因素的相互作用。为了解决这个问题，需要建模幻觉过程的因果关系并处理视觉和文本注意力的交互影响。

Conclusion: Owl框架通过因果建模和注意力重加权有效缓解了大型视觉语言模型中的目标幻觉问题，证明了处理视觉和文本注意力交互的重要性，并为幻觉缓解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Abstract: Ground-based remote sensing cloud image sequence extrapolation is a key research area in the development of photovoltaic power systems. However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common "ghosting effect." It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures. As a key contribution, we also introduce and release the ASI-CIS dataset. Extensive experiments on ASI-CIS demonstrate that USF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a superior balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for ground-based cloud extrapolation.

Specifically, our method has the following advantages: 1) 4KDehazeFlow is a general method compatible with various deep learning networks, without relying on any specific network architecture. 2) We propose a learnable 3D lookup table (LUT) that encodes haze transformation parameters into a compact 3D mapping matrix, enabling efficient inference through precomputed mappings. 3) We utilize a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver to stably solve the dehazing flow field through an accurate step-by-step iterative method, effectively suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments show that 4KDehazeFlow exceeds seven state-of-the-art methods. It delivers a 2dB PSNR increase and better performance in dense haze and color fidelity.

TL;DR: PAN是一个通用的、可交互的、长视野的世界模型，通过高质量视频模拟预测未来世界状态，结合LLM的潜在动态推理和视频扩散解码器，实现推理与现实的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏因果控制、交互性和长视野一致性，而现有世界模型往往局限于特定领域且泛化能力有限，需要开发通用、可控的世界模型来支持推理和规划。

Method: 采用生成潜在预测(GLP)架构，结合基于LLM的自回归潜在动态主干和视频扩散解码器，在大规模视频-动作对数据上训练，支持开放领域、动作条件的模拟。

Result: 实验表明PAN在动作条件世界模拟、长视野预测和模拟推理方面表现优异，优于其他视频生成器和世界模型。

Conclusion: PAN朝着通用世界模型迈出了一步，能够对未来世界状态进行预测性模拟，支持推理和行动规划。

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

Motivation: 当前视觉问答系统在处理文化特定内容时存在局限，因为文化知识在训练语料中代表性不足，且推理过程对用户不透明。

Method: 集成文化对象检测主干网络与结构化程序生成层，构建包含文化实体知识库的双模态解释模块，结合视觉注意力和可读文本推理。

Result: 构建了越南文化VQA数据集，展示了基于编程方法在文化AI中的实用性，系统提供透明解释揭示计算原理和文化背景。

Conclusion: 该框架支持教育和文化保护，强调可解释性和文化敏感性，为文化AI提供了实用的编程方法。

Abstract: Contemporary Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems remain constrained when confronted with culturally specific content, largely because cultural knowledge is under-represented in training corpora and the reasoning process is not rendered interpretable to end users. This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled. A curated knowledge base of Vietnamese cultural entities serves as an explicit source of background information, while a dual-modality explanation module combines attention-based visual evidence with structured, human-readable textual rationales. We further construct a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset sourced from public repositories and use it to demonstrate the practicality of programming-based methodologies for cultural AI. The resulting system provides transparent explanations that disclose both the computational rationale and the underlying cultural context, supporting education and cultural preservation with an emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity.

TL;DR: 提出DOC方法，通过正交梯度方向和动量更新增强对抗性攻击的多样性，提升视觉语言预训练模型在测试时的对抗鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对抗方法TTC由于优化目标差异，仅基于对抗输入的梯度生成反攻击，导致搜索空间狭窄，反攻击缺乏多样性，无法充分中和广泛的扰动

Method: 提出方向正交反攻击(DOC)，结合正交梯度方向和动量更新来扩展反攻击空间探索，增加扰动多样性，同时基于平均余弦相似度的方向敏感度评分来提升样本区分和自适应调节反攻击强度

Result: 在16个数据集上的广泛实验表明，DOC在各种攻击下提高了对抗鲁棒性，同时保持了竞争力的干净准确率

Conclusion: 增强反攻击的多样性和覆盖范围对于提升测试时防御的对抗鲁棒性至关重要，DOC方法通过正交梯度和动量更新有效实现了这一目标

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Conclusion: 该研究为组合增量学习提供了有效解决方案，能够持续提升模型的组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: UL-TTA是一种无需训练和反向传播的测试时适应框架，通过在线EM风格过程仅调整logit级参数（类别原型、先验和温度），在领域偏移下提升CLIP等视觉语言模型的准确性和校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法需要反向传播、协方差估计或大量内存，不适合流式和边缘场景。CLIP等模型在领域偏移下存在特征漂移、类别先验不匹配和严重校准错误问题。

Method: 冻结主干网络，仅在线更新logit级参数：使用选择性样本过滤、基于文本和Dirichlet先验的闭式贝叶斯更新原型和先验、解耦预测与校准温度、轻量防护机制防止长期漂移。

Result: 在多个大规模跨域和OOD基准测试中，相比零样本CLIP平均提升4.7%的top-1准确率，ECE降低20-30%，延迟开销小于8%，在长达20万样本的流式测试中无崩溃。

Conclusion: logit级贝叶斯适应足以在领域偏移下为视觉语言模型获得最先进的准确率-校准权衡，无需更新任何主干网络参数。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition by comparing image embeddings to text-derived class prototypes. However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse. Our results demonstrate that logit-level Bayesian adaptation is sufficient to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy-calibration trade-offs for VLMs under domain shift, without updating any backbone parameters.

Conclusion: DKDS数据集填补了草书体日本古籍文档处理中噪声问题的研究空白，为相关任务提供了新的基准，数据集和实现代码已公开。

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Conclusion: PIFF通过整合物理知识与数据驱动学习，能够准确捕捉降雨、地形、简化淹没模型与洪水之间的因果关系，为实时洪水测绘提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Flood mapping is crucial for assessing and mitigating flood impacts, yet traditional methods like numerical modeling and aerial photography face limitations in efficiency and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps. Using a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios ranging from 24 mm to 720 mm over 24 hours, our results demonstrate that PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response.

Conclusion: MACEval为大模型评估开辟了新方向，提供了一种可持续、自动化的动态评估框架。

Abstract: Hundreds of benchmarks dedicated to evaluating large models from multiple perspectives have been presented over the past few years. Albeit substantial efforts, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination in the ever-growing training corpus of large models, thereby undermining the credibility of the evaluation. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies. We hope that MACEval can broaden future directions of large model evaluation.

Result: 在多人物HMR中表现出色，MPJPE达到89.2mm，WA-MPJPE100达到112.6mm，展示了触觉垫在普遍、保护隐私的多人物动作识别方面的潜力。

Conclusion: PressTrack-HMR成功实现了仅基于压力信号的多人物全局人体网格恢复，并构建了MIP数据集促进多人物场景下基于压力的人类运动分析研究。

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Method: 通过扩散模型反演恢复初始噪声序列，发现真实视频和生成视频的初始噪声序列存在系统性差异。基于此构建初始噪声差异序列(INDS)，提取多领域、多尺度特征，结合特征优化和贝叶斯搜索调优的LightGBM分类器。

Result: 在仅使用单一生成器训练的情况下，DBINDS在GenVidBench基准测试中实现了强大的跨生成器性能，在有限数据设置下表现出良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DBINDS通过分析潜在空间动态而非像素特征，有效解决了AI生成视频检测中的泛化问题，为内容安全和取证分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在皮肤病诊断中的应用日益增多，但可靠的评估仍然是临床部署的主要瓶颈，需要开发临床意义明确、可重复且可扩展的评估方法。

Method: 构建DermBench基准数据集，包含4000个真实皮肤病图像和专家认证的诊断叙述，使用基于LLM的评判器对候选叙述进行评分；训练DermEval无参考多模态评估器，对图像和生成叙述进行结构化批判和评分。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

Method: 从信息论角度证明VJP构成输入特征关于类别标签的最小充分统计量，提出编码-解码视角，并设计空间信息瓶颈来最大化前景VJP与输入的互信息，同时最小化背景区域的互信息。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在六种解释方法上均实现了普遍改进，获得更好的前景集中和背景抑制效果，同时保持了分类准确率的提升。

Conclusion: 通过直接优化训练过程中的VJP空间结构，可以改善各种解释范式的可视化质量，实现空间信息流的解耦。

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically learn spatially entangled representations that conflate discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, thereby undermining model interpretability and robustness. We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.

Abstract: The Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) is an emerging paradigm for talking-face video compression. However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA. Ultimately, we establish an AGC FPGA prototype on the PYNQ-Z1 platform using the proposed scheme, achieving \textbf{24.9$\times$} and \textbf{4.1$\times$} higher energy efficiency against commercial Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), respectively. Specifically, only \textbf{11.7} microjoules ($\upmu$J) are required for one pixel reconstructed by this FPGA system.

Motivation: 现有能耗估计研究主要使用经典回归方法，少数深度学习研究未能区分神经网络架构与信号选择的作用，需要系统评估这两个方面。

Method: 比较经典基线方法与新型神经网络架构，评估单一信号、信号对和分组传感器输入在不同体力活动中的表现，使用Transformer、CNN和ResNet等模型。

Result: 分钟通气量是最佳单一信号，Transformer模型在所有活动中RMSE最低(0.87 W/kg)；低强度活动表现更好(RMSE低至0.29 W/kg)；高强度活动RMSE较大但标准化误差可比；存在显著的个体间差异。

Conclusion: 深度学习在能耗估计中表现优异，特别是Transformer架构；信号选择和模型架构都很重要；需要开发自适应建模策略来处理个体差异。

Abstract: Energy expenditure estimation aims to infer human metabolic rate from physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or accelerometer data, and has been studied primarily with classical regression methods. The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors. Finally, subject-level analysis highlights strong inter-individual variability, motivating the need for adaptive modeling strategies. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/Sarvibabakhani/deeplearning-biosignals-ee .

Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要依赖单模态视觉信息，缺乏知识多样性。CLIP的跨模态表示潜力尚未在知识蒸馏中得到充分探索。

Method: 融合传统教师和CLIP的logits和特征，结合CLIP的多提示文本指导，同时捕获数据集特定信息和语义丰富的视觉线索。

Conclusion: RichKD通过融合CLIP的跨模态知识，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果，证明了视觉-语言监督在知识蒸馏中的价值。

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

Conclusion: TDCNet通过有效提取和增强时空特征，能够准确检测移动红外小目标，在复杂背景下显著抑制伪运动杂波，提升检测性能。

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a critical role in practical applications, such as surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV-based search system. Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamPose3D是一个基于扩散模型的3D人体姿态估计框架，通过动作感知推理和时间想象来提升姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D人体姿态估计方法主要依赖几何线索并独立预测每一帧的姿态，这限制了它们解决模糊运动和泛化到真实场景的能力。受人类理解和预测运动的方式启发，需要结合动作感知和时间一致性建模。

Method: 提出DreamPose3D框架：1）使用从2D姿态序列提取的任务相关动作提示来动态调节去噪过程；2）引入表示编码器，将运动学关节亲和性融入注意力机制；3）幻觉姿态解码器在训练期间预测时间一致的3D姿态序列。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-3DHP基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。在广播棒球数据集上测试也表现出强大的鲁棒性，能有效处理模糊和嘈杂的2D输入，保持时间一致性并处理意图驱动的运动变化。

Conclusion: DreamPose3D通过结合动作感知推理和时间想象，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的性能和鲁棒性，特别是在处理模糊运动和真实场景时表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: vMFCoOp是一个基于超球面流形的框架，通过统一语义锚点对齐LLM和CLIP模型的语义偏差，实现稳健的生物医学提示学习和优越的小样本分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临LLM与CLIP模型之间的语义错位问题，缺乏跨基础模型的可扩展性，且传统欧几里得空间优化无法建模统一表示或应用局部几何约束，在复杂生物医学成像中会放大模态差距并破坏小样本适应的稳定性。

Method: 提出vMFCoOp框架，在共享超球面流形上反向估计冯·米塞斯-费希尔分布，通过统一语义锚点对齐任意LLM和CLIP骨干网络的语义偏差。

Result: 在14个医学数据集、12种医学成像模态和13个解剖区域上表现一致改进，在准确性、泛化性和临床适用性方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为生物医学提示学习提供了稳健的解决方案，未来将扩展到更多下游应用，相关资源将通过GitHub共享。

Abstract: Recent advances in context optimization (CoOp) guided by large language model (LLM)-distilled medical semantic priors offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering and full fine-tuning for adapting biomedical CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs). However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability. This work will be continuously expanded to encompass more downstream applications, and the corresponding resources are intended to be shared through https://github.com/VinyehShaw/UniEqui.

TL;DR: RF-DETR是一个轻量级的目标检测变换器，通过神经架构搜索在目标数据集上发现精度-延迟帕累托曲线，显著提升了实时检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇检测器在COCO上表现优异，但在包含预训练中未见类别的真实世界数据集上泛化能力不足。现有方法通常需要对大型视觉语言模型进行微调，效率低下。

Method: 提出RF-DETR，通过权重共享的神经架构搜索，在目标数据集上微调预训练基础网络，无需重新训练即可评估数千种网络配置的精度-延迟权衡。重新审视NAS的"可调旋钮"以提升DETR在不同目标域的迁移性。

Result: RF-DETR在COCO和Roboflow100-VL上显著优于现有最先进实时方法。RF-DETR (nano)在COCO上达到48.0 AP，比D-FINE (nano)高5.3 AP且延迟相似；RF-DETR (2x-large)在Roboflow100-VL上比GroundingDINO (tiny)高1.2 AP，速度快20倍。RF-DETR (2x-large)是首个在COCO上超过60 AP的实时检测器。

Conclusion: RF-DETR通过高效的神经架构搜索方法，在保持实时性能的同时显著提升了目标检测精度，为开放词汇检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary detectors achieve impressive performance on COCO, but often fail to generalize to real-world datasets with out-of-distribution classes not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the "tunable knobs" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves on prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast. To the best of our knowledge, RF-DETR (2x-large) is the first real-time detector to surpass 60 AP on COCO. Our code is at https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了ST-CLIP模型，将时空信息整合到CLIP视觉语言模型中，用于交通场景理解任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究往往将交通场景理解视为普通图像理解任务，忽略了时空信息以及交通场景不同方面之间的相互关系。

Method: 基于CLIP模型，设计了时空上下文感知多角度提示学习方法（SCAMP），包括动态时空上下文表示模块和双层时空感知多角度提示学习模块。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，在复杂场景理解场景中具有优越性能，采用少样本学习策略。

Conclusion: 这是首次将时空信息整合到视觉语言模型中促进交通场景理解任务的尝试，证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Nowadays, navigation and ride-sharing apps have collected numerous images with spatio-temporal data. A core technology for analyzing such images, associated with spatiotemporal information, is Traffic Scene Understanding (TSU), which aims to provide a comprehensive description of the traffic scene. Unlike traditional spatio-temporal data analysis tasks, the dependence on both spatio-temporal and visual-textual data introduces distinct challenges to TSU task. However, recent research often treats TSU as a common image understanding task, ignoring the spatio-temporal information and overlooking the interrelations between different aspects of the traffic scene. To address these issues, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Enhanced Model based on CILP (ST-CLIP) for TSU. Our model uses the classic vision-language model, CLIP, as the backbone, and designs a Spatio-temporal Context Aware Multiaspect Prompt (SCAMP) learning method to incorporate spatiotemporal information into TSU. The prompt learning method consists of two components: A dynamic spatio-temporal context representation module that extracts representation vectors of spatio-temporal data for each traffic scene image, and a bi-level ST-aware multi-aspect prompt learning module that integrates the ST-context representation vectors into word embeddings of prompts for the CLIP model. The second module also extracts low-level visual features and image-wise high-level semantic features to exploit interactive relations among different aspects of traffic scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate spatio-temporal information into visionlanguage models to facilitate TSU task. Experiments on two realworld datasets demonstrate superior performance in the complex scene understanding scenarios with a few-shot learning strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频描述自动化方法局限于高质量电影内容且需要人工标注的真实音频描述，需要扩展到其他领域如体育，同时解决领域特定数据缺乏的问题。

Method: 在公开电影音频描述数据集上微调视频大语言模型，学习音频描述的叙述结构和惯例；推理时结合多模态上下文线索（球员身份、足球事件动作、评论）和输入提示生成完整音频描述文本。

Result: 开发了MCAD系统，在电影和足球数据集上进行了深入分析，验证了ARGE-AD指标的有效性，并贡献了100个足球比赛片段的专家标注音频描述。

Conclusion: 成功将音频描述生成扩展到体育领域，提出了有效的评估指标，为视觉障碍人士提供了更广泛的内容可访问性支持。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (AD) are essential for making visual content accessible to individuals with visual impairments. Recent works have shown a promising step towards automating AD, but they have been limited to describing high-quality movie content using human-annotated ground truth AD in the process. In this work, we present an end-to-end pipeline, MCAD, that extends AD generation beyond movies to the domain of sports, with a focus on soccer games, without relying on ground truth AD. To address the absence of domain-specific AD datasets, we fine-tune a Video Large Language Model on publicly available movie AD datasets so that it learns the narrative structure and conventions of AD. During inference, MCAD incorporates multimodal contextual cues such as player identities, soccer events and actions, and commentary from the game. These cues, combined with input prompts to the fine-tuned VideoLLM, allow the system to produce complete AD text for each video segment. We further introduce a new evaluation metric, ARGE-AD, designed to accurately assess the quality of generated AD. ARGE-AD evaluates the generated AD for the presence of five characteristics: (i) usage of people's names, (ii) mention of actions and events, (iii) appropriate length of AD, (iv) absence of pronouns, and (v) overlap from commentary or subtitles. We present an in-depth analysis of our approach on both movie and soccer datasets. We also validate the use of this metric to quantitatively comment on the quality of generated AD using our metric across domains. Additionally, we contribute audio descriptions for 100 soccer game clips annotated by two AD experts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用LLM和AMR图将无约束英语翻译成ASP程序的新方法，用于解决逻辑谜题，生成完整的ASP程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP是一种强大的组合问题解决工具，但需要学习语法。随着非程序员与代码交互的需求增加，需要更易用的自然语言到ASP的转换方法。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，然后通过AMR图解析简化语言并系统生成ASP约束，最小化LLM的作用。

Result: 系统成功创建了完整的ASP程序来解决组合逻辑问题，展示了在逻辑谜题上的能力。

Conclusion: 这是创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言到复杂逻辑问题解决系统的第一个重要步骤。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Motivation: ARC-AGI是人类轻松解决但AI系统极其困难的生成式少样本流体智能基准，受神经科学和心理学中人类智能建模方法启发，需要开发认知合理的求解器。

Method: 使用向量符号代数(VSA)的神经符号方法，集成系统1直觉和系统2推理，通过以对象为中心的程序合成，利用VSA表示抽象对象、指导解决方案搜索并实现样本高效的神经学习。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-1-Train上得分10.8%，在ARC-AGI-1-Eval上得分3.0%；在Sort-of-ARC上得分94.5%，在1D-ARC上得分83.1%（以极小计算成本超越GPT-4）。

Conclusion: 这是首个将VSA应用于ARC-AGI的方法，开发了迄今为止最认知合理的ARC-AGI求解器，在保持高效性的同时实现了可解释的抽象推理。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

TL;DR: 本文提出QDIN架构，将强化学习系统重新设计为可查询的推理引擎，能够回答关于环境的多种查询，而不仅仅是最大化奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习只关注最大化奖励，但训练好的智能体实际上编码了丰富的环境知识（可达性、距离、价值等），现有架构无法高效暴露这些信息。

Method: 引入查询条件确定性推理网络(QDIN)，为不同类型的查询（策略、可达性、路径、比较）设计专门的神经模块，将查询作为一等公民处理。

Result: 实验显示推理准确率可达接近完美水平（99%可达性IoU），即使控制性能仍不理想（31%回报），表明世界知识表示与控制表示存在根本性解耦。

Conclusion: 这项工作为从设计之初就作为可查询知识库的RL系统建立了研究议程，对可解释性、验证和人机协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的POMDP规划算法——神经价值迭代，通过神经网络表示价值函数，解决了传统方法在大规模问题中的计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统POMDP求解器使用α向量表示价值函数，但在大规模问题中计算成本过高，因为每个α向量都是|S|维的。需要一种更高效的方法来处理大规模POMDP问题。

Method: 利用PWLC特性，将POMDP价值函数表示为有限个神经网络的集合，结合神经网络的泛化能力和经典价值迭代框架，提出神经价值迭代算法。

Result: 该方法在现有离线求解器无法处理的大规模POMDP中仍能获得接近最优的解。

Conclusion: 神经网络表示为POMDP规划提供了可扩展的解决方案，能够有效处理传统方法难以解决的大规模问题。

Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

Motivation: 现有LLM监督微调方法只能学习表面教学模式，缺乏动态适应能力；强化学习方法面临无法区分学生真实理解与简单模仿、无法感知学生认知状态演变的挑战。

Method: 提出单向认知优化(UCO)方法，采用多轮交互强化学习范式，包含两个协同奖励函数：进度奖励评估学生从困惑到理解的认知进步，支架奖励动态识别学生的最近发展区(ZPD)。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO模型优于所有同等规模模型，性能与先进闭源模型相当。

Conclusion: UCO方法通过认知导向的奖励机制有效解决了LLM作为智能导师的动态适应问题，在数学教育任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/UCO.

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物声学AI系统通过transformer架构和基础模型取得了令人印象深刻的跨物种性能，但这些方法忽视了一个基本问题：当一种递归认知（AI系统）遇到其他物种的递归通信过程时会发生什么？

Method: 基于哲学家Yuk Hui关于递归性和偶然性的研究，论证AI系统不是中立的模式检测器，而是递归认知代理，其自身的信息处理可能系统性地模糊或扭曲其他物种的通信结构。

Result: 揭示了双重偶然性问题：每个物种的通信都通过偶然的生态和进化条件产生，而AI系统则通过自身偶然的架构和训练条件处理这些信号。

Conclusion: 解决这一挑战需要将生物声学AI从通用模式识别重新概念化为不同形式递归认知之间的外交接触，这对模型设计、评估框架和研究方法都有重要意义。

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaCast是一个结合人类智慧与大型语言模型智能的交互式时间序列预测框架，通过分阶段协作提升预测准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法缺乏人类专家的交互、推理和适应能力，限制了在复杂现实环境中的实用性

Method: 两阶段框架：1)自动化预测准备阶段构建多源认知基础；2)生成推理和反思优化阶段进行元推理循环和策略优化

Result: 在短期和长期数据集上的广泛实验表明，AlphaCast在预测准确性方面始终优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人类智慧与LLM智能的协同推理，将预测重新定义为交互过程，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

*Preesha Gehlot,Anna Rapberger,Fabrizio Russo,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于图神经网络(GNN)的方法来近似计算基于假设的论证(ABA)中的可信接受度，通过依赖图表示ABA框架，开发了ABAGCN和ABAGAT两种架构，在ICCMA 2023基准测试中表现优于现有GNN基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于假设的论证(ABA)是一种强大的结构化论证形式，但在稳定语义下精确计算大型框架的扩展是难以处理的，需要开发可扩展的近似推理方法。

Method: 将ABA框架建模为依赖图，编码假设、声明和规则作为节点，使用异构边标签区分支持、推导和攻击关系。提出了ABAGCN和ABAGAT两种GNN架构，分别使用残差异构卷积层和注意力层来学习节点嵌入。

Result: ABAGCN和ABAGAT在ICCMA实例上实现了高达0.71的节点级F1分数，优于从抽象论证文献中改编的最先进GNN基线。扩展重构算法在小ABAF上F1超过0.85，在大型框架上保持约0.58的F1。

Conclusion: 这项工作为结构化论证中的可扩展近似推理开辟了新途径，证明了GNN在ABA框架中近似可信接受度的有效性。

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

*Alvin Chauhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出通过结构化多智能体管道实现渐进式、增量式、顺序式(GIS)搜索来增强大语言模型的推理能力，并验证了递归精化(RR)作为实现GIS搜索的有效方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型表现出卓越的流畅性，但研究者仍在努力从中提取更强的推理能力。基于对LLM计算的搜索式理解，本文旨在建立一个系统化框架来理解LLM推理和优化。

Method: 设计实验比较简单线性管道与包含递归精化层的复杂结构化管道。多智能体模型基于三位美国开国元勋的历史人物构建，使用RAG增强语料库，对三个当代政治问题生成回答。采用递归精化方法，包括自我批评、对抗性压力测试和整合关键反馈。

Result: 复杂模型在所有九个测试案例中均优于简单模型，平均仲裁者评分为88.3对71.7。复杂模型的论证在分析深度、结构细微差别和策略框架方面更优。

Conclusion: 递归精化是通过GIS搜索增强LLM推理的强大架构特征，高质量推理是受控的增量搜索过程。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

TL;DR: MAKER系统首次成功实现了超过100万步的LLM任务执行且零错误，通过极端任务分解和微代理机制解决了LLM在长程任务中的扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理和工具使用方面取得突破，但在执行人类、组织和社会规模的扩展过程时存在持续错误率问题，无法实现长程任务的可靠执行。

Method: 采用极端任务分解策略，将任务分解为可由专注微代理处理的子任务，通过模块化设计和多代理投票机制实现高效错误校正。

Result: 成功解决了超过100万步的LLM任务且零错误，理论上可扩展到更高水平，证明了大规模分解代理过程(MDAPs)的可行性。

Conclusion: 相比持续改进现有LLMs，大规模分解代理过程可能为组织和社会层面的问题提供有效解决方案，实现了LLM任务执行的重大突破。

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为Argus的运行时韧性框架，用于增强端到端自动驾驶系统的安全性，通过持续监控轨迹并主动缓解驾驶危险来防止安全违规。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统在部署到公共道路时面临各种驾驶危险，可能损害安全性和系统性能，因此需要增强系统的韧性能力。

Method: Argus框架持续监控ADS生成的轨迹，当EGO车辆被认为不安全时，通过危险缓解器无缝接管控制。

Result: 与TCP、UniAD和VAD三个先进ADS集成后，Argus将驾驶评分平均提高150.30%，防止64.38%的违规，时间开销很小。

Conclusion: Argus能有效提升自动驾驶系统的韧性，显著改善驾驶性能并预防安全违规，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OR-R1是一个数据高效的训练框架，用于自动化优化建模和求解，通过监督微调和测试时组相对策略优化，仅需1/10的数据量就能达到67.7%的平均求解准确率，超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的优化建模方法需要大量标注或合成数据，成本高且可扩展性差，需要开发数据效率更高的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：首先使用监督微调从有限标注数据学习问题建模和代码生成模式，然后通过测试时组相对策略优化提升能力和一致性。

Result: OR-R1达到67.7%的平均求解准确率，仅需ORLM方法1/10的数据量，在100个合成样本下仍能超越ORLM 2.4%以上，TGRPO带来额外3.1%-6.4%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: OR-R1为自动化运筹优化问题建模和求解提供了鲁棒、可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，显著降低了工业应用的专家知识和数据门槛。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

*Ziwei Wang,Leyang Yang,Xiaoxuan Tang,Sheng Zhou,Dajun Chen,Wei Jiang,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了历史感知推理框架(HAR)，通过反思错误和获取情景推理知识来增强GUI代理的短期记忆能力，解决现有方法对历史交互不敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在显式推理中表现出弱短期记忆，将链式交互视为离散的屏幕理解，缺乏对情景中历史交互的感知，这限制了GUI自动化的性能。

Method: 构建反思学习场景、合成定制修正指南、设计混合RL奖励函数，开发了端到端模型HAR-GUI-3B，将推理模式从历史无关转变为历史感知。

Result: 在多个GUI相关基准测试上的综合评估证明了该方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HAR框架通过增强短期记忆和屏幕细节感知，显著提升了GUI代理在长视野交互中的推理能力。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ProBench移动端基准测试，包含200多个GUI任务，通过引入过程相关任务评估和过程提供者机制，解决了现有基准测试仅关注最终状态而忽略中间步骤的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理基准测试仅通过检查最终屏幕状态来评估任务完成情况，但GUI操作任务包含多个链式步骤，且关键信息不一定呈现在最后几页中。虽然已有研究开始纳入中间步骤评估，但准确自动捕获过程信息仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出ProBench移动端基准测试，包含200多个挑战性GUI任务。在保留传统状态相关任务评估的基础上，扩展数据集以包含过程相关任务，并设计专门的评估方法。引入过程提供者自动提供准确的过程信息，实现精确的代理性能评估。

Result: 对先进GUI代理的评估揭示了在真实世界GUI场景中的显著局限性。这些缺陷普遍存在于多样化模型中，包括大规模通用模型和较小的GUI特定模型。详细的错误分析进一步暴露了几个普遍问题。

Conclusion: ProBench基准测试为GUI代理评估提供了更全面的框架，通过过程相关任务评估揭示了现有模型的局限性，为未来改进指明了具体方向。

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

Conclusion: 该方法从理论上证明了新奖励在方差减少和改进收敛性方面的优越性，在实践中证明了其有效性和token效率，为解决过度思考问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

TL;DR: MedFuse是一个处理不规则临床时间序列的框架，通过MuFuse模块使用乘法融合来建模特征间的高阶依赖关系，在多个真实数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床时间序列数据存在不规则采样、缺失值和异质特征动态等问题，现有嵌入策略通常通过加法操作结合特征身份和值嵌入，限制了捕捉值依赖特征交互的能力。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse模块，通过乘法调制融合值和特征嵌入，在保留特征特定信息的同时建模跨特征的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在涵盖重症和慢性护理的三个真实数据集上的实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务上始终优于最先进的基线方法。学习表示的分析进一步证明乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse为建模不规则临床时间序列提供了一个可推广的方法，乘法融合机制有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

Result: 在四个真实世界交通数据集上的实验表明，HyperD实现了最先进的预测精度，在干扰下具有更好的鲁棒性，且计算效率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HyperD通过解耦周期性和非周期性分量，有效解决了交通预测中的空间依赖性和多尺度模式问题，为智能交通系统提供了更准确和鲁棒的预测方案。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出从"模型训练"转向"模型培养"的新范式，将价值对齐从模型开发之初就融入其中，通过重新设计训练语料库来实现知识、技能和价值观的深度融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法只在模型核心能力建立后才进行价值对齐，导致模型容易失准且缺乏深层次价值体系。在大型语言模型能力开始超越人类的背景下，需要从根本上改变训练方式。

Method: 重新设计训练语料库：采用第一人称视角重构训练数据、将信息重新情境化为生活经验、模拟社会互动、对训练数据进行支架式排序。

Result: 预期实现从第一个训练标记开始就对价值观的早期承诺，使知识、技能和价值观内在难以分离。

Conclusion: 在AI能力超越人类的生态系统中，这种从模型开发之初就融入价值对齐的"模型培养"范式具有关键必要性。

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

*Stine Beltoft,Lukas Galke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张开发专门为定性研究设计的AI系统，以弥补当前AI在定性方法中的不足，这些系统需要具备透明、可复现和隐私友好的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要推动定量方法发展，而定性研究被忽视。研究人员不得不依赖通用AI工具如ChatGPT进行定性分析，但这些工具存在偏见、不透明、不可复现和隐私问题，导致定性维度在科学理解中未能充分整合。

Method: 通过回顾近期文献，展示如何通过增强定性能力来改进现有自动化发现流程，并识别安全定性AI在多学科和混合方法研究中的关键机会。

Result: 发现现有AI系统在定性研究方面存在严重不足，需要专门设计的系统来支持解释性研究。

Conclusion: 需要从零开始开发专门针对定性研究的AI系统，这些系统必须透明、可复现且隐私友好，以促进多学科和混合方法研究的进步。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

*Ali Taheri,Alireza Taban,Sadegh Soudjani,Ashutosh Trivedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的智能体框架，用于自动合成动态系统的屏障证书，解决传统方法在可扩展性、模板依赖和手动专业知识方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统屏障证书合成方法存在可扩展性差、依赖精心设计的模板、需要大量手动专业知识等问题，需要探索是否能通过语言模型捕捉和操作化专家推理。

Method: 引入基于LLM的智能体框架，使用自然语言推理来提出、优化和验证候选证书，结合LLM驱动的模板发现和SMT验证，支持屏障-控制器协同合成。

Result: 在BarrierBench基准测试中，该框架在生成有效证书方面达到超过90%的成功率，验证了LLM引导屏障合成的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过发布BarrierBench和相关工具链，旨在建立社区测试平台，推动语言推理与动态系统形式验证的集成。

Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.
  The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench

TL;DR: 评估2025年三个前沿LLM（DeepSeek R1、Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5）在PDDL规划和推理任务上的表现，发现GPT-5在标准PDDL领域与LAMA规划器竞争激烈，但在混淆测试中所有模型性能下降但优于前代模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估前沿LLM在端到端规划任务中的推理能力，了解它们与专业规划器之间的性能差距。

Method: 使用国际规划竞赛学习赛道中的PDDL领域和任务子集，在标准PDDL和混淆PDDL两种条件下测试模型性能，并与LAMA规划器进行对比。

Result: GPT-5在标准PDDL领域解决任务的能力与LAMA规划器相当；在混淆测试中所有LLM性能下降但降幅小于之前报道的其他模型；相比前代LLM有显著改进。

Conclusion: 前沿LLM在规划推理方面取得实质性进步，与规划器在挑战性基准上的性能差距正在缩小。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Motivation: 在高维领域中进行科学发现需要访问学习表示中的信息，但现有方法在解缠潜在子空间方面存在局限。

Method: 基于潜在流匹配与分类器自由引导，显式分离条件信息与残差表示来解缠潜在子空间。

Result: 在合成2D高斯问题、彩色MNIST和Galaxy10天文数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够访问高维数据的有意义特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析、控制和重新利用潜在表示提供了简单而强大的机制，为使用生成模型进行科学探索开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrochetBench是一个评估多模态大语言模型在钩针编织领域进行细粒度、低层次程序推理能力的基准测试，强调从描述转向执行，要求模型识别针法、选择结构适当的指令并生成可编译的钩针程序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注高层次描述或视觉问答，缺乏对实际执行能力的评估。CrochetBench旨在填补这一空白，通过评估模型在真实世界创造性领域中的程序能力。

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行的功能评估。基准测试涵盖针法分类、指令基础、自然语言到DSL翻译和图像到DSL翻译等任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，性能急剧下降，暴露了模型在长距离符号推理和3D感知程序合成方面的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，并突显了在真实世界创造性领域中表面理解与可执行精度之间的差距。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

TL;DR: 提出一种架构无关的AI安全方法，通过聚合多个生成模型来增强安全性，使聚合模型继承给定规模中最安全子集的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多AI安全方法依赖检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险仅通过检查无法检测。需要一种补充方法来增强安全性。

Method: 提出共识采样算法，给定k个模型和提示，实现与最安全的s个模型平均风险相当的风险水平，当模型间缺乏足够共识时选择弃权。算法利用模型计算输出概率的能力。

Result: 当足够多的模型安全且表现出足够共识时，可以限制弃权概率。算法从Vyas等人的可证明版权保护算法获得灵感。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种新的模型无关AI安全方法，通过放大集合中未知子模型的安全保证来创建单个可靠模型。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI依赖符号处理和数据驱动模型，而物理AI将智能理解为身体、环境和经验之间真实互动的涌现现象，需要建立新的理论基础来描述物理体现的智能系统。

Method: 提出了六个基本原则：体现、感知、运动行动、学习、自主性和情境敏感性，这些原则构成一个封闭的控制循环，能量、信息、控制和情境在其中持续互动。

Result: 建立了物理AI的理论框架，展示了六个原则如何作为封闭控制循环相互作用，使系统能够从物理经验而非数据库中生成意义。

Conclusion: 物理AI将智能理解为物理体现的过程，学习不是参数调整而是智能体与环境之间结构耦合的变化，这一范式转变通过康复机器人实例得到验证。

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性优化在多智能体设置中能有效发现鲁棒和多样化的策略，但在合作设置中会导致智能体非理性地自毁，阻碍任务完成和学习进程。

Method: 开发了Rational Policy Gradient (RPG)算法，在修改后的游戏版本中训练智能体最大化自身奖励，使用对手塑造技术优化对抗性目标，确保智能体保持理性。

Result: RPG方法能够在多种合作和一般和环境中实现强大性能，成功避免了自毁行为，能够发现对抗性示例、提高鲁棒性和适应性，并学习多样化策略。

Conclusion: RPO形式化方法和RPG算法有效解决了对抗性优化在合作设置中的自毁问题，扩展了现有对抗性优化算法的应用范围。

Abstract: Adversarial optimization algorithms that explicitly search for flaws in agents' policies have been successfully applied to finding robust and diverse policies in multi-agent settings. However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贪婪搜索方法如GBFS和EHC在面临启发式局部极小值或平台等无信息启发式区域(UHRs)时表现不佳，需要有效的逃离机制。

Method: 理论推导BrFS和RRW逃离UHR的预期运行时间，创建EHC-RRW变体使用RRW替代BrFS，并在PDDL规划基准上进行实验比较。

Result: 确定了RRW比BrFS更快的条件，EHC-RRW在EHC有效的场景下具有强预期运行时间保证，实验验证了两种方法在逃离UHRs中的相对有效性。

Conclusion: 重启随机游走(RRW)在某些条件下比广度优先搜索(BrFS)能更有效地逃离无信息启发式区域，EHC-RRW变体提供了更好的理论保证和实际性能。

Abstract: Greedy search methods like Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and Enforced Hill-Climbing (EHC) often struggle when faced with Uninformed Heuristic Regions (UHRs) like heuristic local minima or plateaus. In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CGAR是一种新的训练方法，通过将课程学习应用于架构深度而非传统数据排序，显著提升了递归推理模型的训练效率。该方法包含渐进深度课程和分层监督加权两个组件，在Sudoku-Extreme数据集上实现了1.71倍训练加速和42%成本降低，同时仅损失0.63%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 递归推理模型虽然性能优异，但训练计算成本高昂（约36 GPU小时/数据集），限制了其广泛应用和研究。需要开发更高效的训练方法来降低计算成本。

Method: CGAR包含两个核心组件：1）渐进深度课程：在训练过程中动态调整递归深度，从浅到深配置，防止早期过拟合并降低计算成本；2）分层监督加权：对监督步骤应用指数衰减的重要性权重，使损失权重与观察到的梯度幅度衰减保持一致。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme数据集（423,168个测试谜题）上，CGAR实现了1.71倍训练加速（从10.93小时降至6.38小时，成本降低42%），准确率仅下降0.63%（从86.65%降至86.02%）。渐进深度课程单独使用可实现2.26倍加速和85.47%准确率。

Conclusion: CGAR证明了在架构深度上应用原则性课程学习能够有效训练递归推理模型，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率，使在普通硬件上训练成为可能。

Abstract: Recursive reasoning models achieve remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through iterative refinement, enabling tiny networks to match large language models thousands of times their size. However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统矩量法受限于静态几何定义的基函数（如RWG基），无法适应复杂电磁问题。论文旨在开发可学习的基函数表示，提升电磁建模的灵活性和准确性。

Method: 提出PhyKAN方法，将RWG基推广为可学习的自适应基函数。该方法结合局部KAN分支和嵌入格林函数先验的全局分支，保持物理一致性，基于电场积分方程推导。

Result: 在典型几何结构上，PhyKAN实现了低于0.01的重构误差，并能准确进行无监督雷达散射截面预测。

Conclusion: PhyKAN为经典求解器与现代神经网络模型之间提供了可解释、物理一致的桥梁，在电磁建模中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The Method of Moments (MoM) is constrained by the usage of static, geometry-defined basis functions, such as the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis. This letter reframes electromagnetic modeling around a learnable basis representation rather than solving for the coefficients over a fixed basis. We first show that the RWG basis is essentially a static and piecewise-linear realization of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Inspired by this insight, we propose PhyKAN, a physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that generalizes RWG into a learnable and adaptive basis family. Derived from the EFIE, PhyKAN integrates a local KAN branch with a global branch embedded with Green's function priors to preserve physical consistency. It is demonstrated that, across canonical geometries, PhyKAN achieves sub-0.01 reconstruction errors as well as accurate, unsupervised radar cross section predictions, offering an interpretable, physics-consistent bridge between classical solvers and modern neural network models for electromagnetic modeling.

Abstract: The first tabular foundation model, TabPFN, and its successor TabPFNv2 have impacted tabular AI substantially, with dozens of methods building on it and hundreds of applications across different use cases. This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment. This new release will immediately strengthen the performance of the many applications and methods already built on the TabPFN ecosystem.

TL;DR: PEGNet是一个物理嵌入图网络，通过将PDE动力学嵌入到图神经网络的消息传递中，解决了传统数据驱动方法在物理一致性和误差累积方面的问题。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值求解器计算成本高，而现有数据驱动方法存在误差累积和物理一致性不足的问题，特别是在多物理场和复杂几何中。

Method: 提出PEGNet，通过将PDE动力学（如对流、粘性、扩散）嵌入到不同的消息函数中，重新设计图神经网络架构，并采用分层架构捕获多尺度特征，在损失函数中加入物理正则化。

Result: 在呼吸气流和药物输送等基准测试中，PEGNet在长期预测精度和物理一致性方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PEGNet通过物理嵌入的消息传递机制，能够产生更稳定和物理一致的解，为PDE求解提供了有效的数据驱动替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulations of physical phenomena governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are important for scientific and engineering progress. While traditional numerical solvers are powerful, they are often computationally expensive. Recently, data-driven methods have emerged as alternatives, but they frequently suffer from error accumulation and limited physical consistency, especially in multiphysics and complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PEGNet, a Physics-Embedded Graph Network that incorporates PDE-guided message passing to redesign the graph neural network architecture. By embedding key PDE dynamics like convection, viscosity, and diffusion into distinct message functions, the model naturally integrates physical constraints into its forward propagation, producing more stable and physically consistent solutions. Additionally, a hierarchical architecture is employed to capture multi-scale features, and physical regularization is integrated into the loss function to further enforce adherence to governing physics. We evaluated PEGNet on benchmarks, including custom datasets for respiratory airflow and drug delivery, showing significant improvements in long-term prediction accuracy and physical consistency over existing methods.

*David Sanchez,Holly Lopez,Michelle Buraczyk,Anantaa Kotal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAIRPLAI是一个将人类监督集成到机器学习系统设计和部署中的实用框架，通过隐私-公平前沿、交互式利益相关者输入和差分隐私审计循环，平衡准确性、隐私和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在医疗、金融、招聘等关键领域的应用，仅关注准确性已不足够，还需要同时保证公平性、隐私保护和问责制。但现有方法存在隐私保护可能加剧不公平、公平干预依赖敏感数据、自动化流程忽视人类判断等问题。

Method: FAIRPLAI框架包含三个核心组件：(1)构建隐私-公平前沿，透明展示准确性、隐私保证和群体结果之间的权衡；(2)支持交互式利益相关者输入，让决策者根据领域需求选择公平标准和操作点；(3)嵌入差分私有审计循环，允许人类审查解释和边缘案例而不损害数据安全。

Result: 在基准数据集上的应用表明，FAIRPLAI在保持强大隐私保护的同时，相对于自动化基线减少了公平性差异，并为从业者提供了管理准确性、隐私和公平性竞争需求的直观可解释流程。

Conclusion: 通过在关键位置嵌入人类判断，FAIRPLAI为实现在实践中有效、负责任且可信赖的机器学习系统提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: As machine learning systems move from theory to practice, they are increasingly tasked with decisions that affect healthcare access, financial opportunities, hiring, and public services. In these contexts, accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - models must also be fair to different groups, protect individual privacy, and remain accountable to stakeholders. Achieving all three is difficult: differential privacy can unintentionally worsen disparities, fairness interventions often rely on sensitive data that privacy restricts, and automated pipelines ignore that fairness is ultimately a human and contextual judgment. We introduce FAIRPLAI (Fair and Private Learning with Active Human Influence), a practical framework that integrates human oversight into the design and deployment of machine learning systems. FAIRPLAI works in three ways: (1) it constructs privacy-fairness frontiers that make trade-offs between accuracy, privacy guarantees, and group outcomes transparent; (2) it enables interactive stakeholder input, allowing decision-makers to select fairness criteria and operating points that reflect their domain needs; and (3) it embeds a differentially private auditing loop, giving humans the ability to review explanations and edge cases without compromising individual data security. Applied to benchmark datasets, FAIRPLAI consistently preserves strong privacy protections while reducing fairness disparities relative to automated baselines. More importantly, it provides a straightforward, interpretable process for practitioners to manage competing demands of accuracy, privacy, and fairness in socially impactful applications. By embedding human judgment where it matters most, FAIRPLAI offers a pathway to machine learning systems that are effective, responsible, and trustworthy in practice.

TL;DR: 提出了LLM-ABS框架来研究大语言模型在独裁者游戏中的行为，发现模型对公平有强烈偏好，且系统提示对行为有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了系统提示在塑造LLM行为中的关键作用，且结果对提示的微小变化很敏感，需要建立更稳健的行为研究基线。

Method: 提出LLM-ABS框架：探索不同系统提示对模型行为的影响、使用中性提示变体获得更可靠的代理偏好洞察、分析LLM代理对开放式指令响应的语言特征。

Result: 代理通常表现出强烈的公平偏好，系统提示对其行为有显著影响。从语言角度看，模型以不同方式表达其响应。

Conclusion: 尽管提示敏感性仍是持续挑战，但提出的框架为LLM代理行为研究提供了稳健基础。

Abstract: In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior. From a linguistic perspective, we identify that models express their responses differently. Although prompt sensitivity remains a persistent challenge, our proposed framework demonstrates a robust foundation for LLM agent behavior studies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市拥堵导致车辆移动效率低下，加剧温室气体排放和城市空气污染。虽然排放宏观基本图(eMFD)能够捕捉网络层面的排放与聚合交通变量之间的关系，但由于历史数据限制，经验推导的eMFD模型稀少。

Method: 利用探测车辆获取的大规模精细交通和排放数据，应用机器学习方法预测网络范围的排放率与交通关系。

Result: 开发了数据分析框架和见解，生成数据驱动的eMFD，并深入理解其对网络、基础设施、土地利用和车辆特征的位置依赖性。

Conclusion: 该研究使交通管理部门能够测量给定出行需求下的城市交通碳排放，并优化特定位置的交通管理和规划决策，以减少网络范围的排放。

Abstract: Urban congestions cause inefficient movement of vehicles and exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution. Macroscopic emission fundamental diagram (eMFD)captures an orderly relationship among emission and aggregated traffic variables at the network level, allowing for real-time monitoring of region-wide emissions and optimal allocation of travel demand to existing networks, reducing urban congestion and associated emissions. However, empirically derived eMFD models are sparse due to historical data limitation. Leveraging a large-scale and granular traffic and emission data derived from probe vehicles, this study is the first to apply machine learning methods to predict the network wide emission rate to traffic relationship in U.S. urban areas at a large scale. The analysis framework and insights developed in this work generate data-driven eMFDs and a deeper understanding of their location dependence on network, infrastructure, land use, and vehicle characteristics, enabling transportation authorities to measure carbon emissions from urban transport of given travel demand and optimize location specific traffic management and planning decisions to mitigate network-wide emissions.

Motivation: 研究图粗化问题在Gromov-Wasserstein几何框架下的解决方案，旨在通过节点合并来减少图规模同时最小化失真

Method: GPC算法迭代合并局部失真最小的节点对；KGPC算法基于成对失真度量进行聚类，直接合并节点簇

Result: 在六个大规模数据集和下游聚类任务上验证，提出的方法在广泛参数和场景下优于现有方法

Conclusion: 基于Gromov-Wasserstein几何的图粗化方法有效，提供了最优粗化条件保证，并在实验中表现出优越性能

Abstract: We study the problem of graph coarsening within the Gromov-Wasserstein geometry. Specifically, we propose two algorithms that leverage a novel representation of the distortion induced by merging pairs of nodes. The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing approaches on a wide range of parameters and scenarios.

Abstract: Using Frequency-domain Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRRs), we extend a Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA) encoding of Lisp 1.5 with primitives for arithmetic operations using Residue Hyperdimensional Computing (RHC). Encoding a Turing-complete syntax over a high-dimensional vector space increases the expressivity of neural network states, enabling network states to contain arbitrarily structured representations that are inherently interpretable. We discuss the potential applications of the VSA encoding in machine learning tasks, as well as the importance of encoding structured representations and designing neural networks whose behavior is sensitive to the structure of their representations in virtue of attaining more general intelligent agents than exist at present.

TL;DR: BayesQ是一个基于贝叶斯后验期望损失优化的后训练量化框架，通过高斯后验拟合、协方差白化、码本设计和混合精度分配，在3.0/3.5/4.0比特权重下显著提升ResNet-50和BERT-base的量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量化方法未考虑权重不确定性，BayesQ首次在后验期望损失框架下优化量化，将低比特量化重新定义为不确定性感知的风险最小化问题。

Method: 拟合轻量级高斯后验，通过后验协方差白化，设计最小化后验期望失真的码本，使用贪心背包算法分配混合精度，支持标量量化器的闭式解和任务感知代理的蒙特卡洛方法。

Result: 在3.0/3.5/4.0比特权重下，BayesQ相比GPTQ在ResNet-50上提升+1.5/+0.7/+0.3个top-1百分点，在BERT-base上提升+1.1/+0.4/+0.2个GLUE分数。

Conclusion: BayesQ将后训练量化重新定义为实用的不确定性感知风险最小化流程，在保持预处理复杂度与GPTQ相当的同时显著提升低比特量化性能。

Abstract: We present BayesQ, an uncertainty-guided post-training quantization framework that is the first to optimize quantization under the posterior expected loss. BayesQ fits a lightweight Gaussian posterior over weights (diagonal Laplace by default; optional K-FAC/low-rank), whitens by the posterior covariance, designs codebooks to minimize posterior-expected distortion, and allocates mixed precision via a greedy knapsack that maximizes marginal expected-loss reduction per bit under a global budget. For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass. BayesQ reframes low-bit quantization as uncertainty-aware risk minimization in a practical, post-training pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂动态系统设计中，需要确保状态轨迹收敛到期望平衡点，但稳定性区域通常难以预先确定和计算。现有方法依赖系统控制方程的显式知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出LyapInf方法，假设Lyapunov函数为二次型形式，通过最小化Zubov方程的平均残差来拟合未知的二次算子，从而从轨迹数据中推断Lyapunov函数。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法成功表征了与推断Lyapunov函数相关的系统稳定性区域的近最大椭球体，无需系统控制方程知识。

Conclusion: LyapInf方法提供了一种有效的稳定性分析工具，能够从轨迹数据中推断Lyapunov函数并估计稳定性区域，适用于黑盒动态系统。

Abstract: In the design and operation of complex dynamical systems, it is essential to ensure that all state trajectories of the dynamical system converge to a desired equilibrium within a guaranteed stability region. Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.

Motivation: 现有MARL方法依赖静态或每步关系图，忽略了智能体在适应、移动或重组合作策略时自然产生的交互时间演化，而捕获这种演化依赖关系对于实现鲁棒和自适应协调至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过全面的消融研究揭示了结构和时间因素如何共同塑造MARL中的有效策略学习，证明了捕获时间演化依赖关系的重要性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose capturing and utilizing \textit{Temporal Information through Graph-based Embeddings and Representations} or \textbf{TIGER} to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

Motivation: 现有的差分隐私随机梯度下降方法通常只解决噪声或裁剪偏差中的一个问题，减少DP噪声会加剧裁剪偏差，反之亦然。需要一种能同时解决这两个问题的方法。

Method: DP-PMLF方法：1）使用逐样本动量在裁剪前平滑梯度估计，减少采样方差；2）采用后处理低通滤波器衰减高频DP噪声，不消耗额外隐私预算。

Result: 理论分析显示在严格DP保证下具有改进的收敛速率，实证评估表明DP-PMLF相比现有DPSGD变体显著提升了隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: DP-PMLF通过同时减轻DP噪声和裁剪偏差，有效改善了差分隐私深度学习模型的性能，提供了更好的隐私-效用权衡。

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) is widely used to train deep neural networks with formal privacy guarantees. However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.

Motivation: 拓扑描述符在关系数据中捕获多尺度结构信息日益重要，但图乘积上的拓扑描述符研究尚不充分，需要系统分析其表达能力和计算方法。

Method: 使用各种过滤方法在图乘积上构建拓扑描述符，包括基于颜色的过滤、顶点级和边级过滤，并开发了计算持续同调图的算法。

Result: 理论分析表明持续同调在图乘积中比单个图包含更多信息，而欧拉特征则不具备这种特性；实证研究验证了运行时间分析、表达能力和图分类性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过乘积过滤为强大的图持续描述符开辟了道路，证明了图乘积拓扑描述符在捕获结构信息方面的优势。

Abstract: Topological descriptors have been increasingly utilized for capturing multiscale structural information in relational data. In this work, we consider various filtrations on the (box) product of graphs and the effect on their outputs on the topological descriptors - the Euler characteristic (EC) and persistent homology (PH). In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance. Overall, this work paves way for powerful graph persistent descriptors via product filtrations. Code is available at https://github.com/Aalto-QuML/tda_graph_product.

Method: Bi-SR框架使用二分图连接LR和HR节点，保持拓扑结构和置换不变性；DEFEND框架通过将HR边映射到对偶图节点来学习边表示，使用标准基于节点的GNN进行边推断。

Result: 在真实脑连接组数据集上，两种框架在七个拓扑度量上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的两种GNN无关框架有效解决了现有图超分辨率方法的局限性，在保持图结构的同时实现了更好的可扩展性和表达能力。

Abstract: Graph super-resolution, the task of inferring high-resolution (HR) graphs from low-resolution (LR) counterparts, is an underexplored yet crucial research direction that circumvents the need for costly data acquisition. This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs. We evaluate both frameworks on a real-world brain connectome dataset, where they achieve state-of-the-art performance across seven topological measures. To support generalization, we introduce twelve new simulated datasets that capture diverse topologies and LR-HR relationships. These enable comprehensive benchmarking of graph super-resolution methods.

Conclusion: 这是将随机参数分解扩展到现代模型的第一步，表明该方法可用于发现可解释的参数空间机制。

Abstract: Recent work in mechanistic interpretability has shown that decomposing models in parameter space may yield clean handles for analysis and intervention. Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to "real models" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like "golf" and "basketball". These results take the first step in the direction of extending SPD to modern models, and show that we can use the method to surface interpretable parameter-space mechanisms.

Abstract: Various complex water management decisions are made in snow-dominant watersheds with the knowledge of Snow-Water Equivalent (SWE) -- a key measure widely used to estimate the water content of a snowpack. However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches. Collectively, these findings have provided a platform for deployment and feedback by the water management community.

TL;DR: EEG-X是一个面向脑电图分析的设备无关、抗噪声基础模型，通过位置通道嵌入和噪声感知重建策略解决EEG数据变异性大和信噪比低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG分析中的两个关键挑战：(1)不同设备和配置导致的数据集变异性；(2)EEG信号信噪比低，脑信号常被伪迹和非脑源噪声淹没。

Method: 提出位置通道嵌入编码空间信息；采用噪声感知掩码重建策略；引入字典启发的卷积变换层；训练模型重建去噪信号而非原始噪声信号。

Result: 在多个下游EEG任务中优于现有方法，在电极布局不同的跨域设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: EEG-X为EEG分析提供了一个鲁棒的基础模型，能够有效处理设备差异和噪声问题，在跨域任务中展现出色性能。

Abstract: Foundation models for EEG analysis are still in their infancy, limited by two key challenges: (1) variability across datasets caused by differences in recording devices and configurations, and (2) the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of EEG, where brain signals are often buried under artifacts and non-brain sources. To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Transformer编码器和1D CNN聚合器的两阶段架构，系统性地研究了整合临床元数据和专家事件标注对睡眠分期准确性的提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动睡眠分期劳动密集且存在评分者间变异性，现有深度学习模型大多仅依赖原始PSG信号，忽略了人类专家使用的上下文线索。

Method: 使用两阶段架构：基于Transformer的每时段编码器结合1D CNN聚合器，整合受试者临床元数据（年龄、性别、BMI）和每时段专家事件标注（呼吸暂停、血氧下降、觉醒、周期性呼吸）。

Result: 在SHHS队列（n=8,357）上，上下文融合显著提高分期准确性：与仅使用PSG的基线相比（macro-F1 0.7745，micro-F1 0.8774），最终模型达到macro-F1 0.8031和micro-F1 0.9051，事件标注贡献最大增益。特征融合优于预测相同辅助标签的多任务替代方案。

Conclusion: 将临床有意义特征与学习表示结合可增强性能和可解释性，无需修改PSG导联或额外传感器，为实现上下文感知、专家对齐的睡眠分期系统提供了实用且可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Manual sleep staging from polysomnography (PSG) is labor-intensive and prone to inter-scorer variability. While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors. Our findings support a practical and scalable path toward context-aware, expert-aligned sleep staging systems.

Conclusion: CSTs提供了一种无需训练但表达能力强的协方差分析方法，在低样本情况下比PCA更稳定，性能与需要训练的更复杂模型相当。

Abstract: Machine learning and data processing techniques relying on covariance information are widespread as they identify meaningful patterns in unsupervised and unlabeled settings. As a prominent example, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projects data points onto the eigenvectors of their covariance matrix, capturing the directions of maximum variance. This mapping, however, falls short in two directions: it fails to capture information in low-variance directions, relevant when, e.g., the data contains high-variance noise; and it provides unstable results in low-sample regimes, especially when covariance eigenvalues are close. CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs), i.e., graph neural networks using the covariance matrix as a graph, show improved stability to estimation errors and learn more expressive functions in the covariance spectrum than PCA, but require training and operate in a labeled setup. To get the benefits of both worlds, we propose Covariance Scattering Transforms (CSTs), deep untrained networks that sequentially apply filters localized in the covariance spectrum to the input data and produce expressive hierarchical representations via nonlinearities. We define the filters as covariance wavelets that capture specific and detailed covariance spectral patterns. We improve CSTs' computational and memory efficiency via a pruning mechanism, and we prove that their error due to finite-sample covariance estimations is less sensitive to close covariance eigenvalues compared to PCA, improving their stability. Our experiments on age prediction from cortical thickness measurements on 4 datasets collecting patients with neurodegenerative diseases show that CSTs produce stable representations in low-data settings, as VNNs but without any training, and lead to comparable or better predictions w.r.t. more complex learning models.

Motivation: 解决时间序列预测模型选择的两难困境：全面验证多个模型计算成本高，但选择错误模型会导致性能不佳。

Method: 使用光谱可预测性指标Ω来系统性地分层模型家族性能，在四个不同领域进行控制实验，并在GIFT-Eval基准的51个模型和28个数据集上扩展分析。

Result: 发现当Ω高时，大型时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)系统性地优于轻量级任务训练基线，但当Ω下降时优势消失。计算Ω仅需每个数据集几秒钟。

Conclusion: Ω可预测地分层模型性能，提供了一个实用的初步筛选工具，既能降低验证成本，又凸显了需要开发在真正困难(低Ω)问题上表现出色的模型。

Abstract: Practitioners deploying time series forecasting models face a dilemma: exhaustively validating dozens of models is computationally prohibitive, yet choosing the wrong model risks poor performance. We show that spectral predictability~$Ω$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $Ω$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $Ω$ drops. Computing $Ω$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $Ω$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$Ω$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.

Abstract: Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease, and timely diagnosis significantly improves patient survival. However, existing automated diagnosis methods suffer from fairness issues across demographic groups, potentially exacerbating healthcare disparities. In this work we propose FAST-CAD, a theoretically grounded framework that combines domain-adversarial training (DAT) with group distributionally robust optimization (Group-DRO) for fair and accurate non-contact stroke diagnosis. Our approach is built on domain adaptation and minimax fairness theory and provides convergence guarantees and fairness bounds. We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior diagnostic performance while maintaining fairness across demographic groups, and our theoretical analysis supports the effectiveness of the unified DAT + Group-DRO framework. This work provides both practical advances and theoretical insights for fair medical AI systems.

Conclusion: Weaver通过克罗内克分解和价注意力机制，实现了高效且性能优异的交通网络时空预测，在计算复杂度和预测精度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting on transportation networks is a complex task that requires understanding how traffic nodes interact within a dynamic, evolving system dictated by traffic flow dynamics and social behavioral patterns. The importance of transportation networks and ITS for modern mobility and commerce necessitates forecasting models that are not only accurate but also interpretable, efficient, and robust under structural or temporal perturbations. Recent approaches, particularly Transformer-based architectures, have improved predictive performance but often at the cost of high computational overhead and diminished architectural interpretability. In this work, we introduce Weaver, a novel attention-based model that applies Kronecker product approximations (KPA) to decompose the PN X PN spatiotemporal attention of O(P^2N^2) complexity into local P X P temporal and N X N spatial attention maps. This Kronecker attention map enables our Parallel-Kronecker Matrix-Vector product (P2-KMV) for efficient spatiotemporal message passing with O(P^2N + N^2P) complexity. To capture real-world traffic dynamics, we address the importance of negative edges in modeling traffic behavior by introducing Valence Attention using the continuous Tanimoto coefficient (CTC), which provides properties conducive to precise latent graph generation and training stability. To fully utilize the model's learning capacity, we introduce the Traffic Phase Dictionary for self-conditioning. Evaluations on PEMS-BAY and METR-LA show that Weaver achieves competitive performance across model categories while training more efficiently.

Conclusion: DIVO通过价值条件优化有效平衡了离线强化学习中的保守性和探索性，在多个任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, value overestimation caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions significantly limits policy performance. Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for neural networks on tabular data is critical to a wide range of applications, yet it remains challenging due to large, non-convex search spaces and the cost of exhaustive tuning. We introduce the Quantum-Inspired Bilevel Optimizer for Neural Networks (QIBONN), a bilevel framework that encodes feature selection, architectural hyperparameters, and regularization in a unified qubit-based representation. By combining deterministic quantum-inspired rotations with stochastic qubit mutations guided by a global attractor, QIBONN balances exploration and exploitation under a fixed evaluation budget. We conduct systematic experiments under single-qubit bit-flip noise (0.1\%--1\%) emulated by an IBM-Q backend. Results on 13 real-world datasets indicate that QIBONN is competitive with established methods, including classical tree-based methods and both classical/quantum-inspired HPO algorithms under the same tuning budget.

Conclusion: 该方法通过准确重建TAC值，有效解决了现有防御方法识别后门神经元精度低的问题，在各种场景下都优于现有防御方法。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a critical threat to machine learning models, causing them to behave normally on clean data but misclassify poisoned data into a poisoned class. Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.

Motivation: 传统变分自编码器和生成对抗网络已被扩散模型超越，但改进传统模型的研究停滞不前。本文旨在探索条件变分自编码器在图像生成中的应用，解决VAE生成图像模糊和多样性不足的问题。

Method: 1. 将高斯解码器的方差作为可学习参数进行训练；2. 使用归一化流估计潜在空间在给定标签下的条件分布，而不是假设其等于先验分布；3. 构建改进的条件变分自编码器框架。

Result: 与现有方法相比，该方法将FID（Fréchet Inception Distance）降低了5%，对数似然提高了7.7%，表明图像生成质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过将解码器方差参数化和使用归一化流准确建模条件分布，条件变分自编码器能够生成质量更高的图像，为传统生成模型的改进提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks remained the state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models until 2022. Now they are superseded by diffusion based models. Efforts to improve traditional models have stagnated as a result. In old-school fashion, we explore image generation with conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to incorporate desired attributes within the images. VAEs are known to produce blurry images with less diversity, we refer a method that solve this issue by leveraging the variance of the gaussian decoder as a learnable parameter during training. Previous works on CVAEs assumed that the conditional distribution of the latent space given the labels is equal to the prior distribution, which is not the case in reality. We show that estimating it using normalizing flows results in better image generation than existing methods by reducing the FID by 5% and increasing log likelihood by 7.7% than the previous case.

Result: 在常识推理基准测试中，使用Qwen1.5-MoE和DeepSeek-MoE的实验表明，Bayesian-MoE在预期校准误差（ECE）和负对数似然（NLL）方面均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Bayesian-MoE为可靠的下游决策提供了有效的后验不确定性估计框架，证实了其在提高模型校准性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: We present Bayesian Mixture of Experts (Bayesian-MoE), a post-hoc uncertainty estimation framework for fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts architectures. Our method applies a structured Laplace approximation to the second linear layer of each expert, enabling calibrated uncertainty estimation without modifying the original training procedure or introducing new parameters. Unlike prior approaches, which apply Bayesian inference to added adapter modules, Bayesian-MoE directly targets the expert pathways already present in MoE models, leveraging their modular design for tractable block-wise posterior estimation. We use Kronecker-factored low-rank approximations to model curvature and derive scalable estimates of predictive uncertainty and marginal likelihood. Experiments on common-sense reasoning benchmarks with Qwen1.5-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE demonstrate that Bayesian-MoE improves both expected calibration error (ECE) and negative log-likelihood (NLL) over baselines, confirming its effectiveness for reliable downstream decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SMoE模型依赖辅助损失和额外参数来促进专家多样性，导致目标不一致和模型复杂度增加。Sinkhorn方法存在显著训练开销问题。

Method: 将token-to-expert分配建模为最优传输问题，直接从传输映射推导门控分数，提出轻量级Sinkhorn路由机制SSR。

Result: 在语言建模和图像分类任务中，SSR实现了更快的训练速度、更高的准确率以及对输入损坏更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SSR通过最优传输路由有效平衡专家利用，无需辅助损失，在多个任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has gained prominence as a scalable and computationally efficient architecture, enabling significant growth in model capacity without incurring additional inference costs. However, existing SMoE models often rely on auxiliary losses (e.g., z-loss, load balancing) and additional trainable parameters (e.g., noisy gating) to encourage expert diversity, leading to objective misalignment and increased model complexity. Moreover, existing Sinkhorn-based methods suffer from significant training overhead due to their heavy reliance on the computationally expensive Sinkhorn algorithm. In this work, we formulate token-to-expert assignment as an optimal transport problem, incorporating constraints to ensure balanced expert utilization. We demonstrate that introducing a minimal degree of optimal transport-based routing enhances SMoE performance without requiring auxiliary balancing losses. Unlike previous methods, our approach derives gating scores directly from the transport map, enabling more effective token-to-expert balancing, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results. Building on these insights, we propose Selective Sinkhorn Routing (SSR), a routing mechanism that replaces auxiliary loss with lightweight Sinkhorn-based routing. SSR promotes balanced token assignments while preserving flexibility in expert selection. Across both language modeling and image classification tasks, SSR achieves faster training, higher accuracy, and greater robustness to input corruption.

Motivation: 传统RCT成本高、耗时长，无法跟上AI模型快速迭代的速度，阻碍了医疗AI工具的及时验证和临床应用。

Method: BRIDGE试验设计复用已完成试验中传统模型和更新模型预测一致的参与者数据，通过实际检查清单评估数据重用的有效性，并在乳腺癌、心血管疾病和败血症等真实数据集上进行验证。

Result: 在真实数据集中，连续AI模型间存在高度一致性（高风险队列重叠达64.8%），模拟乳腺癌筛查研究显示该设计可减少46.6%的入组需求，节省超过280万美元，同时保持80%的统计功效。

Conclusion: BRIDGE设计将试验转变为适应性、模块化研究，使每次模型迭代都能生成I级证据，加速AI在常规医疗中的成本效益转化。

Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are indispensable for establishing the clinical value of medical artificial-intelligence (AI) tools, yet their high cost and long timelines hinder timely validation as new models emerge rapidly. Here, we propose BRIDGE, a data-reuse RCT design for AI-based risk models. AI risk models support a broad range of interventions, including screening, treatment selection, and clinical alerts. BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power. By transforming trials into adaptive, modular studies, our proposed design makes Level I evidence generation feasible for every model iteration, thereby accelerating cost-effective translation of AI into routine care.

Motivation: 解决标准内在方法在高维非欧几里得流形上聚类的计算挑战，传统方法计算成本高昂，需要开发更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用p-Fréchet映射F^p将流形数据嵌入到低维欧几里得空间，然后应用k-means等标准欧几里得聚类技术。在SPD(n)流形上进行了严格的数学分析。

Result: 数值实验显示性能显著提升：与内在流形方法相比，运行时间减少高达两个数量级，同时保持高聚类精度，在现有替代方法失效的场景下也能有效工作。

Conclusion: 该框架为高维非欧几里得流形上的数据聚类提供了一种高效准确的解决方案，克服了传统方法的计算瓶颈。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, efficient framework for clustering data on high-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifolds that overcomes the computational challenges associated with standard intrinsic methods. The key innovation is the use of the $p$-Fréchet map $F^p : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ -- defined on a generic metric space $\mathcal{M}$ -- which embeds the manifold data into a lower-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^\ell$ using a set of reference points $\{r_i\}_{i=1}^\ell$, $r_i \in \mathcal{M}$. Once embedded, we can efficiently and accurately apply standard Euclidean clustering techniques such as k-means. We rigorously analyze the mathematical properties of $F^p$ in the Euclidean space and the challenging manifold of $n \times n$ symmetric positive definite matrices $\mathit{SPD}(n)$. Extensive numerical experiments using synthetic and real $\mathit{SPD}(n)$ data demonstrate significant performance gains: our method reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared to intrinsic manifold-based approaches, all while maintaining high clustering accuracy, including scenarios where existing alternative methods struggle or fail.

Conclusion: FLAD为未来协作自动驾驶模型训练和知识共享开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive data fusion and reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving (AD). However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.

TL;DR: FedSDWC是一种联邦学习方法，通过整合不变和可变特征的因果推理来应对数据分布差异问题，显著提升了泛化能力和OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临数据分布差异（如协变量偏移和语义偏移）的挑战，这影响了其在真实部署中的可靠性。现有不变学习方法在准确捕捉不变特征和直接构建因果表示方面存在局限。

Method: FedSDWC通过建模不变特征和可变特征之间的弱因果影响来推断因果语义表示，整合了不变和可变特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验验证了FedSDWC在处理协变量和语义偏移方面的优越性能，在CIFAR-10上平均比次优基线FedICON高出3.04%，在CIFAR-100上高出8.11%。

Conclusion: FedSDWC有效克服了现有方法的局限性，显著增强了联邦学习的泛化能力和OOD数据检测能力，并首次建立了与客户端先验分布的理论关系。

Abstract: Amid growing demands for data privacy and advances in computational infrastructure, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm. Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts. For example, FedSDWC outperforms FedICON, the next best baseline, by an average of 3.04% on CIFAR-10 and 8.11% on CIFAR-100.

We also release SAVSD, a smartphone-captured dataset with gender annotations, designed to support fairness research in low-resource, real-world contexts. Together, these contributions position FairM2S as a state-of-the-art approach for equitable and scalable few-shot stress detection in mental health AI. We release our dataset and FairM2S publicly with this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代预训练语言模型的表示空间具有高度非线性几何结构，文本嵌入位于弯曲的语义流形上。传统的线性聚合会扭曲几何结构，导致语义漂移，使聚合表示偏离内在流形，损失语义保真度和表达能力。

Conclusion: 研究确立了在文本属性图学习中流形感知聚合的重要性，为图神经网络处理文本嵌入提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) on text--attributed graphs (TAGs) typically encode node texts using pretrained language models (PLMs) and propagate these embeddings through linear neighborhood aggregation. However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple text encoders show that GeoGNN substantially mitigates semantic drift and consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing the importance of manifold--aware aggregation in text--attributed graph learning.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在更广泛应用中实现可证明高效的交互式偏好获取的潜力。

Abstract: Interactive preference elicitation (IPE) aims to substantially reduce human effort while acquiring human preferences in wide personalization systems. Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification. In contrast, we explore an alternative perspective based on feedback augmentation, and introduce critical improvements to the model-free DB framework. Specifically, we introduce augmented confidence bounds to integrate augmented human feedback under generalized concentration properties, and analyze the multi-factored performance trade-off via regret analysis. Our prototype algorithm achieves competitive performance across several IPE benchmarks, including recommendation, multi-objective optimization, and response optimization for large language models, demonstrating the potential of our approach for provably efficient IPE in broader applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为在PINNs中保证任何积分量守恒提供了一个通用框架，前提是存在可处理的解。

Abstract: We propose a novel projection method that guarantees the conservation of integral quantities in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). While the soft constraint that PINNs use to enforce the structure of partial differential equations (PDEs) enables necessary flexibility during training, it also permits the discovered solution to violate physical laws. To address this, we introduce a projection method that guarantees the conservation of the linear and quadratic integrals, both separately and jointly. We derived the projection formulae by solving constrained non-linear optimization problems and found that our PINN modified with the projection, which we call PINN-Proj, reduced the error in the conservation of these quantities by three to four orders of magnitude compared to the soft constraint and marginally reduced the PDE solution error. We also found evidence that the projection improved convergence through improving the conditioning of the loss landscape. Our method holds promise as a general framework to guarantee the conservation of any integral quantity in a PINN if a tractable solution exists.

Conclusion: 该方法通过可学习的类别关系显著增强了聚类算法的拟合能力，并能无缝扩展到包含数值和分类属性的混合数据集。

Abstract: Categorical attributes with qualitative values are ubiquitous in cluster analysis of real datasets. Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.

Conclusion: HCL在实际弱监督场景中有效验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their powerful content generation capabilities, have been successfully applied to data annotation processes. However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效减少LU分解中的填充元素，提高计算效率，在稀疏矩阵重排序任务上表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Fill-ins are new nonzero elements in the summation of the upper and lower triangular factors generated during LU factorization. For large sparse matrices, they will increase the memory usage and computational time, and be reduced through proper row or column arrangement, namely matrix reordering. Finding a row or column permutation with the minimal fill-ins is NP-hard, and surrogate objectives are designed to derive fill-in reduction permutations or learn a reordering function. However, there is no theoretical guarantee between the golden criterion and these surrogate objectives. Here we propose to learn a reordering network by minimizing \(l_1\) norm of triangular factors of the reordered matrix to approximate the exact number of fill-ins. The reordering network utilizes a graph encoder to predict row or column node scores. For inference, it is easy and fast to derive the permutation from sorting algorithms for matrices. For gradient based optimization, there is a large gap between the predicted node scores and resultant triangular factors in the optimization objective. To bridge the gap, we first design two reparameterization techniques to obtain the permutation matrix from node scores. The matrix is reordered by multiplying the permutation matrix. Then we introduce the factorization process into the objective function to arrive at target triangular factors. The overall objective function is optimized with the alternating direction method of multipliers and proximal gradient descent. Experimental results on benchmark sparse matrix collection SuiteSparse show the fill-in number and LU factorization time reduction of our proposed method is 20% and 17.8% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法如LocalNewton、LTDA和FedSophia在客户端进行迭代局部更新并在服务器上进行简单参数混合，但在异构数据设置下容易出现局部预条件器漂移问题，严重影响参数训练的收敛性。

Conclusion: FedPM通过预条件混合机制有效解决了局部预条件器漂移问题，充分发挥了二阶优化在联邦学习中的潜力，在异构数据环境下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose Federated Preconditioned Mixing (FedPM), a novel Federated Learning (FL) method that leverages second-order optimization. Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.
  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments. The results showed significant improvements with FedPM in the test accuracy compared to conventional methods incorporating simple mixing, fully leveraging the potential of second-order optimization.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RLHF/DPO流程的基本脆弱性，并提供了评估其对抗低成本投毒攻击鲁棒性的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems, making it critical to understand their vulnerabilities. While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning for autonomous cyber defence have resulted in agents that can successfully defend simulated computer networks against cyber-attacks. However, many of these agents would need retraining to defend networks with differing topology or size, making them poorly suited to real-world networks where topology and size can vary over time. In this research we introduce a novel set of Topological Extensions for Reinforcement Learning Agents (TERLA) that provide generalisability for the defence of networks with differing topology and size, without the need for retraining. Our approach involves the use of heterogeneous graph neural network layers to produce a fixed-size latent embedding representing the observed network state. This representation learning stage is coupled with a reduced, fixed-size, semantically meaningful and interpretable action space. We apply TERLA to a standard deep reinforcement learning Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) agent model, and to reduce the sim-to-real gap, conduct our research using Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 4. This Cyber Operations Research Gym environment has many of the features of a real-world network, such as realistic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) events and multiple agents defending network segments of differing topology and size. TERLA agents retain the defensive performance of vanilla PPO agents whilst showing improved action efficiency. Generalisability has been demonstrated by showing that all TERLA agents have the same network-agnostic neural network architecture, and by deploying a single TERLA agent multiple times to defend network segments with differing topology and size, showing improved defensive performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Class imbalance has been extensively studied in single-view scenarios; however, addressing this challenge in multi-view contexts remains an open problem, with even scarcer research focusing on trustworthy solutions. In this paper, we tackle a particularly challenging class imbalance problem in multi-view scenarios: long-tailed classification. We propose TMLC, a Trusted Multi-view Long-tailed Classification framework, which makes contributions on two critical aspects: opinion aggregation and pseudo-data generation. Specifically, inspired by Social Identity Theory, we design a group consensus opinion aggregation mechanism that guides decision making toward the direction favored by the majority of the group. In terms of pseudo-data generation, we introduce a novel distance metric to adapt SMOTE for multi-view scenarios and develop an uncertainty-guided data generation module that produces high-quality pseudo-data, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of class imbalance. Extensive experiments on long-tailed multi-view datasets demonstrate that our model is capable of achieving superior performance. The code is released at https://github.com/cncq-tang/TMLC.

Conclusion: 提出的链式框架能够有效估计高斯过程回归的全局和局部不确定性边界，在常用核函数上提供更紧的边界估计，且不依赖特定输入位置。

Abstract: Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a popular nonparametric Bayesian method that provides predictive uncertainty estimates and is widely used in safety-critical applications. While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Matérn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling. Our experimental results validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: Interlat提出了一种基于LLM隐藏状态（潜在空间）的智能体间通信范式，替代传统的自然语言通信，以克服信息压缩损失，提升协作问题解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言作为LLM智能体通信媒介存在根本限制，将丰富的内部潜在状态降采样为离散标记会限制信息传输的深度和细微差别，从而阻碍协作问题解决。

Method: 利用LLM的最后一个隐藏状态作为思维表示进行直接传输（潜在通信），并通过额外的压缩过程在潜在空间中进行完全潜在空间推理来进一步压缩潜在通信。

Result: 实验表明Interlat优于微调的思维链提示和单智能体基线，促进了更多探索性行为，并实现了对潜在信息的真正利用。进一步压缩不仅显著加速推理，还通过高效的信息保留机制保持了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作是对完全潜在空间智能体间通信的可行性研究，结果突显了其潜力，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: While natural language is the de facto communication medium for LLM-based agents, it presents a fundamental constraint. The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism. We position this work as a feasibility study of entirely latent space inter-agent communication, and our results highlight its potential, offering valuable insights for future research.

TL;DR: GroupFS是一个端到端的无监督特征选择框架，能够联合发现潜在特征组并从中选择最具信息量的组，无需依赖预定义分组或标签监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督特征选择方法通常独立评估特征，但信息信号往往来自相关特征组。虽然有些方法尝试捕捉组结构，但通常依赖预定义分区或标签监督，限制了适用性。

Method: GroupFS通过强制特征图和样本图上的拉普拉斯平滑性，并应用组稀疏正则化器来学习紧凑的结构化表示，联合发现特征组并选择信息量最大的组。

Result: 在涵盖图像、表格数据和生物数据集的九个基准测试中，GroupFS在聚类任务上始终优于最先进的无监督特征选择方法，并选择了与有意义模式对齐的特征组。

Conclusion: GroupFS能够有效发现和选择有意义的特征组，在无监督特征选择任务中表现出色，为高维学习任务提供了更好的特征降维解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised feature selection (FS) is essential for high-dimensional learning tasks where labels are not available. It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation. Across nine benchmarks spanning images, tabular data, and biological datasets, GroupFS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised FS in clustering and selects groups of features that align with meaningful patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前持续学习方法仍无法达到批训练的性能，需要构建紧凑记忆来避免灾难性遗忘，但即使是浅层神经网络也没有明确的解决方案。

Method: 基于Khan和Swaroop[2021]关于最优记忆存在性的结果，将最优记忆搜索问题转化为Hessian匹配问题，并提出概率PCA方法来估计最优记忆。

Result: 在Split-ImageNet上，仅用0.3%数据大小的记忆就达到60%准确率（经验回放为30%），用2%记忆达到74%准确率，接近批处理的77.6%。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建紧凑记忆开辟了新方向，未来也有望用于深度持续学习。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, continual learning still does not match the performance of batch training. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we need to build compact memory of essential past knowledge, but no clear solution has yet emerged, even for shallow neural networks with just one or two layers. In this paper, we present a new method to build compact memory for logistic regression. Our method is based on a result by Khan and Swaroop [2021] who show the existence of optimal memory for such models. We formulate the search for the optimal memory as Hessian-matching and propose a probabilistic PCA method to estimate them. Our approach can drastically improve accuracy compared to Experience Replay. For instance, on Split-ImageNet, we get 60% accuracy compared to 30% obtained by replay with memory-size equivalent to 0.3% of the data size. Increasing the memory size to 2% further boosts the accuracy to 74%, closing the gap to the batch accuracy of 77.6% on this task. Our work opens a new direction for building compact memory that can also be useful in the future for continual deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决决策变换器在跨域迁移中存在的轨迹片段缝合性问题，包括状态结构错位、RTG不可比性和动作跳跃等问题。

Method: 提出DFDT框架：使用MMD和OT两级数据过滤选择源轨迹片段，用优势条件化令牌替代RTG令牌，并应用Q引导正则化器抑制连接点跳跃。

Result: 在D4RL风格控制任务的重力、运动学和形态学迁移中，DFDT相比强基线方法在回报和稳定性方面均有提升。

Conclusion: DFDT通过数据融合和语义连续性改进，有效解决了跨域决策变换器的缝合性问题，理论分析表明该方法能缩小性能差距。

Abstract: Cross-domain shifts present a significant challenge for decision transformer (DT) policies. Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.

### [156] [FSampler: Training Free Acceleration of Diffusion Sampling via Epsilon Extrapolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09180)
*Michael A. Vladimir*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSampler是一个无需训练、与采样器无关的执行层，通过减少函数评估次数来加速扩散采样。它使用历史去噪信号预测下一个epsilon，在特定步骤替代模型调用，可减少15-50%的模型调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型采样过程需要大量函数评估，计算成本高昂。FSampler旨在在不改变采样器公式的情况下，通过预测机制减少模型调用次数，从而加速采样过程。

Method: FSampler维护最近模型调用的去噪信号历史，使用二阶、三阶或四阶有限差分预测器外推下一个epsilon。在选定步骤用预测的epsilon替代模型调用，包含学习稳定器、梯度估计稳定器、保护窗口和周期性锚点等机制来确保稳定性。

Result: 在FLUX.1 dev、Qwen Image和Wan 2.2等模型上，FSampler减少时间8-22%，减少模型调用15-25%，同时保持高保真度（SSIM 0.95-0.99）。在激进模式下可减少45-50%的模型调用，但保真度较低（SSIM 0.73-0.74）。

Conclusion: FSampler提供了一种有效的扩散采样加速方法，与多种采样器兼容，在不显著影响生成质量的情况下显著减少计算开销。

Abstract: FSampler is a training free, sampler agnostic execution layer that accelerates diffusion sampling by reducing the number of function evaluations (NFE). FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas. With an aggressive adaptive gate, reductions can reach 45 to 50% fewer model calls at lower fidelity (SSIM 0.73 to 0.74).

Conclusion: IPBT能够自动调整关键元超参数，在各种任务中实现稳定优越的性能，为超参数优化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) can lift the burden of tuning hyperparameters (HPs) of neural networks. HPO algorithms from the Population Based Training (PBT) family are efficient thanks to dynamically adjusting HPs every few steps of the weight optimization. Recent results indicate that the number of steps between HP updates is an important meta-HP of all PBT variants that can substantially affect their performance. Yet, no method or intuition is available for efficiently setting its value. We introduce Iterated Population Based Training (IPBT), a novel PBT variant that automatically adjusts this HP via restarts that reuse weight information in a task-agnostic way and leverage time-varying Bayesian optimization to reinitialize HPs. Evaluation on 8 image classification and reinforcement learning tasks shows that, on average, our algorithm matches or outperforms 5 previous PBT variants and other HPO algorithms (random search, ASHA, SMAC3), without requiring a budget increase or any changes to its HPs.

Conclusion: 数据清洗是提高AI文本检测器鲁棒性的有效方法，重新处理后的数据集已公开可用，有助于提升检测器的训练和评估质量。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for many applications. To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as "Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult. The reprocessed dataset is publicly available.

Motivation: 现有方法在MILP问题求解中存在两个层面的不对齐：学习目标层面，二元交叉熵损失独立处理变量，忽略了相对优先级；模型架构层面，标准GNN消息传递平滑了变量表示，忽略了约束内的竞争关系。

Method: 提出CoCo-MILP方法：在学习目标层面引入变量间对比损失，最大化赋值为1和0的变量之间的嵌入边界；在架构层面设计约束内竞争GNN层，学习区分约束内竞争变量的表示。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模变量间的对比和约束内的竞争关系，CoCo-MILP能够更好地捕捉MILP问题的内在结构，实现更高质量的求解预测。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet solving large-scale instances remains a significant computational challenge. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in unsupervised learning, but most existing methods heavily rely on hyperparameters such as the number of clusters or other sensitive settings, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing clustering approaches designed for scenarios with an unknown number of clusters.

Conclusion: 推理时FK控制将基于扩散的蛋白质设计推广到任意、不可微分和奖励不可知的目标，为引导分子生成提供统一框架

Abstract: Diffusion-based models have recently enabled the generation of realistic and diverse protein structures, yet they remain limited in their ability to steer outcomes toward specific functional or biochemical objectives, such as binding affinity or sequence composition. Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) lies at the core of many real-world combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, traditionally solved by branch-and-bound (B&B). A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies. Computational experiments empirically validate our approach, with our MBRL branching agent outperforming previous state-of-the-art RL methods across four standard MILP benchmarks.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in tackling combinatorial optimization problems. However, existing methods still suffer from limited accuracy when addressing that on complex graphs and exhibit poor scalability, since full training requires loading the whole adjacent matrix and all embeddings at a time, the it may results in out of memory of a single machine. This limitation significantly restricts their applicability to large-scale scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed GNN-based training framework for combinatorial optimization. In details, firstly, large graph is partition into several small subgraphs. Then the individual subgraphs are full trained, providing a foundation for efficient local optimization. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) are employed to take actions according to GNN output, to make sure the restrictions between cross nodes can be learned. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real large-scale social network datasets (e.g., Facebook, Youtube) and synthetically generated high-complexity graphs, which demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both solution quality and computational efficiency. Moreover, the experiments on large graph instances also validate the scalability of the model.

Motivation: 预测编码框架中形成反映环境潜在结构的低维内部表征的条件尚不清楚，需要研究预测时间范围和网络深度如何影响这些表征的形成。

Method: 使用受先前工作启发的抽象设置，通过理论和实证分析，研究网络深度和预测时间范围对预测编码任务解决方案的影响，并扩展到非线性网络和复杂数据集。

Result: 足够深的网络在多步预测时间范围训练下能一致恢复底层潜在结构，这一现象可通过普通最小二乘估计器结构和学习动态中的偏差来解释。

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了对预测编码何时以及为何诱导结构化表征的原则性理解，弥合了经验观察与理论基础之间的差距。

Abstract: Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但仍容易受到同时破坏模型效用和公平性的攻击，现有研究主要关注单一目标的攻击，缺乏对双重攻击的研究。

Method: 提出了两种DFA变体(S-DFA和Sp-DFA)，并开发了GuardFed防御框架，通过维护公平感知参考模型和计算双重信任评分来选择性聚合客户端更新。

Result: 实验表明现有防御方法无法有效抵抗DFA攻击，而GuardFed在各种非IID和对抗条件下都能保持准确性和公平性，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DFA攻击对联邦学习构成严重威胁，GuardFed提供了一种有效的防御解决方案，能够同时保护模型效用和公平性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training but remains vulnerable to adversarial behaviors that compromise model utility or fairness across sensitive groups. While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GuardFed consistently preserves both accuracy and fairness under diverse non-IID and adversarial conditions, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared with existing robust FL methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络的黑盒特性阻碍了其广泛应用，现有可解释AI方法存在忠实性不足的问题，而现有的决策树转换方法缺乏精确性、可扩展性或可解释性。

Method: 提出了RENTT算法，能够将神经网络（包括CNN、RNN、非ReLU激活函数和偏置项）精确转换为等价的决策树表示，同时保持运行时和内存效率。

Result: RENTT算法在计算效率和可扩展性方面表现出色，能够揭示真实解释，优于传统的近似方法如LIME和SHAP。

Conclusion: RENTT提供了一种将神经网络精确转换为决策树的有效方法，能够计算全局、区域和局部层面的真实特征重要性，增强了神经网络的可解释性和可信度。

Abstract: Although neural networks are a powerful tool, their widespread use is hindered by the opacity of their decisions and their black-box nature, which result in a lack of trustworthiness. To alleviate this problem, methods in the field of explainable Artificial Intelligence try to unveil how such automated decisions are made. But explainable AI methods are often plagued by missing faithfulness/correctness, meaning that they sometimes provide explanations that do not align with the neural network's decision and logic. Recently, transformations to decision trees have been proposed to overcome such problems. Unfortunately, they typically lack exactness, scalability, or interpretability as the size of the neural network grows. Thus, we generalize these previous results, especially by considering convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, non-ReLU activation functions, and bias terms. Our findings are accompanied by rigorous proofs and we present a novel algorithm RENTT (Runtime Efficient Network to Tree Transformation) designed to compute an exact equivalent decision tree representation of neural networks in a manner that is both runtime and memory efficient. The resulting decision trees are multivariate and thus, possibly too complex to understand. To alleviate this problem, we also provide a method to calculate the ground truth feature importance for neural networks via the equivalent decision trees - for entire models (global), specific input regions (regional), or single decisions (local). All theoretical results are supported by detailed numerical experiments that emphasize two key aspects: the computational efficiency and scalability of our algorithm, and that only RENTT succeeds in uncovering ground truth explanations compared to conventional approximation methods like LIME and SHAP. All code is available at https://github.com/HelenaM23/RENTT .

Motivation: 传统方法在降低神经网络复杂度的同时难以保持泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是全连接层在这些方面不如量子计算中的电路模型。

Method: TCNN结合张量神经网络和残差电路模型，在复数域中使用激活操作和并行电路架构提高非线性特征学习效率，并引入信息融合层合并实部和虚部参数中的特征信息。

Conclusion: TCNN通过激活操作、并行架构和信息融合层的协同作用，在保持低复杂度的同时实现了优异的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: It is challenging to reduce the complexity of neural networks while maintaining their generalization ability and robustness, especially for practical applications. Conventional solutions for this problem incorporate quantum-inspired neural networks with Kronecker products and hybrid tensor neural networks with MPO factorization and fully-connected layers. Nonetheless, the generalization power and robustness of the fully-connected layers are not as outstanding as circuit models in quantum computing. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor circuit neural network (TCNN) that takes advantage of the characteristics of tensor neural networks and residual circuit models to achieve generalization ability and robustness with low complexity. The proposed activation operation and parallelism of the circuit in complex number field improves its non-linearity and efficiency for feature learning. Moreover, since the feature information exists in the parameters in both the real and imaginary parts in TCNN, an information fusion layer is proposed for merging features stored in those parameters to enhance the generalization capability. Experimental results confirm that TCNN showcases more outstanding generalization and robustness with its average accuracies on various datasets 2\%-3\% higher than those of the state-of-the-art compared models. More significantly, while other models fail to learn features under noise parameter attacking, TCNN still showcases prominent learning capability owing to its ability to prevent gradient explosion. Furthermore, it is comparable to the compared models on the number of trainable parameters and the CPU running time. An ablation study also indicates the advantage of the activation operation, the parallelism architecture and the information fusion layer.

Motivation: 复杂黑盒AI模型的普及增加了对其决策进行解释的需求，但特征归因方法领域一直缺乏正式的问题定义。

Method: 提出了DFAX（Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations）方法，这是一种新颖的模型无关特征归因方法，直接基于数据分布解释分类器预测。

Result: 通过广泛实验证明，DFAX比现有最先进的基线方法更有效和高效。

Conclusion: 许多现有模型无关方法不符合正式定义标准，而DFAX作为首个基于数据分布的特征归因方法，克服了这些限制。

Abstract: The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution. We show through extensive experiments that DFAX is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型缩放范式导致巨大的内存开销，特别是当实现FlashAttention后，前馈网络（FFN）的激活内存已成为关键瓶颈。

Method: 引入MoC架构，利用SwiGLU的原生门控机制为每个token选择性激活Top-K最相关通道，并在推理时通过部分权重加载到GPU SRAM来减少内存访问。

Result: 实验验证MoC在预训练中显著减少激活内存，提高推理吞吐量，同时保持有竞争力的模型性能。

Conclusion: MoC是一种有效的FFN架构创新，能够解决大语言模型中激活内存瓶颈问题，在内存节省和效率提升方面表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across diverse artificial intelligence tasks, driven by scaling laws that correlate model size and training data with performance improvements. However, this scaling paradigm incurs substantial memory overhead, creating significant challenges for both training and inference. While existing research has primarily addressed parameter and optimizer state memory reduction, activation memory-particularly from feed-forward networks (FFNs)-has become the critical bottleneck, especially when FlashAttention is implemented. In this work, we conduct a detailed memory profiling of LLMs and identify FFN activations as the predominant source to activation memory overhead. Motivated by this, we introduce Mixture-of-Channels (MoC), a novel FFN architecture that selectively activates only the Top-K most relevant channels per token determined by SwiGLU's native gating mechanism. MoC substantially reduces activation memory during pre-training and improves inference efficiency by reducing memory access through partial weight loading into GPU SRAM. Extensive experiments validate that MoC delivers significant memory savings and throughput gains while maintaining competitive model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有配置文件污染攻击方法存在两个局限性：过度依赖序列水平影响限制了细粒度项目转换扰动，整体修改导致可检测的分布偏移

Method: 结合双层优化框架与多奖励强化学习，开发模式平衡奖励策略（整合模式反转奖励和分布一致性奖励），采用约束组相对强化学习范式进行逐步扰动

Result: 大量实验证明了CREAT的有效性

Conclusion: CREAT方法能够平衡对抗效果和隐蔽性，实现目标污染且检测性最小

Abstract: Sequential Recommenders, which exploit dynamic user intents through interaction sequences, is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CREAT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典RMAB假设固定动态，这在非平稳环境中常常不成立。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够适应潜在环境状态变化的模型和方法。

Method: 提出了MARBLE模型，在RMAB基础上加入潜在马尔可夫状态；引入了马尔可夫平均可索引性(MAI)准则；开发了同步Q学习与Whittle索引(QWI)算法。

Result: 在MAI准则下，QWI算法几乎必然收敛到最优Q函数和相应的Whittle索引；在推荐系统数字孪生模拟器上的验证表明QWI能够适应潜在状态变化并收敛到最优策略。

Conclusion: MARBLE模型和MAI准则为处理非平稳环境中的RMAB问题提供了有效框架，QWI算法在理论和实证上都表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are powerful models for decision-making under uncertainty, yet classical formulations typically assume fixed dynamics, an assumption often violated in nonstationary environments. We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices. We validate MARBLE on a calibrated simulator-embedded (digital twin) recommender system, where QWI consistently adapts to a shifting latent state and converges to an optimal policy, empirically corroborating our theoretical findings.

Motivation: 由于GDPR等隐私法规要求完全删除未经授权的数据，而现有方法主要针对静态图设计，无法有效处理时空图中节点信息在时空维度全局扩散的问题，需要一种高效的时空图遗忘方法。

Method: 提出CallosumNet框架，采用分治法：1) 增强子图构建(ESC) - 基于生物启发式虚拟神经节自适应构建多个局部子图；2) 全局神经节桥接(GGB) - 从局部子图重建全局时空依赖关系。

Conclusion: CallosumNet成功解决了时空图数据遗忘的挑战，提供了一种高效且完整的节点级遗忘解决方案，满足严格的隐私法规要求。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graphs are widely used in modeling complex dynamic processes such as traffic forecasting, molecular dynamics, and healthcare monitoring. Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.

Abstract: We propose a method that uses large language models to assist graph machine learning under personalization and privacy constraints. The approach combines data augmentation for sparse graphs, prompt and instruction tuning to adapt foundation models to graph tasks, and in-context learning to supply few-shot graph reasoning signals. These signals parameterize a Dynamic UMAP manifold of client-specific graph embeddings inside a Bayesian variational objective for personalized federated learning. The method supports node classification and link prediction in low-resource settings and aligns language model latent representations with graph structure via a cross-modal regularizer. We outline a convergence argument for the variational aggregation procedure, describe a differential privacy threat model based on a moments accountant, and present applications to knowledge graph completion, recommendation-style link prediction, and citation and product graphs. We also discuss evaluation considerations for benchmarking LLM-assisted graph machine learning.

Motivation: 现有的SHAP计算方法存在效率问题，特别是在处理大规模数据集时计算时间过长，需要一种更高效的算法来支持实际应用中的大规模计算需求。

Method: WOODELF为每个消费者构建伪布尔公式，捕捉特征值、决策树集成结构和整个背景数据集，然后利用这种表示在线性时间内计算背景SHAP值。

Result: 在包含300万行、500万背景样本和127个特征的数据集上，WOODELF在CPU上计算所有背景Shapley值仅需162秒，在GPU上仅需16秒，相比现有最佳方法分别实现了16倍和165倍的加速。

Conclusion: WOODELF提供了一种高效计算SHAP和其他博弈论值的统一框架，支持大规模实际应用，并通过标准Python库实现，便于集成到现有框架中。

Abstract: SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is a key tool for interpreting decision tree ensembles by assigning contribution values to features. It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.
  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.
  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.
  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE. The study concludes by identifying hybrid models as a promising future direction.

Motivation: 精确PET成像需要支持无约束探测器布局的方法，从步行通过设计到长轴环，其中间隙和开放侧会导致严重欠采样的sinogram数据

Method: 将缺失的响应线视为可学习的先验，探索使用条件扩散模型来插值稀疏采样的sinogram数据

Result: 为新型、成本效益高且患者友好的PET几何结构在真实临床环境中应用铺平道路

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法，特别是生成模型，为恢复缺失信息提供了有前景的途径

Abstract: Accurate PET imaging increasingly requires methods that support unconstrained detector layouts from walk-through designs to long-axial rings where gaps and open sides lead to severely undersampled sinograms. Instead of constraining the hardware to form complete cylinders, we propose treating the missing lines-of-responses as a learnable prior. Data-driven approaches, particularly generative models, offer a promising pathway to recover this missing information. In this work, we explore the use of conditional diffusion models to interpolate sparsely sampled sinograms, paving the way for novel, cost-efficient, and patient-friendly PET geometries in real clinical settings.

TL;DR: AdaCuRL是一个自适应课程强化学习框架，通过粗到细的难度估计和自适应课程调度来解决强化学习训练中的梯度饥饿和策略退化问题，在多个推理基准测试中显著提升LLMs和MLLMs的性能。

Conclusion: AdaCuRL通过自适应课程强化学习有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为增强大语言模型的推理能力提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that AdaCuRL consistently achieves significant performance improvements on both LLMs and MLLMs.

Conclusion: AGT为训练数据扰动的鲁棒性认证提供了一个统一的形式化框架，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: The impact of inference-time data perturbation (e.g., adversarial attacks) has been extensively studied in machine learning, leading to well-established certification techniques for adversarial robustness. In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PTE的免保留遗忘框架，通过探测-编辑过程实现选择性遗忘，仅需遗忘数据和原始模型即可完成高效知识编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态工业物联网环境中模型需要选择性遗忘过时或错误知识的问题，避免现有方法依赖保留数据带来的计算负担和隐私合规冲突。

Method: PTE框架包含两个阶段：首先通过梯度上升探测遗忘类别的决策边界邻域并生成编辑指令；然后进行推-拉协同优化，推分支主动拆解目标类决策区域，拉分支通过掩码知识蒸馏锚定保留类知识。

Result: 在CWRU和SCUT-FD等多个通用和工业基准测试中，PTE在遗忘效果和模型效用之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: PTE提供了一种高效且平衡的知识编辑方法，仅需遗忘数据和原始模型，适用于工业物联网环境中的动态知识管理需求。

Abstract: In dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments, models need the ability to selectively forget outdated or erroneous knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSGP使用预训练transformer模型作为变异算子，通过控制语义相似度生成子代程序，在符号回归问题上显著优于多种基准方法，并能通过目标语义距离SD_t有效平衡探索与利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义遗传编程依赖固定的语法变换，难以学习多样化的结构变化。TSGP旨在利用transformer模型学习能够产生相似语义的多样化程序结构变异。

Method: 使用预训练的transformer模型作为变异算子，通过控制目标语义距离SD_t来生成与父代语义相似的子代程序。模型在数百万程序上训练，能够泛化到不同维度的符号回归问题。

Result: 在24个真实世界和合成数据集上，TSGP显著优于标准GP、SLIM_GSGP、深度符号回归和去噪自编码器GP，平均排名1.58。同时比SLIM_GSGP产生更紧凑的解，且精度更高。

Conclusion: TSGP通过transformer模型实现了有效的语义搜索，SD_t参数能够控制语义空间的步长：小值实现持续改进但程序较大，大值促进快速收敛和紧凑性，为平衡探索与利用提供了有效机制。

Abstract: Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.

Abstract: Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.

Conclusion: 通过将群对称性融入稀疏自编码器，可以更有效地提取具有对称性的科学数据的可解释特征，提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven useful in disentangling the opaque activations of neural networks, primarily large language models, into sets of interpretable features. However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop adaptively equivariant SAEs that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools.

Result: 验证了该方法的有效性，并通过主要SEP事件的可解释性案例研究展示了该方法如何提高可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了模型透明度，促进了更基于物理的SEP事件预测理解。

Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events, as one of the most prominent manifestations of solar activity, can generate severe hazardous radiation when accelerated by solar flares or shock waves formed aside from coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.

Result: 在国际象棋中，SOLIS仅使用浅层搜索就能在约束条件下达到竞争性强度

Conclusion: 评估对齐的潜在规划为传统动态模型或策略学习提供了轻量级替代方案

Abstract: Planning in high-dimensional decision spaces is increasingly being studied through the lens of learned representations. Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions. More broadly, our results suggest that evaluation-aligned latent planning offers a lightweight alternative to traditional dynamics models or policy learning.

Conclusion: 基于概率密度感知的核心集选择方法能够有效提升持续学习的性能，同时保持较高的计算效率，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Rehearsal-based Continual Learning (CL) maintains a limited memory buffer to store replay samples for knowledge retention, making these approaches heavily reliant on the quality of the stored samples. Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios. Extensive comparative experiments show that our methods outperforms other baselines across various CL settings while ensuring favorable efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调需要高质量数据集，但人工标注成本高昂。现有自动化方法需要标注数据进行奖励建模，这在没有客观真实值的主观任务中尤其困难。

Method: 将问题重构为蒙特卡洛树搜索，使用无数据集混合奖励指导搜索。奖励包含两个LLM作为评判者组件：一个评估样本质量，另一个评估工作流代码和提示质量。

Result: 在主观教育任务实验中，AutoSynth生成的数据训练的模型显著优于基线（40-51% vs 2-5%），在某些指标上匹配或超越专家设计的工作流，同时将人工工作量从5-7小时减少到30分钟。

Conclusion: AutoSynth解决了数据中心AI中的冷启动问题，为主观LLM任务提供了可扩展、经济高效的方法。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks requires high-quality datasets, but manual curation is prohibitively expensive. Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks. Code: https://github.com/bisz9918-maker/AutoSynth.

Conclusion: 提出的二阶框架能够有效利用曲率信息，适用于任何可微策略类，在收敛速度和性能方面优于一阶方法

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a second-order deterministic actor-critic framework in reinforcement learning that extends the classical deterministic policy gradient method to exploit curvature information of the performance function. Building on the concept of compatible function approximation for the critic, we introduce a quadratic critic that simultaneously preserves the true policy gradient and an approximation of the performance Hessian. A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently. This construction enables a quasi-Newton actor update using information learned by the critic, yielding faster convergence compared to first-order methods. The proposed approach is general and applicable to any differentiable policy class. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method achieves improved convergence and performance over standard deterministic actor-critic baselines.

Conclusion: GenePheno是首个直接从基因序列预测敲除诱导表型异常的可解释多标签预测框架，为可扩展的假设驱动实验提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Exploring how genetic sequences shape phenotypes is a fundamental challenge in biology and a key step toward scalable, hypothesis-driven experimentation. The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.

Abstract: Machine learning fits model parameters to approximate input-output mappings, predicting unknown samples. However, these models often require extensive arithmetic computations during inference, increasing latency and power consumption. This paper proposes a digital-time-domain computing approach for Tsetlin machine (TM) inference process to address these challenges. This approach leverages a delay accumulation mechanism to mitigate the costly arithmetic sums of classes and employs a Winner-Takes-All scheme to replace conventional magnitude comparators. Specifically, a Hamming distance-driven time-domain scheme is implemented for multi-class TMs. Furthermore, differential delay paths, combined with a leading-ones-detector logarithmic delay compression digital-time-domain scheme, are utilised for the coalesced TMs, accommodating both binary-signed and exponential-scale delay accumulation issues. Compared to the functionally equivalent, post-implementation digital TM architecture baseline, the proposed architecture demonstrates orders-of-magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and throughput.

Abstract: Designing ligands that are both chemically valid and structurally compatible with protein binding pockets is a key bottleneck in computational drug discovery. Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery.

Motivation: 在有限平行数据的情况下，提高机器翻译模型的性能和数据效率，特别是在标注平行语料库稀缺的环境中。

Method: 通过生成违反目标语言语法的合成示例来扩充有限的平行数据，并在损失函数中明确惩罚模型对这些语言无效输出赋予高概率的行为。

Result: 在所有架构上都实现了改进：性能良好的模型获得3-12%的BLEU增益，缺乏足够初始支持的模型获得56-89%的增益；提供5倍的数据效率倍增器，使用1,000个示例的训练效果达到或超过正常使用5,000个示例的训练。

Conclusion: NSL-MT为标注平行语料库有限的环境提供了一种数据高效的替代训练方法。

Abstract: We introduce Negative Space Learning MT (NSL-MT), a training method that teaches models what not to generate by encoding linguistic constraints as severity-weighted penalties in the loss function. NSL-MT increases limited parallel data with synthetically generated violations of target language grammar, explicitly penalizing the model when it assigns high probability to these linguistically invalid outputs. We demonstrate that NSL-MT delivers improvements across all architectures: 3-12\% BLEU gains for well-performing models and 56-89\% gains for models lacking descent initial support. Furthermore, NSL-MT provides a 5x data efficiency multiplier -- training with 1,000 examples matches or exceeds normal training with 5,000 examples. Thus, NSL-MT provides a data-efficient alternative training method for settings where there is limited annotated parallel corporas.
