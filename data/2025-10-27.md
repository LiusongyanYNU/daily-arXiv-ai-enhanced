### [1] [Preventing Shortcuts in Adapter Training via Providing the Shortcuts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20887)
*Anujraaj Argo Goyal,Guocheng Gordon Qian,Huseyin Coskun,Aarush Gupta,Himmy Tam,Daniil Ostashev,Ju Hu,Dhritiman Sagar,Sergey Tulyakov,Kfir Aberman,Kuan-Chieh Jackson Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，通过在适配器训练中为混淆因素建立捷径，防止目标属性与偶然因素的纠缠，提升生成质量和文本提示遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配器训练方法容易将目标属性（如身份）与偶然因素（如姿势、表情、光照）纠缠在一起，限制了泛化能力和文本提示的遵循性。

Method: 在适配器训练期间，通过ControlNet或LoRA等辅助模块为混淆因素建立捷径，消除适配器内部化这些因素的动力，推理时移除辅助模块。

Result: 应用于面部和全身身份注入任务时，该方法提高了生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，寻求解耦表示的最有效路径可能是为不应学习的内容建立捷径。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 是一种新的视频生成范式，通过参考视频作为语义提示来引导冻结的视频扩散变换器，实现了统一、可泛化的语义控制，在开源方法中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中统一、可泛化语义控制的关键挑战，现有方法要么引入伪影，要么依赖不可泛化的条件特定微调或任务特定架构。

Method: 引入VAP范式，将参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过即插即用的混合变换器专家引导冻结的视频扩散变换器，采用时间偏置位置嵌入消除虚假映射先验。

Result: 作为单一统一模型，VAP在开源方法中达到新SOTA，获得38.7%的用户偏好率，可与领先的条件特定商业模型相媲美，并具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: VAP在统一可控视频生成方面取得显著进展，支持各种下游应用，推动通用可控视频生成的发展。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [3] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FM-BFF-Net网络，结合CNN和Transformer，使用焦点调制注意力机制和双向特征融合模块，在医学图像分割中提升边界精度和对病变变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对临床诊断和治疗至关重要，但传统CNN难以捕捉全局上下文信息和长程依赖关系，限制了复杂边界和不同大小结构的精确分割能力。

Method: 结合卷积和Transformer组件，采用焦点调制注意力机制增强上下文感知，引入双向特征融合模块实现编码器和解码器跨尺度的有效交互。

Result: 在8个公开数据集上的实验表明，FM-BFF-Net在Jaccard指数和Dice系数上持续超越现有最先进方法，证实了其有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net通过融合CNN和Transformer的优势，有效解决了医学图像分割中的全局上下文捕捉和边界精度问题，在多种医学成像场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [4] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenPT是一个生成式点跟踪框架，通过流匹配建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡点跟踪上达到最先进精度，同时保持可见点的竞争性跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有判别式模型在存在视觉遮挡等不确定性时只能回归到均值或众数，无法捕捉轨迹的多模态特性。

Method: 采用流匹配公式，结合判别式跟踪器的迭代优化、跨窗口一致性的窗口相关先验，以及针对点坐标调整的方差调度。推理时使用最佳优先搜索策略。

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现优异，特别是在遮挡点跟踪方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: GenPT能够有效捕捉点轨迹的多模态特性，在遮挡点跟踪上显著优于现有方法，同时保持可见点跟踪的竞争力。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [5] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了3DReasonKnee数据集，这是首个用于医学图像的3D基础推理数据集，包含从7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积中提取的494k高质量五元组，支持解剖区域的3D定位和逐步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中难以对解剖区域进行定位和逐步推理，而这正是真实世界诊断评估的关键要求。需要使模型输出与临床医生的诊断工作流程保持一致，实现可信的临床医生-AI协作。

Method: 创建了3DReasonKnee数据集，每个五元组包括：3D MRI体积、针对特定解剖区域的诊断问题、定位相关解剖结构的3D边界框、临床医生生成的明确详细3D推理过程的诊断推理步骤，以及相关解剖区域的结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估框架，评估了五个最先进的视觉语言模型在定位和诊断准确性方面的表现，为ReasonKnee-Bench提供了基准性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的存储库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐、局部化决策能力发展提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

### [6] [Thermal Polarimetric Multi-view Stereo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20972)
*Takahiro Kushida,Kenichiro Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用热偏振线索进行详细3D形状重建的新方法，该方法不依赖光照和材料特性，通过长波红外偏振成像解决可见光偏振分析的模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D重建方法通常依赖光照和材料特性，这限制了在透明、半透明和异质物体上的应用。热偏振成像可以避免这些限制，提供更可靠的形状重建。

Method: 建立了偏振观测的一般理论，利用长波红外偏振成像消除模糊性，提出基于多视角热偏振图像的3D形状恢复方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效重建透明、半透明和异质物体的精细细节，性能优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 热偏振成像为3D形状重建提供了一种独立于光照和材料特性的有效方法，特别适用于传统方法难以处理的物体类型。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [7] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VESSA是一种基于视频的无监督自适应方法，通过多视角物体中心视频对视觉基础模型进行自监督微调，无需标注即可适应新领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在分布偏移和标注稀缺的领域表现不佳，而传统的自监督学习策略对视觉编码器模型效果有限。

Method: 采用自蒸馏范式，利用多视角物体中心视频进行训练，精心调整预测头并部署参数高效适应技术以防止遗忘预训练知识。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基础模型和先前适应方法有持续改进。

Conclusion: VESSA提供了一种有效的无监督视觉基础模型适应方法，能够利用多视角物体观察学习对多样化捕获条件的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

### [8] [BioDet: Boosting Industrial Object Detection with Image Preprocessing Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21000)
*Jiaqi Hu,Hongli Xu,Junwen Huang,Peter KT Yu,Slobodan Ilic,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于工业环境中未见物体2D检测的标准化插件式流程，通过低光图像增强和基于基础模型的背景去除来减少域偏移和背景伪影，显著提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计流程在复杂工业环境下（如杂乱、光照差、复杂背景）性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈，需要解决域偏移和背景干扰问题。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，结合低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的背景去除，抑制原始SAM输出的误报，为下游姿态估计提供更可靠的检测结果。

Result: 在真实工业bin-picking基准测试上的大量实验表明，该方法显著提升检测精度，同时推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法在工业环境中具有有效性和实用性，能够显著改善未见物体的检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

### [9] [Deep learning-based automated damage detection in concrete structures using images from earthquake events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21063)
*Abdullah Turer,Yongsheng Bai,Halil Sezen,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用深度学习自动检测地震后混凝土结构中暴露的钢筋，通过YOLOv11模型识别裂缝、剥落和钢筋暴露，构建混合框架评估结构损伤等级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震后及时评估结构完整性对公共安全和应急响应至关重要，需要自动化方法来检测混凝土结构中的暴露钢筋作为损伤指标。

Method: 基于深度学习框架，使用土耳其地震图像数据集，通过微调、数据增强和YOLOv11模型训练，开发自动分类框架识别建筑物内外和结构构件，检测裂缝、剥落和暴露钢筋。

Result: 成功训练了能够检测裂缝、剥落和暴露钢筋的YOLOv11模型，并微调了区分不同结构损伤等级的YOLO模型，构建了可靠的混合损伤评估框架。

Conclusion: 研究表明通过图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法，可以在各种损伤情境下实现快速自动化的灾后损伤检测。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D是一个零样本3D场景图生成框架，利用预训练基础模型实现开放词汇识别，支持增量更新和3D几何接地，适用于机器人应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图生成方法局限于单视图、不支持增量更新、缺乏3D几何接地，这些对具身场景至关重要。

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，通过深度信息将其接地到3D空间，节点包含开放词汇对象特征、3D位置和语义上下文，边捕获空间和语义关系及物体间距离。

Result: 在Replica和HM3D数据集上的实验表明，ZING-3D无需任务特定训练即可有效捕获空间和关系知识。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架成功实现了零样本3D场景图生成，支持增量更新和几何接地，为下游机器人应用提供了有效的场景理解解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

### [11] [WaveSeg: Enhancing Segmentation Precision via High-Frequency Prior and Mamba-Driven Spectrum Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21079)
*Guoan Xu,Yang Xiao,Wenjing Jia,Guangwei Gao,Guo-Jun Qi,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveSeg是一种新颖的语义分割解码器架构，通过在空间域和小波域联合优化特征细化，利用小波域频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，实现高效精确的分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分割网络过度依赖强大的预训练编码器，但使用简单的解码器，导致语义上下文和细节保留之间的权衡不佳。

Method: 提出WaveSeg解码器：1）从小波域学习高频分量作为显式先验；2）双域操作多尺度融合；3）频谱分解注意力块利用Mamba的线性复杂度长程建模；4）重参数化卷积在小波域保持低频语义完整性；5）残差引导融合整合多尺度特征。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，WaveSeg在定量和定性上都优于最先进的方法，实现了高效精确的分割。

Conclusion: WaveSeg通过小波域频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，在语义分割任务中取得了优异性能，证明了联合优化空间域和小波域特征细化的有效性。

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

*Youssef Megahed,Atallah Madi,Dina El Demellawy,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合专家文本概念和视觉语言模型的框架，用于先天性巨结肠症肌间神经丛分类，通过整合医学专业知识提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习模型在肌间神经丛分类中缺乏可解释性、不符合医生决策方式的问题，通过融合专家知识提升模型的临床相关性。

Method: 使用对比语言-图像预训练模型，整合专家来源（医学教材和论文）的文本概念，通过大型语言模型生成提示词，用QuiltNet编码，将临床相关语义线索与视觉特征对齐。

Result: 模型在准确率（83.9%）、精确率（86.6%）和特异性（87.6%）上均优于VGG-19、ResNet-18和ResNet-50等CNN模型。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有潜力，整合专家知识可产生更具临床相关性的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

*Jingtian Zhao,Xueli Xie,Jianxiang Xi,Xiaogang Yang,Haoxuan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于直方图的Retinex模型（HistRetinex），用于快速低光照图像增强，通过将Retinex模型从空间域扩展到直方图域，显著提高了处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Retinex方法在处理大尺寸图像时耗时较长，需要开发更高效的算法。

Method: 定义直方图位置矩阵和计数矩阵，构建基于直方图的Retinex模型和两级优化模型，通过迭代求解光照和反射率直方图，最后进行直方图匹配增强。

Result: HistRetinex在可见性和性能指标上优于现有方法，处理1000*664分辨率图像仅需1.86秒，比现有方法至少节省6.67秒。

Conclusion: HistRetinex是一种高效的低光照图像增强方法，在保持良好增强效果的同时显著提高了处理速度。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了主动视觉推理(AVR)任务，扩展了多模态大语言模型在部分可观察、交互环境中的视觉推理能力，需要智能体通过物理动作主动获取信息、整合多步观察并进行动态决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs主要在静态、完全可观察环境中研究视觉推理，而现实世界信息往往因遮挡或视野限制而不完整。受人类主动探索环境能力的启发，需要开发能够通过感知-推理-行动闭环过程主动获取信息的智能体。

Method: 引入CLEVR-AVR模拟基准和AVR-152k大规模数据集，包含丰富的思维链标注，用于训练在更高阶马尔可夫决策过程中的智能体。开发了PhysVLM-AVR模型，在主动推理、具身推理和被动视觉推理任务上达到最先进性能。

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在CLEVR-AVR、具身推理(OpenEQA, RoboVQA)和被动视觉推理(GeoMath, Geometry30K)任务上取得最先进性能。分析显示当前具身MLLMs虽然能检测信息不完整性，但在通过交互主动获取和整合新信息方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是MLLMs发展的关键方向，当前模型在主动推理能力上存在根本性差距，需要进一步研究如何让智能体像人类一样通过交互主动探索环境来获取信息。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

### [15] [Urban 3D Change Detection Using LiDAR Sensor for HD Map Maintenance and Smart Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21112)
*Hezam Albagami,Haitian Wang,Xinyu Wang,Muhammad Ibrahim,Zainy M. Malakan,Abdullah M. Alqamdi,Mohammed H. Alghamdi,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向城市规模LiDAR的对象中心、不确定性感知变化检测流程，通过多分辨率NDT和点面ICP对齐、高度归一化、基于注册协方差和表面粗糙度的检测水平计算，结合语义实例分割和类别约束二分图分配来处理分割合并情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对垂直偏差、地面坡度、视角不匹配敏感，缺乏对象身份信息；基于点和体素的模型需要大量内存，假设完美预对齐，难以处理分割合并情况且忽略不确定性。

Method: 多分辨率NDT+点面ICP对齐、高度归一化、基于注册协方差和表面粗糙度的检测水平计算、几何代理+语义实例分割+类别约束二分图分配、分块处理、结合3D重叠、法向位移、高度体积差异和直方图距离的实例级决策。

Result: 在15个Subiaco区块上达到95.2%准确率、90.4% mF1和82.6% mIoU，优于Triplet KPConv，在Decreased类别上IoU达到74.8%，提升7.6个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法在城市规模LiDAR变化检测中表现出色，能够有效处理分割合并情况，保持类别一致性，并在部分重叠和采样变化下保持稳定。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

TL;DR: 提出Controllable-LPMoE方法，通过动态控制局部先验来调制冻结的基础模型，实现参数高效微调，提升特定分割任务的细粒度感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模基础模型为下游分割任务提供强大特征表示，但全参数微调计算开销大。现有方法嵌入可训练提示但缺乏语义先验，限制了模型适应性。

Method: 构建轻量级动态混合局部先验提取器，通过异构卷积捕获多样局部先验，使用门控网络动态输出专家先验；设计双向交互适配器，采用余弦对齐可变形注意力和通道自适应尺度增强进行特征交互重组。

Result: 在31个SOTA方法对比中表现出优异分割性能，适用于多种二元对象分割任务。

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE方法通过动态局部先验调制实现了参数高效微调，在分割任务中表现出卓越性能和多任务适应性。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

*Alec Helbling,Shruti Palaskar,Kundan Krishna,Polo Chau,Leon Gatys,Joseph Yitan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SafetyPairs框架，通过生成仅安全相关特征不同的图像对来系统研究图像安全问题，构建了包含3020对图像的安全基准数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集粗糙模糊，仅提供宽泛的安全标签而无法隔离驱动安全差异的具体特征，需要更精细的方法来区分良性图像和问题图像

Method: 利用图像编辑模型对图像进行针对性修改，只改变与安全策略相关的特征从而翻转安全标签，同时保持安全无关细节不变

Result: 构建了包含3020对SafetyPair图像的安全基准，涵盖9个安全类别，揭示了视觉语言模型在区分细微差异图像方面的弱点，并可作为数据增强策略提高轻量级防护模型的训练效率

Conclusion: SafetyPairs提供了首个系统研究细粒度图像安全区别的资源，为评估和改进图像安全检测模型提供了有力工具

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoisyGRPO是一个多模态强化学习框架，通过向视觉输入注入可控噪声来增强探索，并使用贝叶斯框架显式建模优势估计过程，以提升多模态大语言模型的链式思维推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习框架在提升通用链式思维推理能力时，往往难以泛化到训练分布之外，因此需要一种能够增强探索性和鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 提出噪声注入探索策略（在视觉输入中添加高斯噪声）和贝叶斯优势估计（将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推断问题，融合噪声水平和轨迹奖励信息）。

Result: 在标准链式思维质量、通用能力和幻觉基准测试中，NoisyGRPO显著提高了泛化能力和鲁棒性，特别是在小规模多模态大语言模型（如Qwen2.5-VL 3B）的强化学习设置中。

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统性的噪声注入和贝叶斯优势估计，有效提升了多模态大语言模型在链式思维推理中的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于CycleGAN的级联合成器方法，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA，以降低碘对比剂带来的风险，并在下游血管分割和量化任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTPA是诊断肺血管疾病的金标准，但依赖碘对比剂存在肾毒性和过敏反应风险，特别是在高危患者中。本研究旨在开发一种从NCCT生成DCCTPA的方法，避免使用对比剂。

Method: 使用基于CycleGAN的级联合成器，从非对比CT扫描生成数字对比CTPA。研究使用了410对CTPA和NCCT扫描，分为训练/验证集（249对）和测试集（161对）。

Result: 该方法在定量指标上表现最佳（验证集：MAE 156.28，PSNR 20.71，SSIM 0.98；测试集：MAE 165.12，PSNR 20.27，SSIM 0.98），在血管分割任务中Dice、clDice和clRecall指标均有显著提升，血管体积ICC从0.70提高到0.81。

Conclusion: 提出的DCCTPA方法能够有效增强血管结构，特别是在小血管方面，为高风险患者提供了一种无对比剂的替代诊断方案，在下游临床任务中表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

*Guanlin Wu,Boyan Su,Yang Zhao,Pu Wang,Yichen Lin,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了空间智能网格(SIG)，一种结构化网格模式，用于在基础模型中显式编码空间关系，并开发了SIG-informed评估指标来量化模型的内在视觉空间智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础模型中的视觉空间智能评估通常使用纯文本提示和VQA式评分，这掩盖了几何信息、引入了语言捷径，并削弱了对真正空间技能的归因。

Method: 引入SIG作为文本的补充通道，提供场景结构的忠实组合表示；基于SIG开发评估指标；在few-shot上下文学习中测试多模态LLM。

Result: SIG在所有VSI指标上相比纯VQA表示产生了更一致、更稳定和更全面的增益；发布了包含1.4K驾驶帧的SIGBench基准数据集。

Conclusion: SIG作为数据标注和训练模式，在学习和评估视觉空间智能方面具有潜力，能够将空间能力与语言先验分离开来。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM)框架，通过将生成轨迹划分为多个时间片段，每个片段由专门化的小型速度块建模，提高推理效率和样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Flow Matching模型使用单一大型网络学习从噪声到数据的整个生成轨迹，难以同时捕捉不同时间步的独特信号特征，且推理成本高昂。

Method: 使用块状设计将生成轨迹划分为多个时间片段，每个片段由专门化的速度块建模；引入语义特征引导模块，使速度块基于预训练表示的语义丰富特征；采用轻量级特征残差近似策略。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上的实验表明，BFM在保持相似生成性能的同时，实现了2.1倍到4.9倍的推理复杂度加速。

Conclusion: BFM框架在Flow Matching方法中建立了显著改进的帕累托前沿，既提高了推理效率又提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP是一个针对异常检测的token-wise适配框架，通过动态对齐视觉和可学习文本空间来实现细粒度异常学习，解决了现有方法在单一文本空间中对齐不同对象和领域视觉语义的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖单一文本空间来对齐不同对象和领域的视觉语义，这种无差别的对齐阻碍了模型准确捕捉多样化的异常语义。

Method: 将token无关的文本空间扩展为一组正交子空间，通过语义亲和度动态分配每个token到子空间组合，将动态对齐建模为最优传输问题，确保子空间间的充分优化并专注于不同语义。

Result: 广泛的实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过token-wise的动态对齐机制，有效提升了异常检测的性能，特别是在捕捉多样化异常语义方面表现出色。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

Motivation: 现有静态基准存在数据污染和饱和风险，导致性能评估失真，需要更可靠的评估协议来评估多模态大语言模型。

Method: 首先用图表示VQA样本，然后通过整合多模态知识扩展静态基准，使其成为可控的动态演化版本，能够重构问题和扩展问题。

Result: 实验表明KBE缓解了数据污染和饱和风险，提供了对MLLM能力更全面的评估。

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态的评估方法，解决了静态基准的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

TL;DR: TSSR是一种基于离散扩散模型的新型3D网格生成方法，通过并行生成实现高效准确的艺术家风格3D网格生成，支持高达10,000个面片和1024^3的空间分辨率。


<details>

Motivation: 实现高精度令牌预测的同时支持并行生成，相比顺序自回归方法具有显著优势，通过同时查看所有网格令牌来提升效率和可控性。

Method: 采用解耦训练和混合推理策略，将生成过程分为拓扑雕刻和形状细化两个阶段；改进的沙漏架构结合双向注意力和旋转位置嵌入；引入连接损失作为拓扑约束。

Result: 在复杂数据集上的实验表明，TSSR能够生成高质量的3D艺术家风格网格，达到10,000个面片和1024^3的空间分辨率。

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和解耦策略，在3D网格生成中实现了高效性和高质量，为艺术家风格3D内容创作提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

TL;DR: SAGE-3D将3D高斯泼溅升级为可执行、语义和物理对齐的环境，包含对象中心语义标注和物理感知执行连接，构建了首个基于3DGS的VLN基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯泼溅缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性的问题，以缩小仿真到现实的差距，支持视觉语言导航任务。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D框架，包括对象中心语义标注（为3DGS添加对象级细粒度标注）和物理感知执行连接（嵌入碰撞对象并构建丰富的物理接口）。

Result: 发布了包含1K对象标注3DGS室内场景数据的InteriorGS，以及首个基于3DGS的VLN基准SAGE-Bench（含2M VLN数据）。实验显示3DGS场景数据更难收敛但泛化性强，在VLN-CE Unseen任务上提升基线性能31%。

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS升级为语义和物理对齐的可执行环境，为视觉语言导航提供了更真实的仿真平台，显著提升了导航性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

TL;DR: 提出了FineRS框架，通过两阶段强化学习方法解决MLLMs在高分辨率图像中精确定位和分割极小物体的挑战，包含全局语义探索和局部感知细化两个阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在输入分辨率受限的情况下，难以精确理解和定位高分辨率图像中的视觉细节，特别是处理嵌入复杂背景中的极小物体。

Method: 采用粗到精的两阶段管道：全局语义探索(GSE)进行指令引导推理生成文本响应和粗略目标区域，局部感知细化(LPR)精炼该区域生成精确边界框和分割掩码，并引入定位知情的回溯奖励耦合两个阶段。

Result: 在FineRS-4k和公共数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在指令引导分割和视觉推理任务上持续优于最先进的MLLM方法。

Conclusion: FineRS框架有效解决了MLLMs在高分辨率场景中处理极小物体的挑战，通过两阶段强化学习方法实现了更好的分割和推理性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: VL-SAE是一种稀疏自编码器，通过将视觉-语言表示编码为隐藏层激活来统一解释多模态表示，其中每个神经元对应一个由语义相似的图像和文本表示的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于难以将多模态表示的语义映射到统一的概念集合中，视觉-语言对齐的可解释性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出VL-SAE稀疏自编码器，使用基于距离的编码器和两个模态特定的解码器，通过余弦相似度测量多模态表示的语义相似性，并在自监督训练中鼓励语义相似表示具有一致的神经元激活。

Result: 在多个VLM（如CLIP、LLaVA）上的实验表明，VL-SAE在解释和增强视觉-语言对齐方面具有优越能力，能提升零样本图像分类和幻觉消除等下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: VL-SAE能够通过概念级别的对齐来理解和增强视觉-语言表示的对齐，为多模态表示的可解释性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Motivation: 当前计算框架仅限于二维表示，无法捕捉细胞形态在扰动下的复杂性，这成为开发精确虚拟细胞模型的关键瓶颈。

Method: FORM包含形态编码器（通过多通道VQGAN端到端训练学习紧凑的3D细胞形状表示）和基于扩散的扰动轨迹模块。在包含65,000多个多荧光3D细胞体积的大规模数据集上训练。

Result: FORM支持无条件形态合成和条件模拟扰动细胞状态，能够预测下游信号活性、模拟组合扰动效应，并建模未见扰动的形态动力学转换。

Conclusion: FORM和MorphoEval通过高分辨率预测模拟，将形态、扰动和功能联系起来，推动3D虚拟细胞的实现。

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Motivation: 复杂果园环境中，苹果叶病害的表型异质性（病变形态和分布多样性）对传统多尺度特征融合方法构成挑战，这些方法仅整合CNN提取的多层特征，未能充分考虑局部与全局特征间的关系。

Method: 采用多分支识别框架CT-CLIP：CNN提取局部病变细节特征，Vision Transformer捕获全局结构关系，自适应特征融合模块（AFFM）动态融合特征；结合多模态图像-文本学习方法，利用预训练CLIP权重实现视觉特征与病害语义描述的深度对齐。

Conclusion: CT-CLIP在农业病害识别方面表现出强大能力，显著提升了复杂环境条件下的识别精度，为农业应用中的自动化病害识别提供了创新实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

Motivation: 人类注视数据包含注意力、短期意图和未来行动的有价值线索，是建模自我中心行为的强大信号，但现有方法要么仅使用视觉输入，要么将注视作为辅助输入信号。

Method: 提出注视正则化注意力机制，在训练期间使用注视数据来对齐模型关注区域与人类视觉注视，该设计灵活模块化，可泛化到多种使用注意力的VLM架构。

Conclusion: 注视引导的训练能显著提高自我中心VLM的准确性和鲁棒性，为在辅助机器人和人机协作等现实场景中增强VLM预测能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成CT生成中配准误差传播到监督学习的问题，开发更稳健和可泛化的sCT合成模型。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++架构，ResNet-34编码器，联合训练各解剖区域并进行区域微调。损失函数结合L1损失和IMPACT-Synth感知损失。评估Elastix和IMPACT两种配准策略。

Result: 在本地测试集上，IMPACT配准实现了更准确和解剖一致的配准，降低了MAE并生成更真实的解剖结构。但在公开验证集上，Elastix配准得分更高，反映了配准偏差。

Conclusion: 配准误差会传播到监督学习中，影响训练和评估。IMPACT通过促进解剖一致的配准来减轻这种偏差，支持开发更稳健的sCT合成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用固定步数去噪，不考虑下游传输限制。在实际云到设备场景中，有限带宽需要重度压缩，导致细节丢失和计算浪费。

Method: 引入联合端到端训练策略，扩散模型以目标质量级别为条件，学习自适应调制去噪过程，实现保持感知质量的早期停止采样。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比简单的早期停止显著提高了带宽适应生成的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法为带宽受限环境中的高效图像传输提供了有前景的解决方案，仅需最小架构修改和轻量级质量嵌入。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

*Whie Jung,Semin Kim,Junee Kim,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的视觉概念学习框架，能够自适应识别图像相关概念轴并在真实场景中沿这些轴进行视觉概念定位，无需预定义概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言基础视觉概念学习方法局限于少数预定义轴（如颜色、形状），且主要在合成数据集中探索，无法处理真实世界中丰富多样的语义维度。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型和通用提示策略识别多样化的图像相关轴，通过通用概念编码器自适应绑定视觉特征到发现的轴，使用组合锚定目标确保各轴可独立操作。

Result: 在ImageNet、CelebA-HQ和AFHQ数据集上展示了优越的编辑能力，能够处理过于多样而无法手动预定义的真实世界概念，并表现出强大的组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在视觉概念学习和基于文本的编辑方法中表现优异，为处理真实世界复杂视觉概念提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is
available at https://github.com/whieya/Language-grounded-VCL.

TL;DR: ArtiLatent是一个生成框架，能够合成具有精细几何结构、准确关节连接和真实外观的人造3D物体。该方法通过变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜在空间，并使用潜在扩散模型进行多样化采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成关节3D物体时难以同时保证几何一致性、关节准确性和外观真实性，特别是在处理关节依赖的可见性变化方面存在不足。

Method: 联合建模部件几何和关节动力学，将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜在空间；使用潜在扩散模型进行采样；引入关节感知的高斯解码器处理关节相关的可见性变化。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility和ACD数据集上的实验表明，ArtiLatent在几何一致性和外观保真度方面优于现有方法，能够生成更真实的关节3D物体。

Conclusion: 该框架为关节3D物体的合成和操作提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了跨关节配置的视觉真实感。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

### [42] [Anisotropic Pooling for LUT-realizable CNN Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21437)
*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种各向异性池化策略来改进基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法，通过广义中值池化和学习数据依赖的池化系数，提升对非各向同性信号结构的处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法使用平均池化融合不同方向的像素块结果，但这种方法不适合处理各向异性的信号结构，需要更有效的融合策略。

Method: 引入广义中值池化方法，并进一步扩展为学习数据依赖的池化系数，使不同方向的像素块贡献能够自适应加权。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试中，各向异性池化策略在感知质量和数值指标上都优于现有的LUT可实现的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略能够有效提升基于查找表的CNN图像恢复方法的性能，特别是在处理非各向同性信号结构时表现更优。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenHype提出了一种使用双曲潜在空间表示3D场景层次结构的新方法，解决了现有方法在推理时间和泛化能力方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D场景层次结构建模方法存在显著局限性：要么需要多次渲染来捕捉不同粒度的嵌入，显著增加推理时间；要么依赖预定义的封闭集离散层次结构，对现实世界中多样和细微结构的泛化能力差。

Method: OpenHype使用连续双曲潜在空间来表示场景层次结构，利用双曲几何的特性自然编码多尺度关系，并通过潜在空间中的测地线路径实现层次结构的平滑遍历。

Result: 该方法在标准基准测试中优于最先进的方法，在3D场景理解方面表现出更高的效率和适应性。

Conclusion: OpenHype通过双曲几何表示成功解决了3D场景层次结构建模的挑战，为自主代理提供更全面的环境理解能力。

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: PhysWorld框架通过利用模拟器合成物理演示，有效解决了数据稀缺问题，实现了高效、准确和快速的可变形物体动力学预测，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频异常检测研究主要关注离线场景，而在线VAD由于实时性约束和计算强度很少受到关注，需要开发能够在实时条件下有效工作的解决方案。

Method: 使用流式输入到视觉语言模型，结合LSTM启发的预测机制捕获时间依赖关系，设计评分队列和异常先验来动态存储最近分数并覆盖监控场景中的所有异常。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence两个大型数据集上的评估表明，MoniTor优于最先进方法，且无需训练即可与弱监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: MoniTor为在线视频异常检测提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案，通过结合预训练模型和记忆机制，在实时约束下实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidSplice是一个新颖的视频修复框架，通过解耦视频修复为两个子任务：多帧一致性图像修复和掩码区域运动传播，引入间隔帧先验来指导修复过程，提升时空稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在严重内容退化情况下表现不佳，往往忽视时空稳定性，对视频后半部分控制不足。

Method: 提出VidSplice框架，包含CoSpliced模块进行首帧传播策略，以及上下文控制器模块编码一致先验并注入I2V生成主干，有效约束生成过程中的内容失真。

Result: 广泛评估表明VidSplice在多样化视频修复场景中达到竞争性性能，显著改善前景对齐和运动稳定性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VidSplice通过解耦视频修复任务和引入间隔帧先验，有效解决了现有方法在时空稳定性方面的不足，为视频修复提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中的黑盒性质问题，为临床医生提供透明可验证的解释，增强对自动化诊断的信任并识别潜在失败模式。

Method: 在BiomedCLIP诊断分类器上训练基于转码器的稀疏自编码器，将医学图像表示分解为可解释的视觉模式。在MIMIC-CXR数据集上训练100个转码器，发现约5000个单语义模式。

Result: 发现了涵盖心脏、肺部、胸膜、结构、设备和伪影类别的约5000个单语义模式，在五个关键发现上实现了有竞争力的诊断准确性，预测可分解为20-50个可解释模式。

Conclusion: CXR-LanIC证明了医学AI系统可以同时实现准确性和可解释性，通过透明、临床基础的解释支持更安全的临床部署。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Result: 在四个组织病理学子类型分类基准上的实验表明，该方法优于现有模型

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中发挥关键作用

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of

performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

Conclusion: 该工作为条件引导提供了新视角，并开启了自适应设计的潜力。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

*Lorenzo Basile,Valentino Maiorca,Diego Doimo,Francesco Locatello,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于信号处理的方法来分析注意力头在语义和视觉属性上的专门化，并发现仅编辑1%的注意力头就能可靠地抑制或增强目标概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言和视觉语言模型的内部机制，特别是注意力头在语义和视觉属性上的专门化，以更好地理解和控制这些模型。

Method: 基于既有的可解释性方法，通过信号处理的视角重新解释使用最终解码层探测中间激活的实践，从而分析多个样本并基于与目标概念的相关性对注意力头进行排序。

Result: 在单模态和多模态Transformer中都发现了头部层面的专门化一致模式，仅编辑1%的头部就能可靠地抑制或增强目标概念，在语言任务和视觉语言任务上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 注意力层中存在可解释和可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley方法，通过冻结预训练单模态模型，仅学习它们之间的小型交叉注意力桥接来实现视频到音频的同步生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要端到端重新训练多模态系统，计算成本高且缺乏模块化。Foley Control旨在保持预训练模型优势的同时，实现高效的视频-音频同步。

Method: 将V-JEPA2视频嵌入连接到冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本到音频模型，在现有文本交叉注意力后插入紧凑的视频交叉注意力层，通过视频token池化减少内存并稳定训练。

Result: 在视频-音频基准测试中，Foley Control在时间和语义对齐方面表现优异，参数量远少于现有多模态系统，同时保持提示驱动的可控性和模块化特性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、模块化的视频到Foley生成方案，其桥接设计可扩展到其他音频模态如语音生成。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

TL;DR: 提出了Chunk-GRPO方法，将GRPO优化从步级提升到块级，解决优势归因不准确和忽略生成时序动态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在基于流匹配的文本到图像生成中表现出潜力，但面临两个关键限制：优势归因不准确，以及忽略生成的时序动态特性。

Method: 将连续步骤分组为捕捉流匹配内在时序动态的'块'，在块级别优化策略，并引入可选的加权采样策略来进一步提升性能。

Result: 广泛实验表明Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面均取得优越结果。

Conclusion: 块级优化为基于GRPO的方法展现了良好前景。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

TL;DR: MATrack是一个专为夜间无人机跟踪设计的自适应系统，通过多尺度层次融合、自适应关键令牌门和夜间模板校准器三个核心模块，在保持81 FPS实时速度的同时，在UAVDark135基准上相比SOTA方法实现了5.9%精度、5.4%归一化精度和4.2% AUC的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪面临低光照条件、杂乱背景和频繁视角变化的挑战，现有方法存在视觉伪影、计算成本高和难以充分利用动态物体信息的问题。

Method: 提出MATrack系统，包含三个核心模块：多尺度层次融合增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性；自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的物体信息；夜间模板校准器确保长序列中的稳定跟踪性能。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，精度、归一化精度和AUC分别比最先进方法提升了5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。真实无人机平台测试验证了系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: MATrack能够为夜间搜救和边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持，在性能和效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

TL;DR: TIGER是一个两阶段的文本图像引导超分辨率框架，通过"文本优先、图像在后"的范式，将字形恢复与图像增强解耦，在提升图像质量的同时保持文本可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，导致图像质量与文本可读性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段重建精确的文本结构，第二阶段使用这些文本结构来引导全图像超分辨率，实现字形到图像的引导。

Result: TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在保持整体图像质量的同时显著提高了文本可读性。

Conclusion: TIGER通过解耦文本恢复和图像增强，成功打破了图像质量与文本可读性之间的权衡，为场景文本超分辨率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

TL;DR: 使用深度学习模型自动检测MEG记录中的发作间期癫痫尖波，提出两种神经网络架构并在59名患者数据上训练，性能优于现有方法，同时采用交互式机器学习策略提高标注质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耐药性癫痫的术前评估需要定位癫痫灶，MEG中的发作间期尖波是关键生物标志物，但手动检测繁琐且易出错，现有自动化方法不适合临床实践。

Method: 提出基于特征的ANN和CNN两种模型架构，在59名患者数据上训练，采用交互式机器学习策略迭代改进数据标注质量，并与现有最优模型进行比较。

Result: 两种模型在10名测试患者上均优于现有最优模型（F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44），交互式学习策略证明模型对噪声标注具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单架构的模型在分析复杂且标注不完美的数据时具有鲁棒性，交互式机器学习方法能加速数据标注，模型是自动检测发作间期尖波的有效工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测面临像素级标注成本高的问题，导致相关子任务需要分别训练模型，限制了泛化能力

Method: 使用多模态扩散管道生成超过139,000张高分辨率图像的S3OD数据集，结合扩散和DINO-v3特征提取标签；提出简化多掩码解码器处理检测中的歧义性

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化中实现20-50%错误率降低，微调版本在DIS和HR-SOD基准测试中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 大规模合成数据和歧义感知架构能显著提升显著目标检测的泛化性能，减少对昂贵人工标注的依赖

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了Modest-Align轻量级跨模态对齐框架，通过随机扰动和嵌入平滑策略解决资源受限场景下模型过度自信和性能下降问题，在少量数据和计算资源下实现竞争性检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源受限场景中，由于数据质量差或相关性弱导致的跨模态模型过度自信和性能下降问题。现有对比学习方法依赖单正样本对，会加剧对不确定样本的过度自信。

Method: 使用两种互补策略：随机扰动（引入受控噪声模拟不确定性）和嵌入平滑（在嵌入空间校准相似度分布），共同减少过度自信并提升噪声或弱对齐样本的性能。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，Modest-Align在检索任务中优于最先进方法，仅用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间就获得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界低资源场景下的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然在潜在扩散变换器和整流流技术方面取得进展，但仍存在几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影等问题，破坏了真实3D场景的错觉。3D一致视频生成对生成和重建任务有重要影响。

Method: 通过成对极线几何约束进行偏好优化，直接解决不稳定的相机轨迹和几何伪影问题。该方法高效实施几何原理，无需端到端可微性，在静态场景和动态相机上训练确保高质量测量。

Result: 评估表明，经典几何约束比现代学习指标提供更稳定的优化信号，学习指标会产生噪声目标损害对齐质量。模型能有效泛化到各种动态内容。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种实用方法，在不影响视觉质量的情况下生成空间一致的视频。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

Motivation: 解决不同领域点云数据规模有限的问题，同时避免混合领域预训练知识可能无法与下游任务对齐导致的性能下降。

Method: 设计异构领域适配器（包含预训练时的适应模式和微调时的融合模式）和领域特征生成器，指导点云特征适应不同下游任务。

Result: 在四个不同点云分析任务中表现优异：ScanObjectNN物体分类达到95.18%，Bosphorus面部表情识别达到88.45%。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能够有效整合跨领域知识，通过单一预训练在多个下游任务中实现卓越性能，解决了领域适应和知识融合的关键问题。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上的实验表明，Gompertz-CNN相比传统蒸馏方法显著提升性能，在CIFAR-10上获得最高8%准确率提升，在CIFAR-100上获得最高4%准确率提升。

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN框架通过模拟学生模型学习进程的动态特性，有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能，在不同教师-学生架构组合中均表现出优越性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Motivation: 解决纯IMU方法在平移估计和多人相对定位方面的局限性，因为惯性线索本质上是自参考的，无法提供他人的直接空间参考。

Method: 使用超宽带测距(UWB)估计传感器间的绝对距离，将距离信息与惯性观测融合到结构化状态空间模型中，并采用新颖的两步优化方法来跟踪全局轨迹。

Conclusion: Group Inertial Poser方法通过结合IMU和UWB技术，实现了对多人全身运动的精确跟踪，为野外多人运动捕捉提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NACTI野生动物数据集存在严重的类别不平衡问题，最大的'Head'类别占数据集的50%以上，这影响了模型对尾部类别的识别性能，需要专门的长尾识别方法来解决。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究了多种LTR损失函数和LTR敏感的正则化方法，构建了Reduced-Bias测试集来评估领域迁移性能。

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40% Top-1准确率，相比标准交叉熵的95.51%有显著提升；在领域迁移测试中达到52.55%准确率，优于WCE损失的51.20%。

Conclusion: LTR增强的调度器选择与先进的LTR损失函数结合在野生动物识别领域表现一致优异，但LTR方法仍无法充分解决严重领域迁移下尾部类别的灾难性性能下降问题。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North

LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要监督学习，而该方法仅基于附近突触更相似的观察进行分类，无需预先指定类型数量。

Method: 利用附近突触比随机突触更相似的原理，对果蝇数据进行无监督分类。

Result: 成功应用于果蝇数据，能够自动识别突触类型。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需先验知识的突触分类方式，并能帮助选择覆盖突触结构范围的ground-truth数据。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了UNI和Virchow2两种基础模型作为特征提取器在皮肤病理学全玻片图像分类中的性能，发现Virchow2在大多数分类器中表现更优，逻辑回归达到90%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全玻片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类，以应对日益增长的诊断需求。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2基础模型提取补丁级嵌入特征，通过均值聚合策略整合为玻片级特征，然后训练多种机器学习分类器（逻辑回归、梯度提升树、随机森林）。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数玻片级分类器中优于UNI，逻辑回归模型达到90%准确率，但差异无统计学意义。均值聚合方法提供了可靠的玻片级特征表示。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动化WSI分类中具有巨大潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法，并为未来玻片级表示学习的进展铺平了道路。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

TL;DR: WorldGrow是一个用于无限扩展3D场景合成的分层框架，通过利用预训练3D模型的生成先验，实现几何一致且外观逼真的大规模连续环境生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临关键挑战：2D提升方法存在视图间几何和外观不一致问题，3D隐式表示难以扩展，当前3D基础模型大多面向对象而非场景级别生成。

Method: 包含三个核心组件：(1)高质量场景块数据提取管道；(2)支持上下文感知场景扩展的3D块修复机制；(3)确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度的由粗到细生成策略。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到最先进性能，并独特支持具有照片级真实感和结构一致输出的无限场景生成。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了构建大规模虚拟环境的能力，并具有构建未来世界模型的潜力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

Motivation: 解决生态学中因缺乏对黑盒神经网络模型的信任而阻碍计算机视觉技术应用的问题，通过提供预测证据和记录部署限制来增强模型可信度。

Method: 使用Faster R-CNN检测冰川湾国家公园航拍图像中的海豹，应用梯度类激活映射（HiResCAM、LayerCAM）、局部可解释模型无关解释（LIME）和基于扰动的解释方法生成预测解释。

Result: 解释集中在海豹躯干和轮廓而非背景，移除海豹会降低检测置信度，揭示了模型将海豹与黑冰和岩石混淆的系统性错误模式。

Conclusion: 通过将目标检测与后解释性相结合，可以超越"黑盒"预测，为保护监测开发可审计的决策支持工具，并确定了针对性数据整理和增强的改进方向。

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖参考图像或大量训练，且往往只解决角色一致性，将背景一致性留给图像到视频模型处理。生成具有一致角色和背景的多个视频仍是一个重大挑战。

Method: 基于对DiT注意力机制和中间特征的系统分析，发现其在去噪过程中能提取前景掩码和识别匹配点。首先生成身份视频并缓存中间变量，然后将这些缓存变量注入到新生成视频的相应位置。

Result: 实验结果表明，BachVid在无需额外训练的情况下实现了生成视频的强一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种新颖高效的解决方案，无需依赖参考图像或额外训练即可实现一致视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

Motivation: 探索视觉扩散模型在解决长期存在的几何问题上的潜力，将几何推理重新定义为图像生成任务。

Method: 将几何问题实例视为图像，训练标准视觉扩散模型从高斯噪声生成近似解图像，学习将噪声几何结构转换为正确配置。

Result: 模型成功生成了与精确解高度匹配的有效近似解，证明了该方法在多个困难几何问题上的有效性。

Conclusion: 在图像空间中操作提供了一个通用实用的框架来近似解决困难几何问题，为处理更广泛几何任务打开了大门。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测视觉模型中的视觉属性依赖，自反思机制显著提升检测性能，适用于现实世界中的先进模型分析。

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

Motivation: 让专家和非专家都能通过简单的手绘草图创建BIM模型，降低BIM建模的技术门槛。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型的多智能体框架，结合感知提取、人工反馈、模式验证和自动化BIM脚本生成，将草图迭代优化为结构化JSON布局，再转换为可执行脚本生成3D BIM模型。

Result: 在10个不同平面图上测试，门窗口检测初始准确率高，墙体检测从83%开始，经过几次反馈迭代后达到近乎完美对齐。所有类别的精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过0.83，几何误差通过反馈修正逐步降至零。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型驱动的多智能体推理能够使BIM创建对专家和非专家都变得可访问，仅需使用手绘草图即可完成。

Abstract: This study introduces a human-in-the-loop pipeline that converts unscaled,
hand-drawn floor plan sketches into semantically consistent 3D BIM models. The
workflow leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) within a
multi-agent framework, combining perceptual extraction, human feedback, schema
validation, and automated BIM scripting. Initially, sketches are iteratively
refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later,
these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM
models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence:
openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial
pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect
alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision,
recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE)
progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study
demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation
accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型在开放领域艺术创作中要么遵循熟悉文化模式，要么在追求新颖性时牺牲连贯性的问题。

Method: 使用两个GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念在艺术品中共同出现的可能性，文化背景模型估计这些组合在艺术家作品中的典型程度。CAS选择高连贯性、低典型性的组合。

Result: 人类评估显示CAS在原创性和和谐度方面优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，与艺术专业学生表现相当。定量研究显示比GPT-4o产生更多样化输出和更广泛的概念空间探索。

Conclusion: 人工文化异化可以释放自主代理的创造潜力，在保持连贯性的同时生成偏离文化惯例的新颖创意。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

Abstract: Fuzzy numbers are commonly represented with fuzzy sets. Their objective is to
better represent imprecise data. However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not
as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension
rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high
computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the
results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two
triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more
problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the
number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of
fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a
different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines
operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <,
<=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational
examples. The C++ implementation is available from a public GitHub repository.

Abstract: Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is
a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD).
In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across
differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical
framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including
Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription
attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily
quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a
standardized metric of medication coverage, \emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our
pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by
lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the
system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study
(25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated
benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance
is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and
record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall:
Qwen2.5-32B achieves \textbf{93.4\%} coverage with \textbf{93.0\%} exact-match
accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains
\textbf{93.1\%}/\textbf{92.2\%}. A brief error review highlights three common
issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms,
handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from
the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g.,
``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle,
site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this
approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence,
and retention in real-world settings.

Motivation: 基于社会认识论研究，探讨AI系统作为人工认识权威的地位，以及如何合理地在AI与人类判断之间进行权衡，特别是在高风险情境下。

Method: 通过分析AI预占主义观点及其经典反对意见，发展出总体证据观点作为替代方案，强调AI输出应作为贡献性理由而非完全替代。

Result: 提出总体证据观点具有三个关键优势：缓解专业知识萎缩、为人机监督提供认识论依据、解释AI不可靠时的合理不信任。

Conclusion: 总体证据观点为确定何时合理依赖AI提供了原则性方法，特别适用于需要严格可靠性的高风险情境，尽管在实践中要求较高。

Abstract: When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on
recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems
qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated
reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the
view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's
independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism
- such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic
bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing
authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a
more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to
this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than
outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This
approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by
keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful
human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI
when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this
account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified,
particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.

Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature
of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to
non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL),
single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic
complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent
framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into
spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components,
including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic
enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent
pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity
extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a
review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the
generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system
using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive
SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and
three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall
accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review
and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy
of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review
agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system
generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than
those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and
provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems,
advancing the development of autonomous GIS.

TL;DR: MedAlign是一个用于医学视觉问答的新框架，通过多模态直接偏好优化、检索感知专家混合架构和联邦治理机制，解决大型视觉语言模型在医疗应用中的幻觉问题、推理效率低下和多机构协作困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在医疗临床服务部署中面临三个关键挑战：产生与视觉证据不符的幻觉答案、固定深度推理的低效率、以及多机构协作的困难。

Method: 提出多模态直接偏好优化(mDPO)目标，将偏好学习与视觉上下文对齐；设计检索感知专家混合(RA-MoE)架构，通过图像和文本相似性将查询路由到专门的专家模型；采用联邦治理机制，让选定的专家基于本地元认知不确定性估计器进行迭代链式思维推理。

Result: 在三个代表性Med-VQA数据集上的实验表明，MedAlign实现了最先进的性能，比强检索增强基线在F1分数上提升了11.85%，同时与固定深度CoT方法相比平均推理长度减少了51.60%。

Conclusion: MedAlign框架通过视觉对齐、专家路由和自适应推理，有效解决了LVLM在医疗应用中的关键挑战，为智能医疗提供了可靠的技术方案。

Abstract: Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare.
However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical
services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to
hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of
fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration.
To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel
framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual
Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal
Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference
learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware
Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text
similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e.,
an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive
reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a
federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on
clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive
experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented
baselines by up to $11.85\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the
average reasoning length by $51.60\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效处理观测数据中的混杂偏差，在存在未观测混杂因素的环境中表现优于标准DQN算法

Abstract: A key task in Artificial Intelligence is learning effective policies for
controlling agents in unknown environments to optimize performance measures.
Off-policy learning methods, like Q-learning, allow learners to make optimal
decisions based on past experiences. This paper studies off-policy learning
from biased data in complex and high-dimensional domains where \emph{unobserved
confounding} cannot be ruled out a priori. Building on the well-celebrated Deep
Q-Network (DQN), we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm
robust to confounding biases in observed data. Specifically, our algorithm
attempts to find a safe policy for the worst-case environment compatible with
the observations. We apply our method to twelve confounded Atari games, and
find that it consistently dominates the standard DQN in all games where the
observed input to the behavioral and target policies mismatch and unobserved
confounders exist.

Abstract: This paper presents a first empirical study of agentic AI as autonomous
decision-makers in decentralized governance. Using more than 3K proposals from
major protocols, we build an agentic AI voter that interprets proposal
contexts, retrieves historical deliberation data, and independently determines
its voting position. The agent operates within a realistic financial simulation
environment grounded in verifiable blockchain data, implemented through a
modular composable program (MCP) workflow that defines data flow and tool usage
via Agentics framework. We evaluate how closely the agent's decisions align
with the human and token-weighted outcomes, uncovering strong alignments
measured by carefully designed evaluation metrics. Our findings demonstrate
that agentic AI can augment collective decision-making by producing
interpretable, auditable, and empirically grounded signals in realistic DAO
governance settings. The study contributes to the design of explainable and
economically rigorous AI agents for decentralized financial systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恐慌发作是急性恐惧和痛苦发作，及时干预能帮助恢复稳定，但训练此类模型的合适数据集因伦理和后勤问题而稀缺。

Method: 引入PACE数据集（基于第一人称叙事构建的高痛苦发作数据），训练PACER咨询模型（提供共情和指导性支持），使用监督学习和模拟偏好对齐优化，提出PanicEval多维评估框架。

Result: PACER在咨询师侧指标和客户情感改善方面优于强基线，人类评估显示在恐慌场景中一致优于通用、CBT基和GPT-4驱动的模型。

Conclusion: PACER模型在恐慌发作干预中表现出实际价值，为心理急救提供了有效的AI支持解决方案。

Abstract: Panic attacks are acute episodes of fear and distress, in which timely,
appropriate intervention can significantly help individuals regain stability.
However, suitable datasets for training such models remain scarce due to
ethical and logistical issues. To address this, we introduce PACE, which is a
dataset that includes high-distress episodes constructed from first-person
narratives, and structured around the principles of Psychological First Aid
(PFA). Using this data, we train PACER, a counseling model designed to provide
both empathetic and directive support, which is optimized through supervised
learning and simulated preference alignment. To assess its effectiveness, we
propose PanicEval, a multi-dimensional framework covering general counseling
quality and crisis-specific strategies. Experimental results show that PACER
outperforms strong baselines in both counselor-side metrics and client affect
improvement. Human evaluations further confirm its practical value, with PACER
consistently preferred over general, CBT-based, and GPT-4-powered models in
panic scenarios (Code is available at https://github.com/JihyunLee1/PanicToCalm

TL;DR: 提出了NeuroGenPoisoning攻击框架，通过神经元归因和遗传优化生成对抗性外部知识，能够大规模生成有效的RAG中毒知识，解决知识冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击方法忽略了模型内部表示动态和神经元级敏感性，且未充分考虑与强参数化知识的知识冲突机制。

Method: 首先识别与上下文中毒知识强相关的毒响应神经元，然后使用遗传算法进化对抗性段落以最大化激活这些神经元，通过观察到的归因信号重用有前景但初始不成功的外部知识变体。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上实验，持续实现超过90%的人口覆盖成功率，同时保持流畅性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了知识冲突问题，能够大规模生成有效的RAG中毒知识。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically integrate external knowledge during inference, improving their
factual accuracy and adaptability. However, adversaries can inject poisoned
external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing
attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG,
they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and
neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not
been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric
knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning,
a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG
guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method
first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly
correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic
algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons.
Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned
RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful
external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time,
Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge
conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate
consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over
90% while preserving fluency. Empirical evidence shows that our method
effectively resolves knowledge conflict.

TL;DR: 提出EGO-Prompt框架，通过进化图优化自动设计更好的提示和推理过程，在领域特定任务中显著提升LLM性能，并输出可解释的语义因果图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中为LLMs设计领域特定任务的最优提示和推理过程既必要又具挑战性，需要解决如何整合领域知识、提升推理效率以及为领域专家提供知识整合指导等关键问题。

Method: EGO-Prompt从专家构建的初始语义因果图开始，通过因果引导的文本梯度过程分两步优化：生成确定性推理指导，并适应LLM有效利用指导与原始输入，使用迭代优化算法结合真实标签精炼语义因果图和推理机制。

Result: 在公共卫生、交通和人类行为任务中测试，EGO-Prompt比最先进方法F1分数提高7.32%-12.61%，使小模型以不到20%成本达到大模型性能，并输出精炼的领域特定语义因果图提升可解释性。

Conclusion: EGO-Prompt框架成功解决了领域特定任务中LLM提示和推理过程的自动化优化问题，显著提升性能同时降低成本，并为领域知识整合提供可解释的指导。

Abstract: Designing optimal prompts and reasoning processes for large language models
(LLMs) on domain-specific tasks is both necessary and challenging in real-world
applications. Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning
efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration
hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we
propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an
automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes
and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a
general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG)
descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined
and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may
be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs,
EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two
steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG
for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the
guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm
further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual
gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public
health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves
7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to
reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost. It
also outputs a refined, domain-specific SCG that improves interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在需要单一确定性答案的任务上表现优异，但在概率指令跟随(PIF)任务上表现不佳，存在偏见问题，影响需要非确定性行为的应用如人类行为模拟、内容多样化和多人游戏。

Method: SSoT提示方法：先让LLM输出随机字符串生成足够熵，然后通过操作该字符串提取随机性来推导最终答案，在保持多样性的同时遵循特定约束。

Result: SSoT显著提高了LLMs的PIF性能，接近伪随机数生成器的理想性能。在NoveltyBench上的实验表明SSoT还能增强开放任务的响应多样性。

Conclusion: SSoT是一种简单有效的提示方法，能够解决LLMs在概率指令跟随任务中的偏见问题，提高输出多样性，适用于需要非确定性行为的各种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the
ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our
experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks
to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型在现实部署中面临分布偏移和新任务挑战，静态零样本能力不足，需要持续学习方法在不遗忘已有知识的情况下适应新环境。

Method: 采用低秩适应技术，将任务特定的权重更新约束在模型当前参数的近似零空间内，最小化对已学知识的干扰。

Result: 实验表明该框架有效保护零样本迁移能力，在持续学习基准上取得有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NuSA-CL为现实应用中持续演化的零样本视觉语言模型提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, enabling deployment in a wide range of
real-world tasks without additional task-specific training. However, in real
deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these
models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts,
static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for
continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for
Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework
designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and
constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space
of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with
previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot
capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or
costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead,
making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world
continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only
effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly
competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results
position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving
zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法依赖人工经验、统计方法或图形准则，容易出错、依赖理想化假设和大数据，且在多变量时间序列上存在数据稀缺和过拟合问题。

Method: 使用组扩张卷积和共享核来指数级减少参数数量，同时学习带有时延的变量表示；结合全局和局部约束实现网络间信息共享；设计了数据生成方法来产生带时延的多变量时间序列。

Result: 在常用基准测试和生成数据集上的广泛实验表明，Shylock在少样本和正常多变量时间序列上都优于两种现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Shylock方法能有效解决多变量时间序列因果发现中的数据稀缺和过拟合问题，并开发了Tcausal库便于使用，已部署在EarthDataMiner平台上。

Abstract: Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and
generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two
existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS. We also
developed Tcausal, a library for easy use and deployed it on the EarthDataMiner
platform

Abstract: We propose OutboundEval, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large

Unlike existing methods that suffer from three key limitations - insufficient
dataset diversity and category coverage, unrealistic user simulation, and
inaccurate evaluation metrics - OutboundEval addresses these issues through a
structured framework. First, we design a benchmark spanning six major business

process decomposition, weighted scoring, and domain-adaptive metrics. Second,
we develop a large-model-driven User Simulator that generates diverse,
persona-rich virtual users with realistic behaviors, emotional variability, and
communication styles, providing a controlled yet authentic testing environment.
Third, we introduce a dynamic evaluation method that adapts to task variations,
integrating automated and human-in-the-loop assessment to measure task
execution accuracy, professional knowledge application, adaptability, and user
experience quality. Experiments on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal distinct
trade-offs between expert-level task completion and interaction fluency,
offering practical insights for building reliable, human-like outbound AI
systems. OutboundEval establishes a practical, extensible, and domain-oriented
standard for benchmarking LLMs in professional applications.

Conclusion: 总结了将OOD检测集成到系统生命周期中的注意事项，并指出了跨领域自主系统安全开发和运营的未来挑战和研究方向。

Abstract: The operational capabilities and application domains of AI-enabled autonomous
systems have expanded significantly in recent years due to advances in robotics
and machine learning (ML). Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems
rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as
it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations
throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD)
data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research,
development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review
analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for
autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by
defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the
factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection
challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used
throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the
lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We
discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of
when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining
the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation
of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UCT算法对游戏奖励尺度敏感，在具有密集奖励的游戏中使用固定探索常数会导致性能问题，需要开发对奖励尺度不敏感的自适应λ选择策略。

Method: 评估了文献中已有的λ策略以及五种新策略，包括基于Q值经验标准差的方法λ=2σ。

Result: 新提出的λ=2σ策略在广泛任务中优于现有λ策略，无论是使用单一参数值还是优化所有可用参数时的峰值性能。

Conclusion: 推荐使用λ=2σ作为UCT探索常数的自适应选择策略，该方法对游戏奖励尺度不敏感且性能优越。

Abstract: The Upper Confidence Bounds For Trees (UCT) algorithm is not agnostic to the
reward scale of the game it is applied to. For zero-sum games with the sparse
rewards of $\{-1,0,1\}$ at the end of the game, this is not a problem, but many
games often feature dense rewards with hand-picked reward scales, causing a
node's Q-value to span different magnitudes across different games. In this
paper, we evaluate various strategies for adaptively choosing the UCT
exploration constant $\lambda$, called $\lambda$-strategies, that are agnostic
to the game's reward scale. These $\lambda$-strategies include those proposed
in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental
results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\lambda$-strategies,
which is to choose $\lambda$ as $2 \cdot \sigma$ where $\sigma$ is the
empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search
tree. This method outperforms existing $\lambda$-strategies across a wide range
of tasks both in terms of a single parameter value and the peak performances
obtained by optimizing all available parameters.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但存在严重安全风险，包括有害内容生成和越狱攻击。现有缓解策略依赖注入启发式安全信号，往往会抑制推理能力，无法解决安全与推理的权衡问题。

Method: 分析模型推理轨迹发现Self-Jailbreak现象，提出Chain-of-Guardrail训练框架，通过重组或回溯不安全的推理步骤，引导模型回到安全轨迹，同时保持有效推理链。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoG显著提升了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于之前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架有效解决了大型推理模型的安全与推理权衡问题，通过系统性干预推理过程实现了安全性的显著提升而不损害推理性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

Motivation: 当前可信AI研究主要采用技术中心方法，过度关注可靠性、鲁棒性等技术属性，而忽视了理解真实世界环境中AI可信度所需的社会技术维度。

Method: 对AIES和FAccT会议论文集进行范围综述，系统分析可信度的定义、操作化和应用方式，重点关注概念化方法、测量方法、验证技术、应用领域和基础价值观。

Result: 研究发现虽然透明度、问责制和鲁棒性等技术属性的定义取得显著进展，但存在关键差距：当前研究过度强调技术精度而牺牲社会伦理考量，AI系统的社会技术性质探索不足，可信度成为由有权定义者塑造的争议概念。

Conclusion: 需要结合技术严谨性与社会、文化和制度考量的跨学科方法推进可信AI，建议AI伦理社区采用真正解决AI系统与社会复杂互动的综合框架，促进惠及所有利益相关者的负责任技术发展。

Abstract: Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI
ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts
techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as
reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical
dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT
communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness,
identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding
of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings
to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined,
operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis
focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and
validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical
attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings
reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical
precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The
sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness
emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with
social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing
trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to
adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between
AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological
development that benefits all stakeholders.

### [93] [Towards Reliable Code-as-Policies: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Embodied Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21302)
*Sanghyun Ahn,Wonje Choi,Junyong Lee,Jinwoo Park,Honguk Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合符号验证和交互验证的神经符号具身任务规划框架，通过生成探索性代码主动获取环境观测，在动态和部分可观测环境中显著提升了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM代码即策略方法在动态或部分可观测环境中存在环境基础不足的问题，导致代码生成不完整或不正确，影响任务成功率。

Method: 采用神经符号框架，在代码生成过程中加入显式符号验证和交互验证，生成探索性代码主动与环境交互获取缺失观测，同时保持任务相关状态。

Result: 在RLBench和真实世界动态部分可观测场景中，任务成功率比Code-as-Policies基线提升46.2%，任务相关动作可执行性达到86.8%以上。

Conclusion: 该框架通过集成验证过程增强了生成代码的环境基础，显著提高了动态环境中任务规划的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic
generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents
such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence.
However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited
environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable
settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or
incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied
task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and
interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation
phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with
the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant
states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code,
resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex
environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings
across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over
Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of
task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in
dynamic environments.

TL;DR: CXRAgent是一个基于LLM的导演编排多阶段代理，用于胸部X光片分析，通过工具协调、多阶段推理和团队协作提升诊断能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CXR分析模型难以适应新诊断任务和复杂推理场景，现有代理依赖单一诊断流程且缺乏工具可靠性评估机制。

Method: 采用导演编排的三阶段方法：工具调用（带证据驱动验证器）、诊断规划（组建专家团队）、协作决策（整合上下文记忆）。

Result: 在各种CXR解释任务上表现出色，能提供视觉证据并良好泛化到不同复杂度的临床任务。

Conclusion: CXRAgent通过多阶段协作和证据验证机制，显著提升了CXR诊断的适应性和可信度。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety
of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR
interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic
tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have
emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability
through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc.
However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack
mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and
credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated,
multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates
the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates
a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the
Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual
evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning:
Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a
targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly,
defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive
and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent
integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories,
synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on
various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong
performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks
of different complexity. Code and data are valuable at this

*Lufan Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Magellan框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和分层引导系统，将创造性生成重新定义为对LLM潜在概念空间的原则性探索，显著提升了生成想法的创新性和合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在生成创新想法时往往局限于训练数据中的高概率概念，以及现有搜索方法依赖不可靠的自评估启发式的问题。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)，结合分层引导系统：远距离方向由"语义指南针"向量引导，局部决策由景观感知价值函数替代有缺陷的自评估。

Result: 在生成科学想法方面显著优于ReAct和ToT等强基线方法，在合理性和创新性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 对于创造性发现，原则性引导搜索比无约束自主性更有效，为LLMs成为创新合作伙伴铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

### [96] [Boosting Accuracy and Efficiency of Budget Forcing in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21398)
*Ravindra Aribowo Tarunokusumo,Rafael Fernandes Cunha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出结合强化学习的框架，在1.5B模型上提高数学推理性能，相比纯SFT方法在GSM8K数据集上准确率更高且token使用量减少40%以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预算强制方法需要长上下文推理轨迹的监督微调，导致小模型因冗长响应而性能下降，需要提高token效率并提升小模型的数学推理性能

Method: 集成强化学习框架，仅使用1.5K训练样本，在1.5B模型上进行SFT+RL训练，优化token使用效率

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上，SFT+RL模型在不同计算预算下表现更好，准确率更高，token使用量相比SFT模型减少超过40%

Conclusion: 强化学习可以恢复长上下文训练带来的损失，整体提升数学推理性能，特别是在小模型上实现更高的准确率和更好的计算效率

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods have seen a rapid increase in popularity for its
computational efficiency and parameter-independent training to improve
reasoning performance on Large Language Models. One such method is called
budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute
budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the
model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context
reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to
verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating
reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the
performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this
using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed
better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings
showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage
by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses
due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in
mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的符号AI集成到LLMs的分类框架和路线图，旨在解决LLMs透明度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs虽然在学习、生成响应和决策方面表现出色，但缺乏透明度。现有的神经符号AI方法主要针对传统神经网络设计，不适用于LLMs的特性，因此需要系统性地理解如何将符号AI有效集成到LLMs中。

Method: 首先回顾已建立的神经符号AI方法，然后提出LLMs中符号集成的新分类法，包括四个维度：LLM不同阶段的符号集成、耦合机制、架构范式以及算法和应用层面视角。

Result: 开发了一个新的分类框架，组织现有文献到这些类别中，识别了当前基准、前沿进展和关键差距。

Conclusion: 通过突出最新发展和文献中的显著差距，为实施符号集成到LLMs的框架提供了实用见解，以增强透明度，并提出了未来研究的路线图。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response
generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However,
these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in
responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address
transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI
approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are
not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a
limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively
integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing
established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic
integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with
LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four
dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These
include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms,
architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level
perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge
advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for
future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in
the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for
symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.

TL;DR: 提出了AutoOpt-11k数据集和AutoOpt框架，AutoOpt-11k包含11,000多个手写和打印的数学优化模型图像，AutoOpt是一个基于机器学习的自动化优化问题求解框架，包含图像转文本、文本转文本和优化求解三个模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数学优化问题求解过程中需要人工建模和编程的繁琐过程，实现从优化问题图像到最终解的全自动化处理。

Method: 开发了AutoOpt框架，包含三个模块：M1使用深度学习模型进行数学表达式识别生成LaTeX代码；M2使用微调的小型LLM将LaTeX代码转换为PYOMO脚本；M3使用双层优化分解方法求解优化问题。

Result: MER模型在BLEU分数指标上优于ChatGPT、Gemini和Nougat；BOBD方法在复杂测试问题上比内点算法和遗传算法表现更好。

Conclusion: AutoOpt-11k数据集和AutoOpt框架为自动化求解优化问题提供了有效的解决方案，在数学表达式识别和复杂优化问题求解方面都取得了良好性能。

Abstract: This study presents AutoOpt-11k, a unique image dataset of over 11,000
handwritten and printed mathematical optimization models corresponding to
single-objective, multi-objective, multi-level, and stochastic optimization
problems exhibiting various types of complexities such as non-linearity,
non-convexity, non-differentiability, discontinuity, and high-dimensionality.
The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling
language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25
experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases
to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning
based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just
needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently
without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three
Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the
Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code
corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)-
a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling
language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization
based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described
in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of
deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task
(M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method
(M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test
problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and
genetic algorithm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MoSES框架，通过状态可分解MDP和潜在空间扩展，让统一求解器重用基础VRP变体的专门求解器，避免神经网络求解器数量指数增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多任务VRP神经网络方法未能充分利用VRP变体的组合结构，忽略了基础变体专门求解器的潜在优势。

Method: 引入状态可分解MDP(SDMDP)将VRP状态空间表示为基础状态空间的笛卡尔积，开发潜在空间扩展，通过可学习混合函数在潜在空间重用基础策略。

Result: MoSES在多个VRP变体上的实验显示优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效利用VRP变体的组合结构，通过重用基础求解器提升统一求解器性能。

Abstract: Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs)
typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously.
However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants,
each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight
causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers,
each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the
shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis
solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers.
Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates
VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state
spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation
inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant.
Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating
both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the
policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension
provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture
function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state
embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation,
we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes
basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and
implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive
experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES
over prior methods.

TL;DR: EU-Agent-Bench是一个评估LLM代理在欧盟法律背景下合规性的基准测试，通过对比模型函数调用与法律条文来测量代理采取非法行为的倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在各种场景中的部署，它们可能表现出不可预测的行为，包括采取不良和/或不安全的行动。需要测量LLM代理在欧盟立法背景下采取非法行为的潜在倾向。

Method: 创建了一个可验证的人工策划基准，评估代理在良性用户输入可能导致非法行动的情况下与欧盟法律规范的契合度。基准涵盖数据保护、偏见/歧视和科学诚信等多个类别，每个用户请求都允许合规和不合规的执行方式。

Result: 评估了前沿LLM的法律合规性，并研究了在代理系统提示中提供相关法律摘录和明确合规指令的合规效果。

Conclusion: 鼓励未来工作将代理安全基准扩展到不同的法律管辖区以及多轮和多语言交互。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in various
contexts by providing tools at their disposal. However, LLM agents can exhibit
unpredictable behaviors, including taking undesirable and/or unsafe actions. In
order to measure the latent propensity of LLM agents for taking illegal actions
under an EU legislative context, we introduce EU-Agent-Bench, a verifiable
human-curated benchmark that evaluates an agent's alignment with EU legal norms
in situations where benign user inputs could lead to unlawful actions. Our
benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection,
bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing
for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions.
Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by
citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of
frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing
the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with
explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the
research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data
contamination in evaluating upcoming models. We encourage future work extending
agentic safety benchmarks to different legal jurisdictions and to multi-turn
and multilingual interactions. We release our code on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM智能体长程推理失败的主要原因是中间推理验证不足，而非生成能力问题。

Method: 使用CAMV将验证重构为冲突识别和针对性证伪，只对专家智能体间的不一致热点分配计算资源；TRSF通过结构化事实模块持续组织、验证和同步证据。

Result: 在GAIA上达到84.4%准确率，Humanity's Last Exam上35.5%，Chinese-SimpleQA上93.8%，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Co-Sight为LLM智能体提供了可扩展的可靠长程推理范式，结构化事实基础和冲突感知验证的协同作用是性能提升的关键。

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative
weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight
addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable
process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification
(CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV
reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted
falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among
expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification
cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.
TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents
through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and
auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent,
source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout
the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop,
where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or
reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically,
Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last
Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies
confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and
conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a
scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用模仿学习训练神经控制屏障函数的方法，无需明确指定失败状态集合，仅通过专家演示数据就能学习安全约束，在四个环境中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在关键领域运行的自主系统需要确保安全性，但失败状态集合往往难以明确定义（如自动驾驶中的跟车问题），而生成专家演示数据相对容易。

Method: 使用模仿学习训练约束函数来分类系统状态为安全或不安全，然后用该函数标注新的模拟轨迹来训练神经控制屏障函数。

Result: 在四个不同环境中的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线，且与使用真实安全标签训练的神经控制屏障函数性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数据驱动的安全约束学习方法，无需明确指定失败状态集合，仅通过专家演示就能有效学习安全策略。

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.

Motivation: 现有代码代理的自我改进方法主要依赖软件工程基准性能，但作者发现代理的自我改进潜力与基准性能之间存在不匹配问题，需要更有效的指标来指导自我改进过程。

Method: 提出CMP指标来评估代理的自我改进潜力，并基于此构建Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM)框架，通过估计CMP来指导自我修改树的搜索过程。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified和Polyglot基准测试中，HGM方法优于现有自我改进代码代理开发方法，同时使用更少的计算时间，并在其他代码数据集和大型语言模型上表现出良好的迁移性。

Conclusion: HGM方法通过准确估计自我改进潜力，有效解决了性能与改进潜力之间的不匹配问题，实现了人类水平的代码代理性能，为自我改进系统的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that
edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through
expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark
performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent
self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's
self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark
performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by
Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates
the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of
its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding
agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to
simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We
introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$
and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench
Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent
development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM
demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language
models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and
evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance,
matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

TL;DR: AstaBench是一个用于严格评估AI科学代理的基准套件，包含2400多个科学发现问题，提供可复现的工具环境和全面的基线代理，评估显示AI在科学研究辅助方面仍有很大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理评估基准存在多方面不足：无法提供真实科学研究的整体衡量、缺乏可复现的工具、未考虑模型成本和工具访问等混杂变量、缺少标准化接口、缺乏全面基线代理。

Method: 提出AstaBench基准套件，包含2400+个涵盖整个科学发现过程的问题，提供生产级搜索工具的科学研究环境，包含9类科学优化代理和众多基线代理。

Result: 对57个代理在22个代理类别上的广泛评估显示，尽管在某些具体方面有进展，但AI在解决科学研究辅助挑战方面仍有很大差距。

Conclusion: 需要更严格的AI代理基准来推动科学AI代理的发展，AstaBench为此提供了首个全面的科学代理评估框架。

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

*Marta Contreiras Silva,Daniel Faria,Catia Pesquita*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CMOMgen是首个端到端的复杂多本体匹配策略，能够生成完整且语义合理的映射，无需对目标本体或实体数量设限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建全面的知识图谱需要使用多个本体来完整地将数据置于领域上下文中。简单的成对等价映射无法提供相关但不相交本体的完整语义集成。

Method: 采用检索增强生成方法选择相关类来组成映射，并过滤匹配参考映射作为示例来增强上下文学习。

Result: 在三个生物医学任务中，CMOMgen在类选择方面优于基线方法，F1分数至少达到63%，在两个任务中优于所有基线和消融版本，在第三个任务中排名第二。手动评估显示46%的映射获得最高分。

Conclusion: CMOMgen能够构建语义合理的映射，在复杂多本体匹配任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs requires the use of multiple
ontologies in order to fully contextualize data into a domain. Ontology
matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and
creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art
is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic
integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching
(CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple
target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along
the ontological hierarchy.
  We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates
complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions
on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference
mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was
evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen
outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a
dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score,
outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and
placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference
mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further
substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态框架分析基准数据集，包含专家标注的Facebook和YouTube视频广告，涵盖13种框架类型、50多家公司和20个国家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业公关活动存在言行不一的问题（如石油公司的"漂绿"现象），需要大规模理解框架及其变化来揭示公关活动的目标和本质。

Method: 构建专家标注的视频广告数据集，专门用于评估视觉语言模型，区别于以往的纯文本框架数据集。

Result: 基线实验显示GPT-4.1能检测环境信息（79% F1分数），但最佳模型在识别绿色创新框架方面仅达到46% F1分数。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于能源领域战略沟通的多模态分析研究，同时指出了视觉语言模型需要解决的挑战，如隐含框架、不同长度视频处理和文化背景理解。

Abstract: Companies spend large amounts of money on public relations campaigns to
project a positive brand image. However, sometimes there is a mismatch between
what they say and what they do. Oil & gas companies, for example, are accused
of "greenwashing" with imagery of climate-friendly initiatives. Understanding
the framing, and changes in framing, at scale can help better understand the
goals and nature of public relations campaigns. To address this, we introduce a
benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and
YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50
companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially
designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it
from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising
results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect
environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves
46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify
challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of
various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds. Our dataset contributes to
research in multimodal analysis of strategic communication in the energy
sector.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主代理在动态环境中协调时，高层任务目标与低层规划器输入之间的语义鸿沟问题。

Method: 采用双平面架构的知识图谱，将声明性事实编译为每个代理的任务感知"世界观"和物理感知遍历规则，使任务语义与领域无关的规划器解耦。

Result: 通过墨西哥湾自主水下航行器的案例研究，可视化展示了端到端过程，并定量证明不同声明性策略能产生独特且高性能的结果。

Conclusion: 知识图谱不仅是数据存储库，更是创建自适应和可解释自主系统的强大状态协调器。

Abstract: The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by
the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner
inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph
(KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane
architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware
``worldviews" and physics-aware traversal rules, decoupling mission semantics
from a domain-agnostic planner. This allows complex, coordinated paths to be
modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous
Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the
end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative
policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes. This work establishes the
KG not merely as a data repository, but as a powerful, stateful orchestrator
for creating adaptive and explainable autonomous systems.

TL;DR: CESAR通过在线强化学习框架解决音频大语言模型中的推理反缩放问题，通过奖励推理过程而非结果验证，在MMAU Test-mini上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大语言模型中的推理过程往往导致性能下降（测试时反缩放现象），这源于缺乏对推理过程的适当训练指导。

Method: 使用在线强化学习框架，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization和多方面奖励机制，激励正确性、格式、一致性、结构化分析模式、因果推理、领域知识整合和校准推理深度。

Result: 解决了测试时反缩放问题，在MMAU Test-mini上大幅超越Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-4o Audio，在MMSU推理任务上接近人类水平。

Conclusion: CESAR为音频大语言模型开发稳健可扩展的推理能力建立了原则性方法，增强的推理能力还能协同改善多模态推理和感知能力。

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

TL;DR: CRISP是一个基于图时空学习的金融预测框架，通过自适应图注意力机制发现危机相关的资产依赖关系，在通胀驱动市场等不同危机机制下保持稳健预测性能，实现707%的夏普比率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图的时空学习方法依赖预定义图拓扑结构，无法适应市场动态在不同危机机制（信用传染、疫情冲击、通胀抛售）下的变化，需要能够自适应发现危机相关资产关系的框架。

Method: 使用图卷积网络编码空间关系，BiLSTM与自注意力机制建模时序动态，通过多头图注意力网络学习稀疏结构，过滤92.5%的噪声连接，保留危机相关的依赖关系。

Result: 在2005-2021年数据训练后，在2022-2024年通胀驱动市场的全新机制下仍能准确预测机制相关的相关性结构，夏普比率达到3.76，比等权重基准提升707%，比静态图方法提升94%。

Conclusion: CRISP通过学习预测而非强加假设，实现了对危机机制的稳健泛化，注意力权重提供了可解释的机制检测，防御性集群注意力在危机期间增强49%（市场整体为31%）。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

Conclusion: MOBO-OSD是有效的多目标贝叶斯优化方法，能够生成高质量、多样化的帕累托最优解集。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

Abstract: Landslides are a growing climate induced hazard with severe environmental and
human consequences, particularly in high mountain Asia. Despite increasing
access to satellite and temporal datasets, timely detection and disaster

Motivation: 传统多模态学习方法强制弱模态与主导模态对齐，这会抑制弱模态的独特信息。需要一种新方法来保护弱模态的特定信息。

Method: 提出了多模态负学习框架，通过主导模态动态引导弱模态抑制非目标类别，稳定决策空间并保留模态特定信息。

Result: 实验证明该方法在多个基准测试中有效，特别是在噪声和不平衡场景下减少了弱模态的实证误差，提高了多模态学习的鲁棒性下界。

Conclusion: 负学习范式能够有效解决模态不平衡问题，保护弱模态的独特信息，提高多模态学习系统的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG虽然能提高模型输出准确性，但引入外部知识库会导致长上下文处理挑战，显著增加内存消耗和推理延迟。现有方法通过预计算KV来加速推理，但仍有优化空间。

Method: 1. 基于KV块访问频率的热感知混合精度压缩和加载方法；2. 热感知数据放置策略，将高频访问KV块优先存储在高速内存中。

Conclusion: HA-RAG系统有效解决了RAG推理中的性能瓶颈，通过热感知优化策略显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: 重尾SGD结合梯度裁剪能够找到几何形状更平坦的局部最小值，并实现更好的泛化性能，理论和实验均证实了这一预测。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，所提出的方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的区间目标回归方法有效解决了精确标签不可得的问题，通过兼容损失函数和最小-最大学习公式实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for

*Sungjun Cho,Changho Shin,Suenggwan Jo,Xinya Yan,Shourjo Aditya Chaudhuri,Frederic Sala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LBS框架，结合状态空间模型和大型语言模型，实现多模态时间序列预测，支持灵活的时间窗口和不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在整合结构化时间序列数据和非结构化文本信息方面存在架构限制，无法建模或量化不确定性。

Method: 使用状态空间模型捕捉潜在状态的时间动态，结合预训练LLM编码文本输入进行后验状态估计和解码文本预测。

Result: 在TextTimeCorpus基准测试中，LBS将先前最先进方法的性能提升了13.20%，并提供人类可读的预测摘要。

Conclusion: 这是首个统一LLM和SSM进行联合数值和文本预测的工作，为多模态时间推理提供了新基础。

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

*Jeff Pflueger,Michael Everett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用可逆性来防止训练过程中安全问题的强化学习方法，通过模型预测路径积分控制检查学习策略提出的动作安全性，无需显式了解动态或安全约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无模型强化学习缺乏正式安全保证，现有方法通常需要详细了解安全规范。许多难以规范的安全问题最好通过不变性来表征，因此利用可逆性来防止这些安全问题。

Method: 使用模型预测路径积分控制检查学习策略提出的动作安全性，只需能够查询黑盒动态，无需显式了解动态或安全约束。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提算法在所有不安全动作发生前成功中止，同时达到与允许违反安全的基线PPO方法相当的训练进度。

Conclusion: 基于可逆性的方法能够有效防止强化学习训练过程中的安全问题，仅需查询黑盒动态即可实现安全保证。

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统跌倒检测系统在泛化性、数据隐私和个体行为差异方面的局限性，需要开发更鲁棒、准确且保护隐私的检测方案。

Method: 使用集成惩罚联邦学习框架，结合持续学习、个性化建模和专门加权聚合策略，利用可穿戴传感器数据，通过同态加密和联邦训练保护用户隐私。

Result: 在基准跌倒检测数据集上实现88.31%的召回率和89.94%的F1分数，显著优于集中式和基线模型。

Conclusion: EPFL为医疗环境中的跌倒检测提供了一个可扩展、安全且准确的解决方案，具有通过自适应反馈机制持续改进的潜力。

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的协作式多智能体辩论协议ColMAD，将辩论重新定义为非零和博弈，通过鼓励智能体以支持性方式相互批评来提升错误检测能力，相比之前的竞争性MAD方法提升了19%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体辩论方法将辩论视为零和博弈，导致辩论者为了获胜而误导法官，反而引入更多错误。需要一种协作式方法来真正寻求真相而非竞争胜利。

Method: 提出ColMAD协议，将多智能体辩论重构为非零和博弈，鼓励智能体以支持性方式相互批评，补充彼此遗漏的观点，为法官提供更全面的证据。

Result: 实验表明ColMAD显著优于之前的竞争性MAD方法19%，并在错误检测任务上相比单智能体方法带来了实质性改进。

Conclusion: 协作式多智能体辩论协议ColMAD通过非零和博弈框架有效缓解了辩论黑客问题，在大语言模型错误检测方面取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Accurate detection of errors in large language models (LLM) responses is
central to the success of scalable oversight, or providing effective
supervision to superhuman intelligence. Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable
on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate
(MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs
provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于向量copula理论的互信息估计方法，在复杂神经网络模型和简化高斯模型之间实现更好的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有互信息估计方法存在两极分化：要么依赖需要大量数据的复杂神经网络模型，要么使用无法捕捉复杂分布的过度简化模型，需要找到更好的折中方案

Method: 基于向量copula理论，在复杂神经网络模型和简化高斯copula模型之间进行原则性插值，实现复杂度与容量的更好权衡

Result: 在先进合成基准测试和包含多种模态的真实世界数据上的实验证明了所提出估计器的优势

Conclusion: 基于向量copula的互信息估计方法在复杂性和容量之间实现了更好的平衡，在多种场景下表现出优越性能

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了隐式神经表示(INRs)在血流动力学场压缩和心血管解剖表示中的性能，展示了高达230倍的压缩比和毫米级的解剖精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INRs)作为一种新兴的知识表示框架，具有分辨率独立性和高内存效率，但其在特定领域应用中的准确性尚未得到充分理解，特别是在血流动力学和心血管解剖学领域。

Method: 研究了多种缓解频谱偏差的策略，包括专用激活函数、固定和可训练位置编码、非线性核的线性组合，并在胸主动脉的血流动力学场和心血管解剖学上进行了测试。

Result: 在胸主动脉的血流动力学场中，INRs实现了约230倍的压缩比，压力最大绝对误差为1 mmHg，速度误差为5-10 cm/s；在48个胸主动脉解剖结构中，平均和最大绝对解剖差异分别低于0.5 mm和1.6 mm。

Conclusion: SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE架构表现最佳，证明了INRs在医学图像压缩和表示中的有效性。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

TL;DR: L2M3OF是首个用于金属有机框架(MOFs)的多模态大语言模型，通过整合晶体结构表示学习和语言理解，在性能预测和知识生成任务中超越了仅基于文本的闭源LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但在科学发现领域突破有限，因为理解复杂物理现象需要超越语言的多元表示。MOF设计尤其依赖难以用文本编码的人类专业知识。

Method: L2M3OF整合了预训练的晶体编码器和轻量级投影层，将结构信息压缩到标记空间，实现与语言指令的高效对齐。构建了结构-属性-知识数据库进行训练和评估。

Result: 实验显示L2M3OF在性能预测和知识生成任务中超越了GPT-5、Gemini-2.5-Pro和DeepSeek-R1等最先进的闭源LLMs，且参数数量更少。

Conclusion: 多模态方法对于多孔材料理解至关重要，L2M3OF为下一代材料发现AI系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

Motivation: 设备端神经网络训练面临严重的内存限制，这限制了预训练模型在下游任务上的适应能力。

Method: 提出LaRa（层排序）改进的层重要性度量方法，以及利用通道重要性分布时间稳定性的动态通道采样策略，在训练过程中根据重要性加权概率动态重采样通道。

Result: 在大量任务和架构上的广泛评估表明，MeDyate在极端内存约束下实现了最先进的性能，始终优于现有的静态和动态方法，同时保持高计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过展示在仅几百kB RAM内存预算下的有效微调，朝着实现高效设备端学习迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理需要大量计算资源和内存，标准均匀量化在低比特场景下会导致显著性能下降，需要更有效的量化方法来平衡模型大小和精度。

Method: 采用分组格向量量化框架，每组权重使用由可学习生成矩阵定义的定制化格码本，使用Babai舍入法近似最近格点搜索来解决量化过程的不可微问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法相比现有后训练量化基线实现了更好的模型大小与精度权衡，特别适合在严格资源约束下部署大模型。

Conclusion: GLVQ框架提供了一种高效实用的量化流程，解码过程简化为简单的矩阵向量乘法，在保持推理效率的同时显著提升了低比特量化的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained

settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove
convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架能够训练高效稀疏的SNN，在多种时间序列分类任务中表现出色，特别适合低功耗边缘设备部署，展示了脉冲神经网络在资源受限场景下的优势。

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

Motivation: 现有的图像自回归模型生成速度慢，需要大量采样步骤。虽然DD1实现了少步采样，但在一步采样时性能下降明显且依赖预定义映射，限制了灵活性

Method: 将原始AR模型视为教师模型，在潜在嵌入空间中提供条件分数。提出条件分数蒸馏损失来训练一步生成器，训练单独网络预测生成分布的条件分数

Result: 在ImageNet-256上，DD2实现一步采样，FID从3.40仅增加到5.43。相比DD1基线，一步采样与原始AR模型的差距减少67%，训练速度提升12.3倍

Conclusion: DD2在实现一步AR生成方面迈出重要一步，为快速高质量的自回归建模开辟了新可能性

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations

prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

*Wanhao Yu,Zheng Wang,Shuteng Niu,Sen Lin,Li Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究零阶优化在持续学习中的应用，发现其能通过平坦化损失景观来减少遗忘，但会降低学习新任务的能力，并提出ZO-FC方法平衡稳定性和可塑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索零阶优化作为解决持续学习中稳定性-可塑性-效率三难问题的新方法，特别是在梯度计算昂贵或不切实际的场景下。

Method: 提出ZO-FC方法，将零阶优化应用于单个基于适配器的PEFT模块，同时使用一阶优化训练分类器，以平衡稳定性和可塑性。

Result: 实验表明ZO-FC在稳定性和可塑性之间达到有效平衡，为设备端持续学习提供了实用且内存高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 零阶优化能增强持续学习的稳定性但会削弱可塑性，而ZO-FC方法通过混合优化策略成功解决了这一权衡问题。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了梯度学习算法中学习率对样本复杂度的影响，揭示了从信息指数机制到生成指数机制的相变现象，并提出了新的分层训练算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经网络中特征学习的动态过程，特别是在高斯单索引模型中，现有研究表明在线SGD的样本复杂度由链接函数的信息指数决定，而通过重用样本可以改善到生成指数限制。但这一结论只在学习率足够大时成立，需要系统研究学习率与样本复杂度的关系。

Method: 提出了一个统一的梯度学习算法框架，涵盖相关性和非相关性更新。引入新的分层训练算法，采用双时间尺度方法（每层使用不同学习率），在不重用样本或修改平方误差损失的情况下超越相关性查询。

Result: 发现在某些情况下存在从"信息指数机制"（小学习率）到"生成指数机制"（大学习率）的相变。分层训练算法能够在不重用样本的情况下实现更好的统计效率。

Conclusion: 学习率的选择与算法设计同等重要，对实现统计和计算效率至关重要。该研究为理解梯度学习动态提供了更全面的理论框架。

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain
scientists, and these annotations are propagated across clusters to yield
systematic, scalable classifications. We evaluate CIPHER on the task of
classifying solar wind phenomena in OMNI data, a central challenge in space
weather research, showing that the framework recovers meaningful phenomena such
as coronal mass ejections and stream interaction regions. Beyond this case
study, CIPHER highlights a general strategy for combining symbolic
representations, unsupervised learning, and expert knowledge to address label
scarcity in time series across the physical sciences. The code and
configuration files used in this study are publicly available to support
reproducibility.

Motivation: 现有机器学习方法往往忽略物理定律且无法量化时空预测中的不确定性，需要开发能同时保证物理一致性和不确定性量化的方法。

Method: PCNO通过物理一致性投影层在傅里叶空间强制质量动量守恒；DiffPCNO在PCNO基础上结合一致性模型来量化和减轻不确定性。

Result: PCNO和DiffPCNO在从湍流建模到真实洪水/大气预测的多种系统和空间分辨率下，实现了高保真时空预测，同时保持物理一致性和不确定性。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段框架为准确、物理基础和不确定性感知的时空预测提供了稳健且通用的方法。

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑机接口基准主要针对简单的基础任务，而实际应用任务如脑到文本转换仍然难以实现，需要找到既实用又保护隐私的中间任务。

Method: 使用52小时的LibriBrain语料库，采用针对极端类别不平衡的评估协议，使用AUPRC和每小时误报率作为评估指标，提出基于1-D Conv/ResNet的紧凑基线模型，结合焦点损失和top-k池化。

Result: 参考模型在保持会话上达到置换基线AUPRC的13倍性能，发现性能随训练时间对数线性提升，词频和持续时间等词级因素系统性影响可检测性。

Conclusion: 关键词检测是脑机接口可行的实用中间任务，提供了可复现的基准和社区工具，为实际应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统多目标优化方法在在线设置中样本效率低、难以灵活融入用户偏好以及需要显式计算超体积的问题。

Method: 使用类别概率估计器预测非支配关系，通过偏好方向向量编码用户偏好，构建能够条件生成帕累托集的生成模型。

Result: 在合成基准和蛋白质设计任务中表现出强样本效率和有效的偏好融入能力，获得高质量的帕累托集近似。

Conclusion: A-GPS是一个简单而强大的方法，避免了显式超体积计算，能够灵活捕捉用户偏好，在多目标优化中表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文献中的两个关键限制：缺乏无损舍入方案来保证积分算法与分数解的性能等价，以及处理属于多个类别的代理带来的挑战。

Method: 基于松弛-舍入框架的随机算法，首先使用资源预留机制（set-aside机制）计算分数解来强制执行类别间公平性，然后通过无损舍入步骤保持公平性而不降低性能。还提出了结合机器学习预测的学习增强变体。

Result: 算法能够确保积分算法达到与任何分数解相同的期望性能，同时保持跨类别的公平性保证。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了在线多类选择中的公平分配问题，特别是针对多类别代理的挑战，并通过学习增强变体在实际设置中更好地平衡公平性和效率。

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

Conclusion: 研究为隐私保护策略优化算法提供了有价值的实践洞见，证明了在适当设计下，隐私保护不会显著增加策略优化的样本复杂度。

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the
quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset
(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed
and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and
mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach
offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring
complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale
in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made
publicly available to advance future studies of solar wind dynamics and space
weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Conclusion: 神经崩溃不仅出现在无约束特征优化中，在考虑数据结构和非线性激活的实际网络训练中也会自然出现，训练动态的隐式偏置是促进NC出现的关键因素。

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

Conclusion: 该方法能快速选择CPU-GPU协同执行策略，显著降低移动设备上的神经网络推理延迟，接近理论最优性能。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available
at https://github.com/UCF-ML-Research/DictPFL.

Conclusion: 将全局基序知识与细粒度局部上下文整合，能够有效推进稳健的少样本分子性质预测。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

*Yunuo Zhang,Baiting Luo,Ayan Mukhopadhyay,Gabor Karsai,Abhishek Dubey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ESCORT是一个基于粒子的框架，用于在高维信念空间中捕捉复杂多模态分布，通过相关感知投影和时间一致性约束改进SVGD方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着环境变得更加真实，信念分布变得复杂，标准数学模型无法准确捕捉，现有POMDP信念近似方法无法准确表示复杂的多模态信念分布，导致估计错误和次优行为。

Method: 扩展SVGD方法，引入相关感知投影来建模状态维度间的依赖关系，以及时间一致性约束来稳定更新同时保持相关结构。

Result: 在POMDP领域和合成多模态分布上的广泛评估表明，ESCORT在信念近似精度和下游决策质量方面始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: ESCORT能够动态适应信念景观复杂性，无需重采样或限制性分布假设，有效解决了复杂信念分布的表示挑战。

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于连续松弛和加噪机制的特征选择方法，能够在多子群体场景下平衡下游模型性能，无需通过模型训练过程进行反向传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特征收集成本高昂的背景下，需要选择有限特征来训练能够同时在多个子群体上表现良好的模型。

Method: 将特征选择问题建模为传统变量选择的连续松弛，使用加噪机制，通过优化贝叶斯最优预测器的方差来开发模型无关的框架。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实世界数据上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够平衡不同群体间的下游预测性能，为成本敏感的特征选择问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

TL;DR: SolarBoost是一种用于分布式光伏系统功率输出预测的新方法，通过将聚合功率输出建模为小电网输出的组合，解决了分布式光伏系统面临的电网级数据缺失、容量动态变化等挑战。

Conclusion: SolarBoost通过创新的电网级建模方法，有效解决了分布式光伏系统功率预测的挑战，在真实部署中表现出色，为分布式光伏的集成和管理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

Motivation: 医疗物联网对顺序医疗工作流有严格的端到端延迟要求，而调度这些工作流以最小化完工时间是一个NP难问题。

Method: 采用分层调度决策：全局控制器执行层选择（边缘、雾或云），专门的本地控制器处理选定层内的节点分配。

Result: 实验结果表明，随着工作流复杂度的增加，该框架相对于基线方法的性能优势更加明显。

Conclusion: 该框架能够学习有效的长期策略，这对于复杂、大规模的医疗物联网调度场景至关重要。

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

Conclusion: 该框架为聚类分析提供了统一的数学基础，鲁棒变体增强了方法的实用性，理论收敛性保证了算法的可靠性。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

Motivation: 标准RL方法优化平均奖励，而专注于减少不良输出概率的方法通常会牺牲平均性能。需要改进这种权衡关系。

Method: 在标准RL损失基础上增加额外损失，使用学习到的建议来指导采样低奖励输出，然后降低这些输出的概率。

Result: 实验表明RePULSe在期望奖励与不良输出概率之间实现了更好的权衡，并且具有更强的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RePULSe相比标准RL对齐方法和替代方案，能够更好地平衡期望奖励和减少不良输出的目标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

Conclusion: PLAN通过主动管理任务特定子空间和干扰最小化机制，有效解决了持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，同时保持了高效适应新任务的能力。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

Conclusion: 通过引入二阶统计量的新范式，成功解决了AUC优化中的关键挑战，为大规模不平衡分类问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将物理语义嵌入生成流的方法，通过约束流匹配模型的每一步都从已知物理分布中采样，使中间生成步骤具有可解释性。

Method: 提出通用框架，将流轨迹映射到模拟物理过程的平衡状态。通过2D Ising模型实现，使流步骤成为参数化冷却计划中的热平衡点。架构包括编码器、流匹配网络和投影器。

Result: 在多种晶格尺寸上验证了该框架，在保持物理保真度的同时，随着晶格尺寸增加，生成速度超过蒙特卡洛方法。与标准流匹配相比，每个向量场表示2D Ising模型潜在空间中有意义的逐步转换。

Conclusion: 将物理语义嵌入生成流可以将不透明的神经轨迹转化为可解释的物理过程，为生成模型提供可解释性。

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Result: 实验证明FDAs在模型合并中有效，且与参数空间模型合并方法互补。

Conclusion: FDAs框架为多任务联合训练和后验合并提供了桥梁，提供了鲁棒性和灵活性。

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

Result: 实证研究表明，可实现的混淆程度与近似模型中的不确定性相关。

Conclusion: 这种混淆程度可能为深度基于模型的强化学习提供理论基础的探索策略信息。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

Conclusion: 理论结果在回归设置中得到了数值实验的验证，证明了SGLD在惰性训练机制下的有效收敛性能。

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression
setting.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling
across various scientific and industrial applications. Owing to their
versatility, numerous RNN variants have been proposed over the past decade,
aiming to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies and to address

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图注意力在全局交互学习中面临过聚合问题，即大量消息不加区分地聚合到单个节点，导致关键信息被稀释和丢失。

Method: 将节点聚合划分为并行过程，引导模型关注特定子集，限制每次聚合的输入量；通过排序和加权聚合输出，优先处理信息量大的消息。

Result: 评估显示Wideformer能有效缓解过聚合问题，使骨干方法能专注于信息量大的消息，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Wideformer通过并行聚合和引导机制成功解决了图注意力中的过聚合问题，提高了模型性能。

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

TL;DR: 提出基于Buffer层的新TTA范式，解决传统归一化层更新的局限性，保持预训练主干完整性，提升领域适应性能和抗遗忘能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法依赖归一化层更新，但存在小批量敏感、依赖预训练统计量、受限于模型结构等问题，限制了在显著领域偏移下的效果。

Method: 引入Buffer层概念，不修改模型核心参数，保持预训练主干完整性，可无缝集成到现有TTA框架中。

Result: 在缓解领域偏移和增强模型鲁棒性方面优于传统方法，表现出强大的抗遗忘能力，在各种架构上实现一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: Buffer层方法有效且通用，适用于实际领域适应场景，代码已开源。

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决真实世界传感器噪声条件下的人类活动识别问题，通过训练时模拟测试时的噪声模式来提高模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用PatchTST变换器架构，为四个惯性传感器位置分别训练独立模型，采用1秒滑动窗口和随机抖动、缩放、旋转、通道丢失等数据增强技术，最后通过软概率平均进行模型集成。

Result: 在私有排行榜上取得了显著高于基线的宏F1分数，证明了该方法在噪声条件下的有效性。

Conclusion: 测试匹配的数据增强结合基于变换器的集成是噪声条件下鲁棒人类活动识别的有效策略。

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个分析自适应优化器（如Adam和Muon）在浮点量化下的收敛性理论框架，揭示了低精度训练保持有效性的理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速扩展，低精度训练对于减少内存、提高效率至关重要，但现有收敛理论忽略了硬件感知量化，无法解释低精度训练为何有效。

Method: 建立了包含梯度、权重和优化器状态浮点量化的理论框架，在平滑非凸目标下推导收敛速率，明确量化不同组件的量化误差对收敛的影响。

Result: 分析表明，只要尾数长度随迭代次数对数增长，两种算法都能保持接近全精度版本的收敛速率。Adam对权重和第二矩量化高度敏感，而Muon需要更弱的误差控制，可能更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该研究缩小了低精度训练方法的实证成功与理论理解之间的差距，数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

Conclusion: 这是首个对神经网络进行分层数据评估的系统性方法，为大规模机器学习系统提供了理论保证和实际优势。

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

Conclusion: RAVEN能有效解决弱到强泛化在分布偏移下的挑战，自动分配更高权重给更准确的弱模型，实现鲁棒的弱监督学习。

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了广义可加模型(GAMs)解释生成的计算复杂性，发现在不同输入空间结构、组件模型类型、回归与分类任务以及不同解释方法下，GAMs的解释复杂性呈现出多样化的正负结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然GAMs通常被认为具有可解释性，但作者质疑为其生成有意义的解释是否总是计算可行的，因此系统分析了GAMs解释生成的计算复杂性。

Method: 通过计算复杂性理论分析，在标准复杂性假设(P!=NP)下，研究了不同形式的GAMs在各种上下文中的解释生成复杂性。

Result: 发现：(1)GAMs解释复杂性受输入空间结构影响；(2)组件模型类型差异只在特定输入域下显现；(3)回归与分类任务的解释复杂性存在显著差异；(4)神经网络表达为可加形式仅在特定解释方法和输入域下更易解释。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GAMs解释计算可行性的严格理论条件，明确了在何种情况下这些计算是可能的或已被证明是困难的。

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models

most widely used approaches are reparameterization methods, which update a
target module by augmenting its frozen weight matrix with an additional
trainable weight matrix. The most prominent example is Low Rank Adaption
(LoRA), which gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we
introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary
classification setting using tools from Random Matrix Theory, and further
validate our theoretical findings through more realistic experiments, such as
fine-tuning LLMs.

Result: 在8个视觉异常检测数据集、26个表格异常检测数据集和1个真实工业数据集上验证了有效性。消融研究分析了超参数影响和对不同污染水平的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EPHAD在不同异常检测模型和证据对中展现出多功能性和鲁棒性，为解决训练数据污染问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

Conclusion: 该方法成功将深度学习的表达能力与概率建模的严谨性相结合，为部分标签学习提供了高效且理论严谨的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在生物医学信号解读中表现出色，但临床实践中需要确定何时以及为何信任算法推荐，这需要研究AI辅助的类型和时机对临床决策的影响。

Method: 对8名专业睡眠医学从业者进行应用导向的用户研究，在三种条件下评分夜间唤醒事件：手动评分、黑盒AI辅助和透明白盒AI辅助，辅助时机分为起始辅助和质量控制审查。

Result: AI和人类-AI团队均显著优于未辅助专家，透明AI辅助作为质量控制步骤比黑盒辅助提升约30%的事件级性能，质量控制时机进一步改善计数结果。透明AI虽增加评分时间，但获得7/8参与者的采纳意愿。

Conclusion: 策略性定时的透明AI辅助有效平衡了准确性和临床效率，为可信AI集成和用户接受提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过初始均匀探索和标准UCB算法来最小化Nash遗憾的方法，该方法仅依赖加法Hoeffding界，适用于子高斯奖励分布，并推广到p-均值遗憾的公平性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统随机多臂老虎机的遗憾度量未能解决奖励分配的公平性问题，特别是在临床实验等需要公平分配奖励的场景中。Nash遗憾通过几何平均奖励来评估性能，符合公平性公理。

Method: 采用初始均匀探索阶段后接标准上置信界(UCB)算法，仅依赖加法Hoeffding界，可扩展到子高斯奖励分布，并推广到p-均值遗憾的公平性度量。

Result: 该方法实现了近乎最优的Nash遗憾，并在所有p值上统一证明了(近乎)最优的遗憾界，相比现有方法放宽了假设条件。

Conclusion: 简单的初始均匀探索加标准UCB算法可以有效解决公平性遗憾最小化问题，无需专门算法设计和强假设条件，具有更好的通用性和最优性。

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

Method: 基于大语言模型的上下文学习，采用认知神经科学关联学习范式，研究六个模型中表征的演化过程。

Result: 发现与词汇重叠相关的词汇干扰会调节表征分化，词汇干扰越高，分化越强，表明表征变化受项目相似性和全局竞争影响。

Conclusion: 大语言模型不仅是研究类人学习系统表征动态的强大工具，也是生成关于大脑记忆重组原理新假设的可访问通用计算模型。

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

TL;DR: SANI是一种语言模型遗忘方法，通过擦除和修复两阶段来消除模型对敏感信息的记忆，无需昂贵的额外微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在特定任务微调时会记忆敏感数据，存在隐私泄露风险，需要一种低成本的方法来消除这种记忆。

Method: 采用擦除阶段重置模型最后层的特定神经元来破坏细粒度信息记忆，然后通过修复阶段微调模型避免记忆敏感信息。

Result: 仅需少量遗忘轮次即可显著减少模型对敏感信息的复现，成功消除了医疗数据中的直接和间接标识符记忆。

Conclusion: SANI为医院等行业提供了一种实用的模型净化方案，可以在共享模型前有效保护敏感信息。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Result: 在合成2D分布和高维φ⁴晶格场理论分布上验证了有效性，即使训练集较小也能保持高性能

Conclusion: ScoreNF提供了一种减少对计算昂贵MCMC训练数据依赖的有效采样方法

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

Result: 该方法计算高效，能够生成保留完整相关结构的合成数据。

Conclusion: GCM为合成数据生成提供了新方法，在隐私保护数据共享、鲁棒模型训练和仿真等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEEDEE是一个用于强化学习时间序列的OOD检测器，使用两个统计量（episodewise均值和RBF核相似度）来捕捉全局和局部偏差，计算效率比现有方法高600倍，准确率平均提升5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键环境中部署强化学习面临分布偏移下的脆弱性问题，需要开发高效的OOD检测方法。

Method: 使用两个统计量：episodewise均值和RBF核相似度到训练摘要，捕捉互补的全局和局部偏差，采用轻量级替代方案。

Result: 在标准RL OOD测试套件中，DEEDEE匹配或超越当代检测器，计算量减少600倍，准确率平均提升5%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，多样异常类型通常通过少量低阶统计量在RL轨迹中留下印记，为复杂环境中的OOD检测提供了紧凑基础。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机神经网络和前向正则化的在线任务无关类增量学习框架，通过集成深度随机向量函数链接网络和贝叶斯自适应调整，有效解决非独立同分布数据流中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类增量学习中的两个关键问题：(1) 在线任务无关场景下的非独立同分布数据流和缺乏边界提示；(2) 长任务流学习中的记忆丢失问题。

Method: 提出随机神经网络前向正则化框架，开发了edRVFL-kF算法实现单次闭式增量更新和可变学习率，并通过贝叶斯自适应改进为edRVFL-kF-Bayes来自适应调整正则化强度。

Result: 在2个图像数据集上的6个指标测试显示，该方法在动态性能、消融测试和兼容性方面均表现出色，有效避免了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 提出的OTCIL框架通过前向正则化和贝叶斯自适应机制，在在线任务无关类增量学习场景中实现了高效决策和低累积遗憾，显著优于传统方法。

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Motivation: 解决用户希望在预期性能改进不令人满意时能够提前停止超参数优化过程的问题，特别是在计算成本与性能提升之间需要权衡的场景。

Method: 在冻结-解冻框架中引入效用函数，结合新颖的采集函数和停止准则，动态选择最有潜力的配置继续训练，并自动在效用最大时停止优化过程。同时通过迁移学习提高样本效率。

Conclusion: 提出的成本敏感超参数优化方法能够有效平衡计算成本与模型性能，在保持竞争力的同时显著提高优化效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

Motivation: 传统扩散方法依赖预训练模型，需要大量干净数据训练。自扩散旨在开发自包含的迭代过程，不依赖外部预训练模型，提高灵活性和适应性。

Method: 自扩散框架包含交替的加噪和去噪步骤：对当前估计加噪，然后使用随机初始化的卷积网络通过数据保真度损失训练自去噪器，利用神经网络的光谱偏置和调度噪声过程。

Result: 在线性逆问题上，自扩散方法取得了与其他方法相当或更优的性能，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 自扩散提供了一种不依赖预训练模型的灵活逆问题解决方法，适应任意前向算子和噪声观测，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于物理信息的极限学习机(PIELM)方法，用于解决逆Stefan问题，相比传统PINNs方法，在精度和训练效率上都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在解决Stefan问题时存在超参数依赖性强、训练效率低和预测精度不足的问题，需要开发更高效的物理信息学习方法。

Method: 使用极限学习机网络替代传统深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过最小二乘法优化输出权重来满足物理定律约束，将逆Stefan问题转化为寻找Moore-Penrose广义逆的问题。

Result: 相比传统PINNs方法，PIELM将相对L2误差提高了3-7个数量级，同时节省了超过94%的训练时间。

Conclusion: PIELM框架为逆Stefan问题提供了一种快速、准确的物理信息学习方法，在精度和效率方面都优于传统PINNs方法。

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

Motivation: 解决大规模网络系统（如交通、电力、无线网络）中强化学习面临的规模和环境变化挑战。

Method: 每个智能体学习稀疏局部因果掩码识别影响其动态的最小邻域变量，生成紧凑表征；元演员-评论家在多个源域上训练共享策略，并在测试时通过少量轨迹估计新域因子并部署适应策略。

Result: GSAC能够快速适应新领域，显著优于从头学习和传统适应基线方法。

Conclusion: GSAC通过因果表征学习和元学习相结合，有效解决了大规模网络系统中的可扩展性和领域泛化问题，具有理论保证和实际性能优势。

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出统一令牌表示(UTR)方法，将回报、状态和动作合并为单个令牌，显著减少序列长度和模型复杂度，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer离线强化学习方法存在令牌冗余和二次注意力复杂度问题，限制了在实时或资源受限环境中的可扩展性。

Method: 开发统一令牌表示(UTR)，将回报、状态和动作合并为单个令牌，并基于Transformer和门控CNN分别构建UDT和UDC两个变体。

Result: UTR方法在保持或超越现有最优方法性能的同时，显著降低了计算复杂度，理论分析显示其具有更紧的Rademacher复杂度界限。

Conclusion: UTR方法在不同架构上泛化良好，为未来大规模决策模型的可扩展控制提供了高效基础。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN的序列性限制了并行计算能力，而现有的并行架构如Transformers和状态空间模型在线性约束下表达能力受限，无法建模复杂的非线性序列依赖关系。

Method: 将非线性递归关系序列转化为单一方程组，使用牛顿迭代结合自定义并行归约方法进行并行求解，实现非线性RNN的并行化训练。

Result: 实现了高达665倍的加速比，成功训练了70亿参数的LSTM和GRU模型，困惑度与同规模Transformer和Mamba2架构相当。

Conclusion: ParaRNN打破了非线性RNN的序列并行化障碍，为高效序列建模研究提供了开源框架，使研究人员能够大规模探索新的非线性RNN模型。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释复杂系统（如推荐系统）的输出对用户和公司都至关重要。用户上传的照片可以强化或证明他们对物品的评价，因此预测用户会拍摄的照片可以作为最佳说服论据。

Method: 提出一个形式化框架来估计给定（用户，照片）对的作者概率。使用TripAdvisor收集的餐厅评论数据（包含照片）进行实验验证。

Result: 通过预测用户可能拍摄的照片，推荐系统可以解释其推荐结果，提高可靠性。同时公司可以了解客户关注的产品特性分布。

Conclusion: 将个性化解释作为推荐学习是可行的，照片预测不仅能增强推荐系统的解释能力，还能为企业提供客户偏好的可视化洞察。

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果机器学习方法通常假设已知暴露映射，这在现实中往往不切实际；同时同质性与处理分配机制的交互会导致网络级协变量偏移，影响处理效应估计准确性。

Method: HINet方法整合图神经网络和领域对抗训练，无需已知暴露映射，同时减轻网络级协变量偏移的影响。

Result: 在合成和半合成网络数据集上的广泛实证评估证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: HINet能够有效估计未知暴露映射下的处理效应，并缓解网络级协变量偏移问题。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: ZEN模型在保持表达力的同时实现了高效性，其决策过程完全可解释，为数据集特性提供了洞察。

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up
to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor. Moreover, the decision process of
ZEN is fully interpretable, providing insights into the characteristic of a
dataset. Our code and datasets are fully available at

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

Result: 证明均值向量可分性是UME可学习性的充分条件但非必要条件，建立了可数并集的UME可学习性。

Conclusion: 提出了UME可学习性框架，解决了相关猜想，为均匀估计理论提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

### [204] [Probe-based Fine-tuning for Reducing Toxicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21531)
*Jan Wehner,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了使用探针训练模型时如何避免Goodhart定律的问题，提出了两种基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的方法，发现在偏好学习目标下探针检测能力反而得到保持，且重新训练探针比使用探针集成更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探针可用于检测模型内部的不良行为（如欺骗或偏见），但将其作为训练目标时可能因Goodhart定律而失效。研究旨在探索如何在训练中使用探针的同时保持其检测可靠性。

Method: 提出两种方法：基于监督微调和直接偏好优化的探针训练，在毒性检测测试平台上评估，尝试使用探针集成、保留未训练探针和训练后重新训练探针来保持检测准确性。

Result: 基于探针的偏好优化意外地比基于分类器的方法更好地保持了探针检测能力；探针多样性带来的实际益处有限，只需在优化后重新训练探针即可恢复高检测精度。

Conclusion: 基于探针的训练在某些对齐方法中是可行的，当重新训练可行时，探针集成基本上是不必要的。

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为时空区域扭曲（SRD）的伪异常生成方法，通过增强弱监督视频异常检测模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测模型容易受到对抗攻击，而由于弱监督的局限性（只有视频级标签），传统的对抗训练方法效果不佳。伪标签虽然能实现帧级对抗训练，但噪声严重影响性能。

Method: 提出了时空区域扭曲（SRD）方法，通过对正常视频中的局部区域应用严重增强来创建合成异常，同时保持时间一致性。将这些精确标注的合成异常与噪声伪标签结合，显著减少了标签噪声。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了WSVAD模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，整体AUROC性能平均比最先进方法高出71.0%。

Conclusion: SRD方法通过生成精确标注的合成异常，有效解决了弱监督视频异常检测中对抗训练的标签噪声问题，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

*Nikolai Gruzinov,Ksenia Sycheva,Earl T. Barr,Alex Bezzubov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了修订相似性问题，引入切除分数(ES)作为新的评估指标，通过移除共享内容来更准确地衡量文档修订的相似性，在代码编辑评估中显著优于现有指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相似性指标(如BLEU)在评估文档修订时存在问题，因为它们被共享内容主导，无法准确反映人类对修订差异的判断。

Method: 提出切除分数(ES)，使用最长公共子序列(LCS)移除现有文档与修订版本之间的共享内容，然后比较剩余的不同区域，并通过近似算法将计算复杂度从立方降低到平方。

Result: 在HumanEvalFix数据集上，ES比最接近的竞争对手SARI提高了12%的皮尔逊相关性，比标准指标如BLEU提高了>21%。当增加共享上下文时，ES的优势进一步扩大到20%和>30%。

Conclusion: ES是一个有效的修订相似性度量，能够更好地与人类判断对齐，特别适用于代码编辑评估任务。

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

Motivation: 空天地一体化多接入边缘计算(SAGIN-MEC)为低空经济提供灵活计算服务，但面临异构节点协调、复杂因素建模和部分可观测环境下实时决策等挑战。

Method: 提出MADDPG-COCG算法：使用MADDPG优化连续时序决策，结合凸优化和联盟博弈方法处理混合变量决策，解决NP-hard的用户设备成本最小化问题。

Result: 仿真结果表明，相比基准算法，MADDPG-COCG显著降低了用户设备总成本、任务完成延迟和能耗，仅轻微增加无人机能耗，并具有更好的收敛稳定性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: MADDPG-COCG算法有效解决了SAGIN-MEC系统中的复杂优化问题，为低空经济应用提供了高效的计算服务协调方案。

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

TL;DR: ZETA是一个零样本多模态框架，通过将ECG信号与结构化的临床观察进行对比来实现可解释的心电图诊断，无需疾病特定的微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前自动化ECG诊断系统在透明性和对未见病症泛化能力方面的不足，使AI诊断更符合临床工作流程。

Method: 使用预训练多模态模型对齐ECG和文本嵌入，通过LLM辅助、专家验证的过程构建结构化正负临床观察数据集，模拟鉴别诊断过程。

Result: 实证评估显示ZETA在零样本分类性能上具有竞争力，并在定性和定量上提供了增强的可解释性证据，将预测基于具体的临床相关诊断特征。

Conclusion: ZETA展示了将ECG分析与结构化临床知识对齐的潜力，有助于构建更透明、可泛化和可信赖的AI诊断系统。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Motivation: 神经网络擅长处理非结构化数据但泛化能力差，而经典算法保证正确性但缺乏灵活性。探索将经典算法的先验知识嵌入GNN是否能提升其在真实世界图数据上的性能。

Method: 在CLRS算法推理基准的24个经典算法上预训练GNN，然后用预训练模型初始化并冻结分子预测GNN的选定层，与随机初始化基线进行比较。

Result: 预训练模型在ogbg-molhiv和ogbg-molclintox分子预测任务上取得一致优势或平局，其中Segments Intersect算法预训练在HIV抑制任务上获得6%绝对增益，Dijkstra预训练在临床毒性任务上获得3%增益。

Conclusion: 将经典算法先验嵌入GNN可以提供有用的归纳偏置，提升在复杂真实世界图数据上的性能。

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

Conclusion: 深度神经网络通过分层概率密度演化构建语义表示，冗余神经元在正则化和零训练误差条件下出现，有助于泛化而非过拟合。

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

Conclusion: REVE支持标准化EEG研究，加速临床神经科学进展，并发布了代码、预训练权重和教程。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

TL;DR: 提出HOPSS算法，通过同源扰动方法用更少时间步生成训练数据，显著降低数据生成时间成本，同时保持模型训练精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动深度学习方法需要大量解对数据，这些数据通常通过传统数值方法生成，需要数千个时间步迭代，远多于训练所需的几十个，造成沉重的计算和时间开销。

Method: 首先从可靠求解器获取基础解函数，通过降采样对齐时间步；然后提出"同源扰动"方法：将两个解函数（一个作为主函数，另一个作为同源扰动项）与随机噪声结合，高效生成精度相当的PDE数据点；最后用这些数据点计算原方程右端项变化形成新的解对。

Result: 理论和实验结果表明HOPSS降低了时间复杂度。例如在Navier-Stokes方程上，生成10,000个样本仅需传统方法约10%的时间，且模型训练性能相当。

Conclusion: HOPSS算法能够显著加速PDE训练数据生成，同时保持模型训练精度，为解决非线性时间偏微分方程的数据生成瓶颈提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

Conclusion: 张量网络的SHAP计算复杂性分析表明，对于这类模型，宽度而非深度是SHAP计算的主要计算瓶颈，这一发现对模型解释性具有重要启示。

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

Motivation: 解决现有图聚类模型的局限性，特别是SBM假设顶点度均匀和DCBM在簇间应用统一度校正的问题，PABM引入了簇内和簇间连接的独立流行度参数。

Method: 在PABM框架下分析聚类误差率的最优界限，通过理论推导和数值实验验证，比较传统谱聚类与使用k²个特征向量的改进方法。

Result: 证明了在PABM中，即使传统边密度信号消失，只要簇内和簇间流行度系数不同，聚类恢复仍然可能；使用k²个特征向量的谱聚类在合成和真实数据集上表现更优。

Conclusion: PABM捕捉到了DCBM忽略的度异质性维度，局部连接模式的差异可以独立于全局边密度增强簇可分离性；由于PABM的期望邻接矩阵秩在k到k²之间，传统谱嵌入可能丢失重要结构信息。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.
