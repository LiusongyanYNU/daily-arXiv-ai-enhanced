### [1] [Detection and Recovery of Adversarial Slow-Pose Drift in Offloaded Visual-Inertial Odometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07130)
*Soruya Saha,Md Nurul Absur,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了视觉悬洞量测量(VIO)在边缘服务器中的安全风险，提出了一种无监督的检测和恢复机制来防范妥协攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将VIO计算移至边缘服务器的趋势导致服务器端安全风险增加，细微的妥协攻击可能累积成显著的偏移，同时避免启发经验检查。

Method: 提出一种无监督、无标签的检测和恢复机制。模型在无攻击会话中训练，学习运动的时间规律性，用于检测运行时偏移并启动恢复以恢复妥协一致性。

Result: 在实际的边缘VIO环境中使用ILLIXR测试床进行评估，结果显示与无防御基准相比，轨迹和妥协错误实现了显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测并恢复VIO系统中的妥协攻击，提高了虚拟现实系统的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

### [2] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellPainTR是基于Transformer的架构，能够学习对批次效应鲁棒的细胞形态学基础表征，无需微调即可泛化到未见数据集，在批次整合和生物信号保留方面优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合海量异构数据集，但技术批次效应和缺乏可泛化模型是主要障碍。JUMP Cell Painting联盟等数据集存在批次效应问题，需要开发能够跨数据集泛化的基础模型。

Method: 提出CellPainTR Transformer架构，采用源特定上下文令牌设计，能够学习对批次效应鲁棒的细胞形态学表征。该方法无需在新数据上重新训练，即可实现有效的分布外泛化。

Result: 在大型JUMP数据集上验证，CellPainTR在批次整合和生物信号保留方面优于ComBat和Harmony等传统方法。在未见Bray数据集上的挑战性OOD任务中，尽管存在显著域和特征偏移，仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了创建真正基于图像的细胞分析基础模型的重要进展，能够实现更可靠和可扩展的跨研究生物分析。

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [3] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLOv8n和Vision Transformer的多模态融合架构，结合图像和音频信息进行铁路缺陷检测，相比单模态方法精度提升0.2个点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态检测方法在铁路缺陷检测中存在过检测问题，特别是当缺陷外观与正常结构元素相似时。音频信号可以提供补充信息来改善检测性能

Method: 构建基于领域规则的多模态融合架构，使用YOLOv8n进行快速目标检测，结合Vision Transformer从多个层级（7、16、19）提取特征图，并与合成的音频表示进行融合，针对铁路断裂和表面缺陷两类缺陷

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上的实验表明，多模态融合相比纯视觉方法精度和整体准确率提升0.2个点，学生非配对t检验证实了平均准确率差异的统计显著性

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法能有效提升铁路缺陷检测性能，音频信息的引入有助于减少误检，提高检测精度

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [4] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的后处理OOD检测方法ClaFR，通过分类器权重的正交分解获得类已知子空间，计算特征重构误差来识别分布外数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于特征的后处理方法需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景中不适用，因此需要开发不依赖训练数据的OOD检测方法。

Method: ClaFR方法：1）对分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间；2）将原始特征映射到该子空间获得新表示；3）计算子空间内的特征重构误差作为OOD分数。

Result: 在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据。

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理OOD检测方法，解决了数据隐私场景下的OOD检测问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [5] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一个简单的持续预训练策略，可以在小规模专业领域数据集上有效调整基础模型，无需标签和额外超参数，仅用1000张图像就能显著提升DINOv3等先进模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域中数据集规模小、无法应用大规模预训练的SSL方法，以及预训练模型缺乏重要信息继续训练的问题。

Method: 提出DIET-CP策略，使用简单的目标函数，无需标签，不引入比监督微调更多的超参数，能够将任何强大的基础模型引导到新的数据分布。

Result: 方法在不同数据模态和骨干网络选择上都表现稳定，仅使用1000张图像就能为DINOv3等最先进模型带来显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: DIET-CP提供了一个简单有效的解决方案，填补了基础模型在小规模专业领域数据集上持续预训练的空白。

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [6] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种联邦对抗提示调优方法，通过类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略，有效提升了联邦提示调优的对抗鲁棒性，解决了非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦提示调优(FPT)方法虽然高效，但容易受到对抗攻击导致下游任务误分类。特别是在非独立同分布(non-IID)设置下，存在客户端与全局模型之间的类别信息差距问题。

Method: 提出类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为引导生成视觉提示；采用跨层生成器共享策略增强不同层间的提示耦合；通过FedAPT框架提升对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedAPT在提升对抗鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中展现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedAPT通过解决类别信息差距问题，有效提升了联邦提示调优的对抗鲁棒性，具有很好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [8] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD框架填补了学术评估与企业部署需求之间的鸿沟，通过10个关键业务任务和创新的BlockWeaver算法，在真实数据集上评估开源视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于选择题和合成数据的基准测试无法反映企业实际应用需求，需要建立更贴近真实业务场景的评估框架。

Method: 提出ViLD框架，定义10个企业关键任务；开发BlockWeaver算法用于OCR输出比较；构建包含7500个真实样本的基准数据集；结合语义匹配、传统指标和新方法进行综合评估。

Result: 在Qwen、MIMO和InternVL等开源VLM与专有基线的对比评估中，提供了首个基于行业实际需求的VLM能力评估。

Conclusion: ViLD为企业部署VLM提供了可操作的见解，填补了学术研究与企业应用之间的评估鸿沟。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [9] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头部信息来学习协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901，显著优于基线方法，并提高了跨模态和厂商的校准性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统处理，其中扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响图像对比度、噪声和伪影。这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了仅基于图像的神经网络在不同站点间的泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头部信息作为标签，通过三种方式学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换。使用126万项研究数据进行实验。

Result: 在三个临床任务上表现优异：肺栓塞CT分诊（+0.046 AUROC）、脑胶质瘤MRI分级（+0.058 AUROC）、心胸比X光检测（+0.041 AUROC），获得25-37%的校准改进，且在10-20%标注数据下仍保持优势。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome方法能有效减少协议边界处的假阳性，适用于PACS系统，提供了模型卡片和部署指南，包括去标识化和偏倚审计。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型在激烈文本扰动下识别能力严重下降，与人类的弹性识别能力形成明显对比


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索先进视觉语言模型是否与人类一样具有对文字符号的弹性识别能力，而不受字符碎片化、融合或遮挡的影响

Method: 构建两个受心理物理学启发的测试标准（中文象形文字和英文字母词汇），通过切割、重组和叠加字形来创造"可见但不可读"的刺激物，但仍保持人类可读性

Result: 虽然在清晰文本上表现强劲，但现代VLMs在这些干扰下性能严重下降，经常产生无关或不连贯的输出，显示出结构性限制

Conclusion: 模型过于依赖通用视觉不变性而少了组合性先验知识，需要编码符号分割、组合和绑定的新架构和训练策略，以支持教育、无障碍、文化遗产和安全领域的应用

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

### [11] [K-Syn: K-space Data Synthesis in Ultra Low-data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06997)
*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在频域进行特征级学习的方法，通过时间融合策略生成k空间数据，用于动态心脏MRI重建，在低数据条件下表现出强大的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于心脏磁共振成像的动态性和复杂性，实践中难以获得高质量和多样化的k空间数据，这阻碍了动态心脏MRI的稳健重建。

Method: 在频域进行特征级学习，利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，将频域视为自然全局特征空间。采用时间融合策略整合跨时间帧的k空间数据，指导生成轨迹优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在低数据条件下具有强大的生成能力，能够有效缓解动态MRI重建中的数据稀缺问题。

Conclusion: 频域特征级建模结合时间融合策略为动态心脏MRI重建提供了一种实用的解决方案，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次明确评估模型在语义和感知上差异较大的类别间的属性知识过渡能力，发现模型表现随着训练测试集相关性降低而冲击性下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估模型是否能够将属性知识演绎到语义和感知上差异较大的类别之间，而之前的研究主要集中在窄分类或视觉相似的域

Method: 通过五种训练测试集分割策略逐渐减少训练测试集间的相关性：LLM驱动语义分组、嵌入相似度阈值、嵌入聚类和超级类别分区

Result: 结果显示随着训练测试类别相关性降低，模型性能冲击性下降，其中聚类方法在减少隐藏相关性和保持可学习性方面最有效

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了当前表示学习方法的局限性，为属性推理的未来基准构建提供了新的见解

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

*Ahmed R. Sadik,Mariusz Bujny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种统一的量化评估框架，用于评估大语言模型生成的3D模型的几何和结构保真度，通过综合性指标系统对比生成模型与真实CAD模型的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够解释多模态输入生成复杂3D形状，但缺乏系统的方法来评估其几何和结构保真度，导致在CAD设计民主化、反向工程和快速原型制造等应用中遇到挑战。

Method: 提出了一套综合的相似性和复杂性指标，包括体积准确性、表面对齐度、尺寸保真度和拓扑细节程度，并以L垂直构件为案例，系统比较了四种输入模态（二维正伴图、等质测绘图、几何结构树和代码级提示）的表现。

Result: 研究发现通过增加语义丰富度可以提高生成保真度，代码级提示在所有指标上实现了完美重建。量化评估方法能够显著提高向真实模型的收敛速度，较传统仅依靠视觉检查和人类直觉的定性方法更有效。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅推进了对AI辅助形状合成的理解，还提供了一种可扩展的方法论来验证和精炼生成模型，为多样化的CAD应用提供了强有力的验证工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术在边缘设备上应用受限，主要因为高内存消耗。现有压缩方法大多只关注存储压缩，未能解决渲染内存瓶颈

Method: 使用轻量级任意方向球形高斯瓣替代内存密集的球谐函数作为颜色表示，并提出统一的软剪枝框架将基元数量和瓣数量剪枝建模为约束优化问题

Conclusion: MEGS²通过联合优化基元数量和参数数量，成功解决了3D高斯泼溅技术的渲染内存瓶颈问题

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的正则化损失函数，通过空间域矩和频域力谱结合的方式，促使潜在空间样本符合标准正态分布，以支持文本到图像模型的下游任务优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在文本到图像模型的潜在空间中进行有效的优化，需要一种能够促使样本符合标准正态分布的正则化方法，以提高下游任务的性能和效率。

Method: 将高维样本元素视为一维标准正态变量，设计空间域矩正则化和频域力谱正则化组合的复合损失函数，并通过随机排列确保排列不变性。

Result: 在生成模型的测试时奖励对齐任务中，该正则化方法在提高美学质量和文本对齐方面超过以往正态性正则化，有效防止奖励洗码并加速收敛。

Conclusion: 该统一框架不仅提供了效果更好的正则化方法，还将现有正态性正则化方法纵向统一，显示了在文本到图像模型潜在空间优化中的强大潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Conclusion: 奖励函数优化框架有效提升了基础模型在显微镜形容分析中的性能和实用性

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

the application of data distillation as an innovative approach to improve the
precision of streaming image data classification. By focusing on distilling
essential features from data streams, our method aims to minimize computational

*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，用于评估AI生成图像中的社会偏见。研究发现大型多模态模型不仅复制而且放大了职业性别刻板印象，存在显著的默认男性偏见，且不同模型的偏见程度差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然识别了大型多模态模型中的性别偏见，但方法学限制阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。需要开发标准化评估工具来促进AI开发的问责制和公平性。

Method: 使用75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，测试13个商业可用的大型多模态模型，生成刻板印象男性、女性和非刻板印象职业的人物图像，然后使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张图像进行性别代表性评分。

Result: 研究发现：1）LMMs系统性放大职业性别刻板印象；2）模型存在强烈默认男性偏见；3）不同模型的偏见程度差异显著（46.7%-73.3%男性代表性）。表现最佳的模型接近性别平等。

Conclusion: 高度偏见并非不可避免的结果，而是设计选择的结果。需要标准化、自动化的评估工具来促进AI开发的问责制和公平性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于块稀疏核的注意力机制替代方案，用于解决多视图重建中transformer模型的二次复杂度瓶颈问题，实现了4倍推理加速且保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的transformer-based多视图重建模型（如VGGT和π³）虽然效果出色，但由于全局注意力层的二次复杂度，在处理大规模图像集时存在运行时瓶颈。通过分析发现注意力概率质量集中在少数与跨视图几何匹配相关的patch-patch交互上。

Method: 基于结构化注意力的观察，并受大语言模型最新进展的启发，提出了使用高度优化的块稀疏核来替代密集全局注意力操作的方法。该方法无需重新训练主干网络，适用于VGGT和π³模型，并支持大规模图像集合。

Result: 在全面的多视图基准测试中，该方法实现了高达4倍的推理加速，同时保持了可比较的任务性能。

Conclusion: 提出的块稀疏注意力机制有效解决了多视图重建中transformer模型的扩展性问题，为大规模图像集处理提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究假设人脸增强技术在提升感知质量的同时会降低深度伪造检测器的性能，想要系统评估这些技术是否可以作为反取证工具使用。

Method: 使用传统图像处理方法和先进的基于GAN的增强技术，在FaceForensics++、DeepFakeDetection和CelebDF-v2数据集上评估对Naïve、空间和频域检测方法的影响，并进行对抗训练实验。

Result: 实验表明基础增强滤波器可将攻击成功率提升至64.63%，而GAN-based技术进一步利用这些漏洞，攻击成功率可达75.12%。

Conclusion: 人脸增强方法能有效作为反取证工具，强调了需要开发更具弹性和适应性的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

Motivation: 监督学习需要大量标签数据，但在开放世界环境中，新类别可能会不断出现，而传统半监督方法存在限制。需要一种全无监督的方法来解决新类发现问题。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer生成向量嵌入，利用注意力机制估计聚类数量，结合流形学习技术优化嵌入表征，利用数据的内在几何结构提升聚类性能。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Tiny ImageNet数据集上创造了单模态聚类和新类发现的新的独立SOTA结果，无论聚类数量是否预先知道。

Conclusion: 该全无监督方法能够有效地发现图像数据中的新类别，为开放世界学习提供了一种新的解决方案，具有重要的实践价值。

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

### [22] [XBusNet: Text-Guided Breast Ultrasound Segmentation via Multimodal Vision-Language Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07213)
*Raja Mallina,Bryar Shareef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XBusNet是一种新颖的双提示双分支多模态模型，结合图像特征和临床文本提示，通过全局语义和局部边界建模实现精确的乳腺超声分割，在BLU数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺超声分割对可靠测量和定量分析至关重要，但小病灶或低对比度病灶由于边缘模糊和斑点噪声而难以精确分割。文本提示能提供临床上下文，但直接应用弱定位的文本-图像线索往往产生粗糙的边界响应。

Method: 提出XBusNet双提示双分支多模态模型：全局路径基于CLIP Vision Transformer编码全图像语义；局部U-Net路径强调精确边界，通过描述形状、边缘和BI-RADS术语的提示进行调制。提示从结构化元数据自动组装，无需手动点击。

Result: 在BLU数据集上达到最先进性能，平均Dice为0.8765，IoU为0.8149，优于六个强基线。小病灶提升最大，漏检区域和虚假激活减少。消融研究显示全局上下文、局部边界建模和提示调制的互补贡献。

Conclusion: 融合全局语义与局部精度的双提示双分支多模态设计能产生准确的乳腺超声分割掩码，并提高对小、低对比度病灶的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Conclusion: 高级生成模型与可解释特征的协同作用能构建高准确的医疗诊断工具

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

Motivation: 传统多模态模型训练依赖图像-文本对，但文本标注通常稀疏且缺乏细粒度视觉细节，即使使用数百词描述简单图像也存在信息缺失

Method: Reconstruction Alignment (RecA)方法：利用模型自身的视觉理解嵌入作为密集文本提示，通过自监督重建损失优化模型重构输入图像，实现理解和生成的对齐

Result: 仅用27 GPU小时，在GenEval(0.73→0.90)和DPGBench(80.93→88.15)上显著提升生成性能，编辑基准ImgEdit(3.38→3.75)和GEdit(6.94→7.25)也有提升，超越更大开源模型

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于自回归、掩码自回归和基于扩散的多模态模型，能一致改善生成和编辑保真度

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Conclusion: DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，通过双域增强和优先级引导的Mamba融合实现了更好的检测性能

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN方法通过拓扑图精炼和门控信息传播机制，有效解决了骨架动作识别中模糊动作区分的问题，具有良好的泛化能力

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

TL;DR: LGAA是一个端到端的PBR材质3D资产生成框架，通过多视角扩散先验统一建模几何和材质，采用模块化设计实现高效训练和高质量资产生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D生成方法主要关注几何建模，将纹理合成留给后处理，缺乏端到端的PBR材质3D资产生成方案。

Method: 采用模块化设计：LGAA Wrapper重用多视角扩散模型层，LGAA Switcher整合多个扩散先验，LGAA Decoder预测带PBR通道的2D高斯泼溅，最后通过后处理提取可重光照的网格资产。

Result: 实验证明LGAA在文本和图像条件多视角扩散模型中表现优异，仅需6.9万多视角实例即可高效收敛，生成高质量可重光照资产。

Conclusion: LGAA提供了一个有效的端到端PBR材质3D资产生成解决方案，模块化设计支持灵活整合多个扩散先验，知识保留方案实现高效训练。

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EgoGazeVQA基准，利用注视信息提升多模态大语言模型在自我中心视频问答中的表现，通过注视引导的意图提示方法显著改善用户意图理解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽略了注视作为用户意图指示器的重要作用，自我中心视频通过统一坐标系直接捕捉用户焦点、动作和上下文，为个性化AI体验提供了机会

Method: 构建了基于注视的问答对数据集，由MLLMs生成并经人工标注精炼，提出了注视引导的意图提示方法，整合空间、时间和意图相关线索

Result: 现有MLLMs难以准确解释用户意图，而注视引导方法显著提升性能，注视估计准确性影响提示效果

Conclusion: 注视信息对于在自我中心环境中实现更个性化和有效的AI助手具有重要价值

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

TL;DR: GLEAM-C是一个统一多视角多模态的跨视角地理定位基础模型，通过卫星图像对齐无人机、街景地图、全景图和地面照片。GLEAM-X结合了跨视角对应预测与可解释推理，利用多模态大语言模型提供匹配理由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角地理定位方法通常局限于单一视角或模态，且缺乏可解释性——只能预测图像是否对应，无法解释匹配依据。

Method: GLEAM-C采用两阶段训练策略，通过优化实现提升训练效率；GLEAM-X利用多模态大语言模型进行可解释推理，构建双语基准数据集。

Result: GLEAM-C达到与先前模态特定模型相当的准确度；GLEAM-X通过人工精炼测试集，系统评估可解释跨视角推理能力。

Conclusion: GLEAM-C和GLEAM-X形成了完整的CVGL流程，统一了准确跨视角匹配与可解释推理，提升了地理定位的透明度和可扩展性。

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

TL;DR: XOCT是一个深度学习框架，通过跨维度监督和多尺度特征融合实现层感知的OCT到OCTA血管重建，显著提升视网膜血管成像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCTA成像存在运动敏感性和高成本问题，现有深度学习方法忽视视网膜层间血管差异且难以重建密集血管细节

Method: 结合跨维度监督模块（使用分割加权z轴平均生成的2D层间投影作为监督信号）和多尺度特征融合网络（通过多尺度特征提取和通道重加权策略）

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上验证了性能提升，特别是对临床评估至关重要的en-face投影质量显著改善

Conclusion: XOCT有潜力提高OCTA的可及性、可靠性和诊断价值，促进眼科疾病的检测和监测

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了偏差感知机器遗忘方法，通过选择性移除有偏样本或特征表示来减少视觉模型中的多种偏差，在多个数据集上显著提高了公平性指标，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络容易依赖训练数据中的虚假相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生有偏或不公平的预测。传统偏差缓解方法需要从头重新训练或重新设计数据管道，而机器遗忘技术提供了一种后处理的替代方案。

Method: 基于隐私保护遗忘技术，评估了多种策略包括梯度上升、LoRA和师生蒸馏方法，在CUB-200-2011（姿态偏差）、CIFAR-10（合成补丁偏差）和CelebA（微笑检测中的性别偏差）三个基准数据集上进行实证分析。

Result: 后处理遗忘方法显著减少了子群体差异，在CUB-200上人口统计公平性提高了94.86%，CIFAR-10上提高了30.28%，CelebA上提高了97.37%，同时准确率损失最小，在效用、公平性、质量和隐私的联合评估中平均得分为0.62。

Conclusion: 机器遗忘是一个实用的框架，可以在不需要完全重新训练的情况下增强已部署视觉系统的公平性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

present MedicalPatchNet, an inherently self-explainable architecture for chest
X-ray classification that transparently attributes decisions to distinct image

independently classifies each patch, and aggregates predictions, enabling
intuitive visualization of each patch's diagnostic contribution without
post-hoc techniques. Trained on the CheXpert dataset (223,414 images),
MedicalPatchNet matches the classification performance (AUROC 0.907 vs. 0.908)
of EfficientNet-B0, while substantially improving interpretability:
MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with
Grad-CAM) on the CheXlocalize dataset. By providing explicit, reliable
explanations accessible even to non-AI experts, MedicalPatchNet mitigates risks

Result: 实验结果验证了方法的有效性，能够生成生动自然的向量图形动画，在灵活性和动画质量方面显著改善了现有技术

Conclusion: 该方法成功绑定了向量图形和沉硅模型之间的领域差距，为向量图形动画自动化提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually

navigational performance. After applying LoRA, the model significantly improved
in generating directional instructions, overcoming limitations in the original
BLIP-2 model.

TL;DR: DiGS是一个将SDF学习嵌入3D高斯溅射框架的统一方法，通过为每个高斯分配可学习的SDF值来增强几何一致性，并采用几何引导的网格增长策略来改善表面重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在渲染方面表现优异，但由于表示的无结构性和缺乏显式几何监督，难以实现准确完整的表面重建。

Method: 在3DGS管道中嵌入SDF学习，为每个高斯关联可学习的SDF值；设计几何引导的多尺度网格增长策略，自适应地在几何一致区域分布高斯。

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS在保持高渲染保真度的同时，显著提高了重建准确性和完整性。

Conclusion: DiGS通过整合SDF学习到3D高斯溅射中，成功解决了表面重建的挑战，实现了渲染质量和几何准确性的双重提升。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Conclusion: 所提出的局部混合和logits优化框架能够有效提升对抗性示例的可转移性，为深度神经网络的安全部署提供了有效的安全保障方案。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Motivation: 3D数据标注成本高昂，现有弱监督方法仅依赖2D框标注存在投影模糊性和部分可见性问题，需要开发更有效的弱监督解决方案

Conclusion: MVAT通过有效利用时序多视图信息和蒸馏学习，成功解决了弱监督3D检测中的关键挑战，为降低3D标注成本提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Result: 构建了包含5个临床相关手势的数据集，超过1100条记录（6小时），25名健康受试者，支持手势分类、手势触发检测和动作质量评估

Conclusion: EHWGesture可作为推进多模态临床手势理解的综合基准数据集

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand
dexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic
gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal
variations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view
diversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component
embedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video
dataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.
It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

TL;DR: UFC是一个通用的少样本控制适配器，能够通过少量样本快速适应新的空间控制条件，在多种扩散模型架构上实现细粒度控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的控制适配器在面对与训练任务差异较大的新空间控制条件时，适应能力有限且训练成本高，需要一种能够快速泛化到新任务的解决方案。

Method: 提出UFC方法，通过查询条件和支持条件之间的类比来构建任务特定的控制特征，使用匹配机制和小型任务特定参数更新来实现少样本适应。

Result: 在6个新空间控制任务上，仅用30个标注样本微调就能实现与空间条件一致的细粒度控制，使用0.1%的全训练数据即可达到与全监督基线竞争的性能。

Conclusion: UFC是一个通用且高效的少样本控制适配器，能够快速适应各种新空间控制任务，适用于不同的扩散模型架构，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于Hounsfield单位(HU)的前景遮罩策略，改善了3D医学图像中的掩码图像建模性能，通过重点关注内臭器官等有诊断意义的组织区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前掩码图像建模(MIM)在3D医学图像中应用有限，随机遮罩策略忽视了解剖结构密度，需要领域特定的掩码方案来提升表征学习效果。

Method: 利用Hounsfield单位(HU)测量实现HU基于前景遮罩，重点关注内臭器官的强度分布，排除空气、液体等无诊断意义的非组织区域。

Result: 在5个公开3D医学图像数据集上表现一致提升：BTCV(~84.64%)、Flare22(~92.43%)、MM-WHS(~90.67%)、Amos22(~88.64%)、BraTS(~78.55%)，分割质量和Dice分数均有显著改善。

Conclusion: 领域中心的MIM方法对医学图像分割表征学习致关重要，HU基于遮罩策略为医学图像处理提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

Conclusion: TextlessRAG为语音驱动的文档问答开辟了新方向，提供了高效准确的无文本解决方案。

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

Motivation: 解决以前方法依赖耗时的GAN逆向和测试时优化的问题，并克服缺乏大规模3D头部数据集的挑战

Method: 使用3D GANs生成大规模合成数据集，采用由粗到细的Gaussian头部生成流水线，通过双分支框架综合球面三平面特征和点基特征进行高效重建

Result: 实验结果显示该框架在现有工作中具有显著效果

Conclusion: 该前向传播框架能够在单次前向传播中完成高效高保真的Gaussian全头部重建，为快速渲染提供了可行方案

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

Method: 使用Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT)架构，结合图注意力卷积和注意力机制，可视化注意力传播过程，评估不同的节点特征组合

Result: 结合局部平均曲率和质心距离作为节点特征获得了0.76的加权F1分数，并产生更全面的注意力可视化，带有指向全局CLS节点的有向边能产生更直观的注意力图

Conclusion: CGAT架构能够生成人类可理解的注意力图，增强信任并促进专家验证，虽然应用于牙科数据，但广泛适用于基于图的分类和回归任务

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Method: 综述分析既往研究成果，重新实现并进行实验，包括：提出新的准证设定、验证传感器缺陷的增长速率和空间分布、分析手掌印图像年龄估计的网络特征学习等。

Result: 证实某些利用传感器缺陷进行图像年龄估计的方法实际上利用了其他追踪（可能是内容偏差），并显示了神经网络容易被分散而无法有效学习年龄追踪。

Conclusion: 时间图像准证学面临着内容偏差的挑战，可解释人工智能方法对验证技术可靠性至关重要，需要更加实际的准证设定和更严格的验证方法。

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

TL;DR: 视觉-语言基础模型的性别偏见评估受到偏关特征的强烈影响，甚至轻微扰动也能导致偏见分数巨大变化，当前评测方法存在重大缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的性别偏见评估标准常包含性别与非性别特征的偏关关系，需要重新考察这些偏关特征是否扭曲了偏见评估结果。

Method: 系统性地对四个广泛使用的评测标准进行非性别特征扰动，包括物体隐磨和背景模糊，并在多种VLM模型上量化其影响。

Result: 轻微扰动（如隐磨10%物体或弱模糊背景）就能导致偏见分数巨大变化：生成式VLM偏移达175%，CLIP变种偏移43%，证明当前评估更多反映模型对偏关特征的响应而非真正的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 由于构建无偏关特征的评测标准极其困难，建议在报告偏见指标时同时提供特征敏感性测量，以实现更可靠的偏见评估。

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

2. 添加辅助token进行MMSE评分预测，提供额外监督信号
3. 采用轻量级的图像和文本提示微调技术

Result: 在仅使用1,500张训练图像的情况下，在两个阿尔茫海默病数据集上达到独制性能，超过了需要10,000张图像进行微调的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新地利用元数据和临床评量指标，实现了高效的3D医学形态适配，为医学视觉-语言模型的实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 该方法为神经退行性疾病诊断提供了一种无需大量标签数据、具有较高可解释性且具有良好泛化能力的解决方案

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 语义水印技术虽然在对抗重生攻击方面很健壮，但因频域完整性损失导致检测性能下降，需要解决这一问题

Method: 提出Hermitian对称弗里叶水印（SFW）方法，通过维护Hermitian对称来保持频域完整性；以及中心感知嵌入策略，减少因裁剪攻击导致的漏洞

Result: 在各种攻击场景下达到了最高的验证和识别性能，超越了之前的方法，同时保持了优秀的图像保真度（FID和CLIP分数）

Conclusion: SFW是一个有效的框架，能够在语义水印中平衡健壮性和图像保真度，解决了这两者之间的本质上的交易

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖于目标特征偏好，通过利用背景的低秩结构特性作为稳定前知，实现了高效的小移动目标检测，具有良好的效果和普适性

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 现有基于单应性、多网格单应性或薄板样条的深度图像配准方法在处理包含深度差异的真实场景时存在固有局限性

Method: 1) 指数衰减自由形变网络(EDFFDNet)使用指数衰减基函数；2) 自适应稀疏运动聚合器(ASMA)将密集交互转为稀疏交互；3) 渐进式相关细化策略利用全局-局部相关模式进行从粗到细的运动估计

Conclusion: 该方法在深度差异场景中表现优异，具有强泛化能力，在多个数据集上优于之前的深度学习方法

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

TL;DR: 通过大语言模型代理组合视频模块，以动态调用子模块的方式来处理复杂视频理解任务，并通过批评器评估执行过程的成功性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然短视频感知性能有显著提升，但当查询变得更复杂和视频更长时，复杂理解性能仍然不足，需要尝试利用现有感知能力来扩展复杂理解能力。

Method: 开发了一个大语言模型代理，给它配备视频模块作为子代理或工具，代理根据每次调用模块的结果动态决定后续步骤，并引入批评器来识别成功与否的执行序列。

Result: 组合代理和批评器的方法在LVBench、Neptune和ActivityNet-RTL等数据集上展现出了强劲的性能。

Conclusion: 通过动态调用子模块的代理方式，结合批评机制，可以有效利用现有视觉感知能力来处理复杂的视频理解任务，提升了复杂理解的性能。

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

*Chunhang Zheng,Zichang Ren,Dou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEEC提出了一种基于语义分割的多熵模型无损图像压缩方法，通过为不同语义区域分配专用熵模型来提升压缩性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法大多使用单一熵模型估计整个图像的概率分布，无法捕捉不同语义区域的多样化统计特征

Method: 利用语义分割识别不同区域并为每个区域分配专用熵模型，采用多通道离散逻辑混合似然建模像素值分布

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的压缩比，同时只引入最小的编码解码延迟

Conclusion: SEEC框架通过语义分割指导的多熵模型选择，能够更准确地估计不同语义区域的概率分布，显著提升无损图像压缩性能

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑梗烈是全球第二大死因，复发率高且死亡率达40%，需要早期识别高风险患者以进行适当治疗。

Method: 收集3D脑部CTA图像数据和临床数据，训练单模态和多模态深度学习模型，进行二进制复发检测和复发免病生存时间预测。

Result: 多模态模型预测复发风险的c-index为0.68，AUC为0.71，发现心脏疾病和颈动脉症状与复发风险显著相关。

Conclusion: 多模态深度学习模型能有效预测脑梗烈复发风险，心脏疾病和颈动脉症状是关键风险因素，需要持续收集数据以优化模型。

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能稳健处理各种发型，并在1小时内完成高效重建

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了3DGS框架，实现了毛发丝级别的几何重建，并提出了评估拓扑准确性的新指标

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RayGauss虽然在新视角合成方面达到最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本过高，无法在真实场景中实现实时渲染

Method: 引入体积渲染加速策略（空域跳过和自适应采样）、增强光线连贯性、尺度正则化减少误报交点、提出新的致密化准则改善远距离区域密度分布

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现5-12倍训练加速和50-80倍渲染速度提升（FPS），PSNR提升最高达+0.56 dB

Conclusion: RayGaussX成功解决了RayGauss的计算效率问题，在保持高质量渲染的同时实现了显著的性能提升，适用于更大规模的场景

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督的多视角神经网络方法，用于融合两个正交各向异性的低分辨率MR图像，实现高质量的超分辨率重建，无需高分辨率训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学MR成像中，需要在扫描时间和图像质量之间取得平衡。传统方法分别分析低分辨率扫描图像耗时且可能导致误判，需要一种能够融合多视角低分辨率图像的方法。

Method: 使用多视角神经网络进行自监督训练，引入稀疏坐标损失函数来整合任意缩放比例的低分辨率图像，结合患者无关的离线阶段和患者特定的在线阶段。

Result: 在两个独立队列的MR图像上评估，相比最先进的自监督超分辨率方法，在不同上采样尺度下表现出相当或更好的性能，患者特定重建速度提升高达10倍。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效融合正交各向异性低分辨率MR图像，实现高质量的超分辨率重建，同时大幅提升重建效率，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

TL;DR: SplatFill是一种新颖的深度引导3D高斯溅射场景修复方法，通过联合深度监督和一致性感知细化，在视觉保真度和效率方面达到最先进水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)在从多视角图像创建逼真3D场景方面表现出色，但对缺失区域（遮挡或场景编辑导致）的修复仍然具有挑战性，常导致模糊细节、伪影和几何不一致

Method: 结合两种关键思想：(1)联合深度基和对象基监督，确保修复的高斯在3D空间中准确定位并与周围几何对齐；(2)提出一致性感知细化方案，选择性识别和修正不一致区域而不破坏场景其余部分

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上的评估显示，SplatFill不仅在视觉保真度上超越现有NeRF基和3DGS基修复方法，还将训练时间减少24.5%，定性结果显示更清晰的细节、更少的伪影和更好的视角一致性

Conclusion: SplatFill通过深度引导和一致性感知方法，有效解决了3DGS场景修复中的关键挑战，实现了高质量的修复结果和显著的效率提升

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的3D物体分割方法存在表示对齐问题：LLM处理高级语义标记，而3D点云仅提供密集几何结构，导致输入输出阶段的限制

Method: 提出Point Linguist Model (PLM)框架，包含Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR)学习对象中心标记，以及Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD)结合LLM推断的几何信息进行精确分割

Result: 在ScanNetv2上提升+7.3 mIoU，在Multi3DRefer上提升+6.0 mIoU，在7个基准测试的4个不同任务中均取得一致性能提升

Conclusion: PLM通过全面的对象中心推理有效解决了3D表示对齐问题，为鲁棒的3D理解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance
with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test

ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable

Conclusion: D-LEAF方法能够有效定位和修正多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题，提供了一种任务无关的注意力引导解决方案，具有可忽略的开销。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency

Motivation: 现有方法主要建立支持目标对象与整个查询图像之间的图像级相关性，但这种相关性包含难以追踪和抑制的硬像素噪声（如无关背景对象），导致背景过拟合。

Method: 设计对象级相关网络（OCNet），包含通用对象挖掘模块（GOMM）和相关构建模块（CCM）。GOMM通过学习显著性和高层相似性线索构建查询通用对象特征，CCM通过分配目标原型来匹配通用对象特征建立对象级相关性。

Result: 在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i数据集上的大量实验表明，该模型达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过模仿生物视觉过程，在对象级信息中识别新对象，建立对象级相关性可以有效挖掘查询目标特征并抑制硬像素噪声，在少样本语义分割任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Result: 在最大CBCT-IOS数据集(3,867患者)上验证，DSC指标显著提升(CBCT+12%, IOS+8%)，在各种成像条件和临床场景中表现鲁棒

Conclusion: ToothMCL是首个多模态牙齿分割预训练框架，实现了最先进的性能，具有良好的泛化能力和临床实用性

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两次迭代的自适应推理算法，解决消费级硬件上对象检测的系统级性能瓶颈问题，在RTX 4060等设备上实现1.85倍速度提升，仅付出5.51% mAP损失的代价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决消费级硬件上对象检测器实际部署时的系统级性能瓶颈问题，这些问题在高端GPU测试中常被忽略，导致标准模型在资源受限环境下无法发挥实际性能。

Method: 提出两次迭代自适应推理算法，该算法无需模型架构改动。算法先进行快速低分辨率检测，只有在检测信心度较低时才升级到高分辨率模型检测。这种方法进行了架构早期退出和分辨率自适应路由的比较分析。

Result: 在5000张COCO数据集上，该方法相比PyTorch早期退出基准实现了1.85倍的速度提升，平均精度(mAP)仅下降5.51%。在RTX 4060等消费级GPU上有效解决了系统级性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种实用可复现的方案，通过将优化重心从纯模型优化转向硬件感知的推理策略，以最大化向量机的吞吐量，从而在消费级设备上部署高性能实时AI。

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Result: 生成的图像特征与指定特征高度相似，为CLIP图像编码器、ResNet-50和视觉Transformer提供了有价值的特征空间洞察

Conclusion: 方法无需额外训练就能分析不同DNN的特征空间，在单智能GPU上运行，为解释DNN内部特征提供了有效工具

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在规模、多样性和推理深度方面存在局限，特别是在渲染表格图像方面，需要构建更全面的视觉表格推理评估数据集。

Method: 采用模块化、可扩展的全自动生成流水线，多个推理LLM协作完成生成、验证和启发等不同角色，通过跨模型提示和LLM陪审团过滤实现多模型协作数据生成。

Result: 实验结果表明，在Visual-TableQA上微调的模型能够很好地泛化到外部基准测试，性能优于多个专有模型，尽管数据集是合成的。

Conclusion: Visual-TableQA为视觉表格推理提供了有效的评估基准，其生成方法展示了低成本高质量数据集构建的可行性，有助于推动多模态表格理解研究的发展。

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full
pipeline and resources are publicly available at

TL;DR: 小型o3系统通过多轮交互工具扩展大多模态模型的视觉搜索能力，支持十几步深度推理，在具有挑战性的视觉搜索任务上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开源多模态模型在视视问题中推理模式单调、交互轮次限制的问题，无法处理需要尝试-错误探索的困难任务

Method: 三部分方法：1构建Visual Probe数据集提供挑战性视觉搜索问题；2发展迭代数据收集管道获取多样化推理轨迹；3提出超轮掩码策略在强化学习中平衡训练效率和测试扩展性

Result: 模型在训练时仅限制6轮交互，但推理时能自然扩展到十几轮，准确性随轮次增加而提升，产生丰富的推理模式和深度思考路径

Conclusion: Mini-o3系统成功实现了多轮深度推理，能够有效解决具有挑战性的视觉搜索问题，为大多模态模型的探索性推理提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人操作中从单张参考图像估计任意未见物体6D姿态的挑战性问题，特别是在3D模型稀缺、单视图重建缺乏度量尺度以及生成模型与真实图像存在域差距的情况下。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1）粗到精对齐模块结合多视图特征匹配和渲染-比较细化来联合优化尺度和姿态；2）文本引导的生成域随机化策略多样化纹理，使合成数据能有效微调姿态估计器。

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light、LM-O等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，远超先前方法，并在真实机器人手上展示了稳健的灵巧抓取能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高保真单视图3D生成支持可靠的单次6D姿态估计，验证了在实际操作中的实用性，为机器人长尾实例操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL是一种通过视觉表示对齐来增强多模态大语言模型视觉推理能力的正则化策略，通过将MLLMs的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型对齐，保留关键视觉细节并补充额外视觉知识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务（如目标计数、空间推理）上表现有限，主要原因是文本监督范式只能提供视觉通路的间接指导，导致训练过程中丢失细粒度视觉细节

Method: 提出VIRAL方法，通过正则化策略将MLLMs的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型(VFMs)的表示进行显式对齐，使模型既能保留输入视觉编码器的关键细节，又能补充VFMs的额外视觉知识

Result: 实验表明该方法在广泛采用的多模态基准测试的所有任务上都取得了持续改进，并通过全面的消融研究验证了关键设计选择

Conclusion: 这一简单发现为在MLLMs训练中有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

Motivation: 多准则决策方法需要有效处理决策者判断中的不确定性和模糊性，特别是在复杂、冲突和不确定的情况下。可再生能源选择是当前关键问题，需要综合考虑技术、管理和政策因素。

Method: 采用Fermatean模糊环境（模糊集的推广），提出基于偏差最大化方法的优化模型来确定部分已知特征权重，并与区间值Fermatean模糊集结合。

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

Method: 利用图信号处理和频率选择性滤波器，基于知识图谱的拉普拉斯特征结构，包含动态图学习、有理滤波器、频谱专家混合、证明引导训练等多种扩展技术。

Result: 在ProofWriter和CLUTRR等基准测试中达到最先进准确率，推理速度更快，对抗扰动鲁棒性更强，可解释性更高，模型决策与符号证明结构高度一致。

Conclusion: Spectral NSR为下一代推理系统提供了可扩展、有原则的基础框架，在透明度、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面超越传统方法。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this

Motivation: 皮肤神经活动(SKNA)作为交感神经系统活动的非侵入性指标，容易受到肌电(EMG)干扰，传统滤波方法效果有限

Method: 设计了轻量一维卷积自动编码器，使用LSTM瓶颈条重建干净SKNA信号，通过离一受试者交叉验证训练模型

Conclusion: 深度学习方法能够在强EMG干扰下保留生理学相关的交感神经爆发特征，为自然环境下的SKNA监测提供更稳健的方案

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,

*Heng Hao,Wenjun Hu,Oxana Verkholyak,Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh,Baruch Gutow,Sima Didari,Masoud Faraki,Hankyu Moon,Seungjai Min*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PaVeRL-SQL是一个结合部分匹配奖励和语言强化学习的框架，用于提升文本到SQL转换模型的执行准确率，在工业级数据库和复杂问题上达到SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到SQL方法在工业级数据库和涉及领域特定业务逻辑的复杂问题上执行准确率较低，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用两种管道：(1)新设计的上下文学习框架与群体自评估（语言强化学习），使用开源和闭源大语言模型作为骨干；(2)思维链强化学习管道，使用小型骨干模型（OmniSQL-7B）配合专门设计的奖励函数和两阶段强化学习训练。

Result: 在Spider、Spider 2.0和BIRD基准测试中达到SOTA结果。Spider2.0-SQLite基准上，语言强化学习管道比SOTA高7.4%，思维链管道高1.4%。混合SQL方言训练带来三倍增益。

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL在现实工业约束下提供了可靠、SOTA级别的文本到SQL转换能力。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FETCH分类器用于法律问题分类，通过混合LLM/ML集成方法和自动生成后续问题来提高准确性，在真实数据集上达到97.37%的准确率，超越GPT-5模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 每年数百万人通过法律援助热线等渠道寻求法律帮助，错误分类会导致严重后果（错过截止日期、失去住房等），需要准确识别法律问题以匹配正确的帮助资源。

Method: 采用混合LLM/ML集成分类方法，并自动生成后续问题来丰富初始问题叙述，使用419个真实非营利律师转介服务查询数据集。

Result: 分类准确率（hits@2）达到97.37%，使用低成本模型组合超越了当前最先进的GPT-5模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著降低法律系统用户引导成本的同时实现了高准确性，有望改善法律帮助资源的匹配效率。

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能电网的发展带来了新的网络安全风险，SCADA协议容易受到非授权访问和拒绝服务攻击，需要有效的入侵检测方案。

Method: 采用CNN-LSTM混合深度学习模型，利用CNN的特征提取能力和LSTM的时序模式识别能力，使用DNP3和IEC104入侵检测数据集进行训练和测试。

Conclusion: 该混合深度学习方法能够有效地检测智能电网中的网络攻击，为智能电网的安全保障提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Result: 实验显示在不同混合翼体上表面预测误差较低，数据集和框架为气动设计研究提供了有力工具

Conclusion: BlendedNet填补了非常规构型数据空白，为气动数据驱动建模研究奠定了基础

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

Motivation: 解决基于云的大语言模型在医疗健康监测中的隐私问题、内存占用高和延迟问题，探索轻量级小语言模型在移动设备上的应用潜力。

Method: 系统评估SLMs在健康预测任务中的表现，使用零样本、少样本和指令微调方法，并将性能最佳的微调SLMs部署到移动设备上进行实际效率评估。

Result: SLMs能够达到与LLMs相当的性能，同时在效率和隐私方面有显著优势，但在处理类别不平衡和少样本场景方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: SLMs尽管目前形式还不完美，但作为下一代隐私保护的医疗健康监测解决方案具有很大潜力。

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

*Vardhan Palod,Karthik Valmeekam,Kaya Stechly,Subbarao Kambhampati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验批判性地验证了中间令牌生成长度与问题难度的关联性，发现这种关联并非真正的问题适应性计算，而是基于训练数据分布的近似回忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对中间令牌生成（ITG）和思维链（CoT）的机制理解不清，广泛存在将长趋势中间追踪触触为"思考"的人类化假设。论文要批判性地验证中间令牌序列长度是否真正反映问题难度。

Method: 使用A* 搜索算法的演绎追踪从头训练变换器模型，这种方法提供了解决迷宫问题所需操作数量的精确可验证问题复杂性测量。首先在简单的自由空间问题上评估，然后系统地在分布外问题上评估中间令牌长度与真实A* 追踪长度的相关性。

Result: 发现即使在最简单的任务中，模型也经常产生过长的推理追踪并有时失败。中间令牌长度与真实A* 追踪长度仅有松散相关。仅在问题近似训练分布时才出现相关性，这表明效果来自于近似回忆而非真正的问题适应性计算。

Conclusion: 问题实例的本质计算复杂性并非关键因素，关键是其与训练数据的分布距离。这些结果挑战了中间追踪生成适应问题难度的假设，并警告不要将R1等系统中更长的序列自动解释为"思考努力"的标志。

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到AlphaEvolve的启发，但AlphaEvolve仅限于数百行代码的独立内核，需要将LLM代码进化扩展到包含数百个文件和数万行代码的完整代码库规模。

Method: SATLUTION框架协调LLM智能体在严格正确性保证和分布式运行时反馈下直接进化求解器代码库，同时自我进化其进化策略和规则。

Result: 从SAT Competition 2024代码库开始，SATLUTION进化的求解器在SAT Competition 2025中显著超越了人类设计的获胜者，同时在2024基准测试中也超越了2024和2025的冠军。

Conclusion: SATLUTION成功证明了LLM代码进化可以扩展到完整代码库规模，在复杂算法问题上实现超越人类专家的性能，为自动化代码优化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

Result: 在Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct模型上的实验显示，通过自我对弈单独就能显著提升在具有挑战性任务上的表现，效果超过了数据驱动的基准方法。

Conclusion: 语言自我对弈为大语言模型的持续改进提供了一种不依赖额外数据的有效途径，有望解决当前模型进步的数据瓦瓦问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

Conclusion: MLLMs通过视觉模态能很好处理重叠和平衡问题，但在对齐方面仍有困难，需要混合规则和视觉反射策略

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

Conclusion: 激活值与攻击效果存在相关性，语义模式在转移性漏洞利用中发挥关键作用，该框架有效提高了黑盒攻击的实用性。

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

Motivation: 现有神经符号AI框架（如DeepProbLog）采用固定的神经处理后再符号推理的流程，无法处理复杂依赖关系，特别是在图等不规则数据结构中表现受限。

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog通过将神经符号AI扩展到图结构领域，提供了一个更表达性和灵活的神经符号集成框架。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

*Jipeng Li,Zeyu Gao,Yubin Qi,Hande Dong,Weijian Chen,Qiang Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了FTR框架，结合用户反馈和增强解码机制，通过负反馈触发再生和长时多路径解码来解决LLM自校正的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时容易生成错误内容，现有自校正方法存在两个关键问题：缺乏可靠的错误定位信号，以及受限于传统next-token解码的推理深度限制

Method: Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR)框架：1) 仅在收到用户负反馈时激活响应再生，避免错误传播；2) Long-Term Multipath (LTM)解码，通过延迟序列评估实现多推理路径的系统探索

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，该框架相比最先进的基于提示的自校正方法取得了持续且显著的改进

Conclusion: FTR框架通过结合用户反馈和增强解码机制，有效解决了LLM自校正的两个核心问题，显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

### [98] [RIMO: An Easy-to-Evaluate, Hard-to-Solve Olympiad Benchmark for Advanced Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07711)
*Ziye Chen,Chengwei Qin,Yao Shu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RIMO是一个新的数学奥林匹克竞赛基准测试，包含整数答案和证明问题两个赛道，旨在消除评估噪声并提供精确的性能测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奥林匹克级别基准测试存在评分噪声和潜在偏见问题，如异构答案格式需要模型判断和依赖可能有缺陷的解决方案。

Method: RIMO-N重写335个IMO问题为单一整数答案；RIMO-P包含456个证明问题，分解为子问题序列并通过自动化评分系统评估逐步推理过程。

Result: 对10个前沿LLM的测试显示，虽然这些系统在旧基准上表现出色，但在RIMO上性能急剧下降，揭示了当前LLM能力与实际奥林匹克级别推理之间的巨大差距。

Conclusion: RIMO提供了一个具有挑战性且易于评估的测试套件，为未来研究提供了高分辨率的标准，明确了需要填补的深刻推理差距。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

*Bo Yu,Zhixiu Hua,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BDPM方法，结合随机森林和递归特征消除来筛选肠道微生物特征，用于帕金森病的早期诊断


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病误诊率高，现有诊断依赖临床评分量表。肠道微生物与帕金森病密切相关，但现有深度学习模型多使用单一分类器，忽略了菌株间相关性和时间动态

Method: 1) 收集39对帕金森患者和健康配偶的肠道微生物数据；2) 开发RFRE特征选择框架（随机森林+递归特征消除），整合生态学知识；3) 设计混合分类模型捕捉微生物数据的时空模式

Result: 论文提出了BDPM特征提取方法，专门针对微生物组数据设计，提高了特征选择的生物可解释性

Conclusion: 该方法为帕金森病的早期诊断提供了更鲁棒的特征提取方案，有望改善基于肠道微生物的生物标志物识别

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合知识增强AI技术的方法，通过聊天机界面估算食品的碳踏足迹，以更可访的方式提供生命周期评估见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环境可持续性和气候变化问题严峙，但进行生命周期评估(LCA)复杂而数据碎片化，需要更易访的碳踏迹估算方法。

Method: 结合LCA进展和公开数据库，使用知识增强AI技术（包括检索增强生成）估算食品从原料到出厂的碳踏迹，并通过聊天机界面交互式探索。

Result: 开发了一个原型系统，能够处理任意食品项目和进一步问题，展示了以可访格式提供LCA见解的潜力和限制。

Conclusion: 该方法为提供更可访的碳踏迹估算开启了新途径，但仍面临数据库不确定性和AI误解等挑战。

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

### [101] [Certainty-Guided Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Dynamic Thinking Budget Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07820)
*João Paulo Nogueira,Wentao Sun,Alonso Silva,Laith Zumot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)方法，通过批判模型自我评估推理置信度，自适应调整推理过程，在保证准确性的同时减少计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理语言模型(LRLMs)在解决复杂任务时存在固定推理预算的问题，无法根据任务难度自适应调整推理深度，导致要么资源浪费要么推理不足。

Method: 受GAN生成器/判别器框架启发，使用批判模型定期评估自身推理置信度，达到目标置信阈值则提前终止，否则继续推理，实现效率与可靠性的自适应平衡。

Result: 在AIME2024和AIME2025数据集上，CGR提高了基线准确率并减少token使用量；64次多种子评估显示稳定性提升，方差减小；可节省数百万token，在准确性和效率间提供可调节权衡。

Conclusion: 置信度是推理充分性的有力信号，CGR通过将置信度整合到推理过程中，使大型推理语言模型更具适应性、可信性和资源效率，为实际部署铺平道路。

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

TL;DR: 研究比较了矩阵基于检索和图基于检索两种RAG方案在教学环境中的表现，提出了动态分支框架来优化查询路由，提高回答准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ChatGPT等大语言模型在教室中提供过时或虚构信息的问题，通过RAG技术基于外部资源提高回答的可靠性。

Method: 使用EduScopeQA数据集(3,176个问题)，比较矩阵检索RAG和图基RAG在不同学科和问题类型下的表现，并使用系统改动的教科书进行测试。

Result: OpenAI矩阵检索RAG在低成本事实检索中表现优异，GraphRAG Global在主题性查询中提供丰富教学内容，GraphRAG Local在数据完整性关键时准确率最高。

Conclusion: 动态分支框架能够根据查询类型路由到最优检索方法，在考虑GraphRAG资源消耗高10-20倍的情况下，提高了实际部署的效果和效率。

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

TL;DR: 通过迭代自我精细方法，利用7B小规模开源LLMs生成高质量代码指令数据，降低对专有大型模型的依赖和成本，基于此训练出独立的SCoder代码生成模型家族。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码LLMs依赖于从专有大型模型精细的大规模指令数据，成本高昂。需要找到一种方法来减少对专有LLMs的依赖并降低数据生成成本。

Method: 提出迭代自我精细方法：1)多检查点采样和多方面评分策略进行初始数据选择；2)基于梯度的影响估计方法进行最终数据过滤；3)使用小规模开源LLMs生成高质量代码指令数据。

Result: 基于小规模合成器生成的代码指令数据集，从DeepSeek-Coder精细训练出SCoder模型家族，在代码生成能力方面达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将小规模开源LLMs转化为强大的数据合成器，显著减少了对专有LLMs的依赖，为高质量代码指令数据的低成本生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: CP-Model-Zoo是一个基于检索的辅导系统，通过自然语言描述从专家编写的模型数据库中匹配最接近的组合问题求解模型，帮助非专家用户使用约束编程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束编程建模语言复杂、全局约束众多且建模需要专业知识，阻碍了非专家用户使用CP解决组合问题。虽然从自然语言生成专家级模型是理想目标，但目前技术尚未达到。

Method: 利用多年积累的专家编写模型构建数据库，通过用户自然语言描述检索最接近的源代码模型，无需人工数据标注即可呈现经过专家验证的模型。

Result: 实验显示，基于不同专业水平的用户输入问题描述，系统在检索正确模型方面表现出色准确率。

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo通过检索专家模型数据库的方式，有效降低了非专家用户使用约束编程的门槛，为组合问题求解提供了实用的辅助工具。

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理基准测试缺乏对真实物理竞赛（如物理奥林匹克）的系统性覆盖，且无法实现与人类选手的直接性能比较

Method: 收集13个最新奥林匹克考试数据，采用官方评分方案进行细粒度评分，基于官方奖牌阈值对模型进行奖牌评级

Result: 开源MLLM大多处于铜牌水平，开源LLM有进步但偶尔获金牌，闭源推理MLLM可获得6-12枚金牌，大多数模型距离满分仍有很大差距

Conclusion: HiPhO作为一个严谨、人类对齐且专注于奥林匹克的基准测试，展示了开源模型与顶尖学生的显著性能差距，以及物理推理能力仍有很大提升空间

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文开发了测量语言模型福利的实验方法，通过比较言词报告咊行为表达的偏好，发现了两者之间的可靠相关性，但也持有对语言模型是否具有福利主体身份的疑问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是开发实验性方法来量化评估语言模型的福利状态，通过比较不同测量方式的一致性来探索是否可以将偏好满足作为人工智能系统福利的代理指标。

Method: 采用了多种实验范式：1）比较模型的言词偏好报告与虚拟环境中的行为选择；2）测试成本和奖励对行为的影响；3）检验完美福利量表在语义等价提示下的一致性。

Result: 观察到了说明的偏好与行为之间的可靠相关性，这支持偏好满足可以作为某些AI系统福利代理指标的可行性。但不同模型和条件下的一致性程度有差异，并且对提示变动敏感。

Conclusion: 虽然对语言模型是否具有福利主体身份仍有不确定性，但研究结果显示了在语言模型中测量福利的可行性，为进一步探索提供了基础。

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

TL;DR: VISION是一个统一的漏洞检测框架，通过生成反事实样本和使用图神经网络来减少伪相关性，提高检测的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于GNN的漏洞检测方法受到训练数据不平衡和标签噪声的限制，容易学习到表面的代码相似性而非真正的漏洞模式，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 使用大型语言模型生成反事实样本，对具有相反标签的配对代码示例进行目标GNN训练，并通过基于图的解释性识别关键代码语句。

Result: VISION显著提高了检测性能：整体准确率从51.8%提升到97.8%，配对对比准确率从4.5%提升到95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升到85.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过反事实训练有效减少了伪相关性学习，实现了更鲁棒和可泛化的漏洞检测，并提供了可解释性工具来增强AI网络安全系统的透明度。

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠质量影响健康康复，需要可访问和可靠的预测工具来支持预防性干预措施。

Method: 提出两阶段域适配策略：训练阶段减少过拟合，测试时源无面适配机制适应新用户。结合多尺度卷积层模拟空间相互作用，递归层和注意力机制捕捉长期时间依赖。

Result: 在5种输入窗口和5种预测窗口下均超过LSTM、Informer、PatchTST、TimesNet等基线方法。最佳结果（3天输入+1天预测）RMSE为0.216，甚至9天预测窗口下仍保持良好性能（RMSE 0.257）。解释性分析显示了特征影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为使用商业可穿戴设备的稀疏数据进行个性化睡眠预测提供了稳健、适应性强和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个配置先行框架，用于评估深度学习系统在CPU、GPU和编译运行时之间的跨后端兼容性问题。通过672次测试发现了跨平台偏差问题，并提出了解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在不同运行时环境（CPU、GPU、编译后端）下存在输出不一致的问题，影响部署的可靠性和可复现性。需要一个系统化的方法来量化和缓解这种跨后端偏差。

Method: 构建了配置先行框架，使用YAML配置文件解耦实验与代码，支持库和仓库模型。采用三层验证协议：张量级别接近度、激活对齐和任务级指标。进行672次测试检查。

Result: 72.0%的运行通过测试，大部分不一致情况发生在更严格的容差阈值下。检测模型和编译后端尤其容易出现偏差，主要原因是非确定性的后处理流程。

Conclusion: 确定性适配器和选择性备用方案可以显著提高不同后端之间的一致性，而不会导致显著性能损失。该框架为深度学习模型在异构运行时环境中的可靠部署提供了可复现的方法论。

Abstract: This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,
and task-level metrics. Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance
settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,
providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across
heterogeneous runtimes.

Conclusion: 所提出的Kriging-HDMR主动学习方法能有效处理高维可靠性分析问题，在保持预测精度的同时显著提高计算效率。

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional
reliability problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 公交车达时预测方法NSATP，通过两阶段系列稳定化和非稳定性恢复，在提高预测性的同时保留有用的非稳定特征，在电车和公交车数据上都取得了更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步达时预测中，非稳定数据会降低模型性能。传统的归一化处理虽然提高预测性，但可能会隐藏有用的非稳定特征（过度稳定化问题）。需要在预测性和非稳定性之间寻找平衡。

Method: 提出两阶段方法NSATP：1）系列稳定化阶段：提高预测性。2）非稳定性效果恢复阶段：将先进方法从一维扩展到二维模型来抓取时间序列中的隐藏周期性，并设计补偿模块通过从原始数据学习缩放和平移因子来恢复过度稳定化的影响。

Result: 在德絗顿125天公交运营数据上验证，与基线方法相比，NSATP在电车数据上将RMSE、MAE和MAPE分别降低了2.37%、1.22%和2.26%，在公交车数据上分别降低了1.72%、0.60%和1.17%。

Conclusion: NSATP方法通过系列稳定化和非稳定性恢复的两阶段设计，有效地在提高多步达时预测性能的同时保留了有用的非稳定特征，解决了过度稳定化问题，在实际公交数据上都取得了显著的性能收益。

Abstract: Arrival time prediction (ATP) of public transport vehicles is essential in
improving passenger experience and supporting traffic management. Deep learning
has demonstrated outstanding performance in ATP due to its ability to model
non-linear and temporal dynamics. In the multi-step ATP, non-stationary data
will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool
heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and
a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a

feedback, closing the loop among model, tools, and environment, and implements
a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow for dynamic policy optimization. On
Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, RLFactory achieves a 0.486 test score on the Natural

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在安全性、质量和效率方面达到优越平衡，有害响应率低，用户体验干扰最小，同时保持高响应质量

Conclusion: CARE框架通过精确干预、及时纠正和有效自校正，实现了解码时安全对齐的优越安全-质量权衡

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

Conclusion: FediLoRA通过创新的聚合和编辑机制，有效解决了联邦多模态学习中的异构性和模态缺失问题，提升了模型性能

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

### [123] [Benchmarking Vision Transformers and CNNs for Thermal Photovoltaic Fault Detection with Explainable AI Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07039)
*Serra Aksoy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统比较了CNN和视觉Transformer在光伏热故障检测中的性能，利用XRAI显著性分析验证模型决策与热物理原理的一致性，以解决AI部署中的可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光伏监测中的AI部署遇到可解释性障碍，虽然深度学习在热故障检测中达到高准确度，但模型决策是否符合热物理原理缺乏验证，导致在需要理解模型推理过程的能源基础设施应用中出现部署疑虑。

Method: 系统比较卷积神经网络（ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0）和视觉Transformer（ViT-Tiny、Swin-Tiny）在热光伏故障检测中的性能，使用XRAI显著性分析评估模型与热物理原理的一致性，基于20,000张红外图像进行评估。

Result: Swin Transformer达到最高性能（94%二元准确率；73%多类别准确率）。XRAI分析显示模型学习到了物理意义特征，如局部热点、线性热道和热边界等，与预期热签名一致。但性能在不同故障类型间差异显著：电气故障检测强劲（F1分数>0.90），而环境因素如污染仍靠成挑战（F1分数0.20-0.33）。

Conclusion: 热物理导向的可解释性方法为验证能源监测应用中的AI决策提供了方法论，解决了可再生能源基础设施中的部署障碍。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

*Sergey Pozdnyakov,Philippe Schwaller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出lookup multivariate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs)作为线性层的替代方案，通过可训练低维多元函数实现高维映射，显著提升计算效率与容量的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习模型中，高维线性映射(线性层)占据了大部分参数数量和计算成本，需要寻找更高效的替代方案

Method: 使用可训练的低维多元函数表达高维映射，这些函数通过样条查找表实现，每个函数包含数十到数百个可训练参数但只需少量乘法计算

Result: lmKANs在推理FLOPs上减少高达6.0倍，在同等精度下H100吞吐量提升10倍以上，在CNN框架中CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1k数据集上分别减少1.6-2.1倍和1.7倍推理FLOPs

Conclusion: lmKANs提供了一种高效的线性层替代方案，在保持模型灵活性的同时显著降低了计算成本，适用于各种深度学习架构

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal
accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs
cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10
and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA
kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.

TL;DR: GyroBN是一个基于陀螺群结构的黎曼批量归一化框架，将欧几里得归一化层扩展到非欧几里得流形数据上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统欧几里得归一化层不适用于流形数据，而许多机器学习中的黎曼流形具有陀螺结构，需要一种理论保证的黎曼批量归一化方法

Method: 提出了GyroBN框架，建立了伪约简和陀螺等距陀螺两个必要条件来保证样本统计的理论控制，并在七个代表性几何结构上实例化

Result: 实验证明GyroBN在包括Grassmann流形、常曲率空间和相关流形等多种几何结构上都有效

Conclusion: GyroBN提供了一个统一的黎曼批量归一化框架，涵盖了现有方法作为特例，并在多种几何结构上展现出有效性

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at
https://github.com/GitZH-Chen/GyroBN.git.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabGFM将图学习问题重新表述为表格问题，通过特征和结构编码器将图转换为表格，使用多个表格基础模型进行零样本节点分类，并通过集成选择聚合结果，在28个真实数据集上取得了优于专用GNN和最先进图基础模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图基础模型(GFMs)在代表性不足的数据集上训练，泛化性能有限。而表格基础模型(TFMs)不仅在表格预测任务中表现出色，还在时间序列、NLP和CV等领域展现了强大的适用性，这启发了将节点分类重新表述为表格问题的思路。

Method: 1) 通过特征和结构编码器将图转换为表格（节点作为行，特征、结构和标签信息作为列）
2) 使用多个TFMs对多样采样的表格进行零样本节点分类
3) 通过集成选择聚合不同TFMs的输出结果

Result: 在28个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，TabGFM相比任务专用GNNs和最先进的GFMs取得了持续的性能提升

Conclusion: 表格化重构为可扩展和可泛化的图学习提供了有前景的新途径，证明了TFMs在图学习领域的强大潜力

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

### [127] [Measuring Uncertainty in Transformer Circuits with Effective Information Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07149)
*Anatoly A. Krasnovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EICS的新指标，用于量化Transformer电路中功能子图的行为一致性和可信度，结合了层析不一致性和因果涌现的测量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏形式化的单次通过方法来量化Transformer电路中活跃子图的行为一致性和可信度，需要一种能够评估电路是否连贯运作的指标。

Method: 基于系统理论和层析/上同调理论，提出了EICS评分，结合了从局部Jacobian和激活计算的归一化层析不一致性，以及从相同前向状态推导的电路级因果涌现的高斯EI代理。

Result: 构建了一个白盒、单次通过的评估框架，使评分无量纲化，并提供了评分解释、计算开销（快速和精确模式）以及玩具验证分析的实用指导。

Conclusion: EICS为评估Transformer电路的行为一致性和可信度提供了一个形式化的量化工具，但实证验证仍需在LLM任务上进行。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

TL;DR: PLaID++是一个基于大语言模型的晶体结构生成方法，通过Wyckoff文本表示和强化学习技术，显著提高了稳定、新颖晶体的生成效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统材料发现过程缓慢且昂贵，需要加速新材料开发流程，特别是太阳能电池、电池和碳捕获等领域的新材料发现

Method: 微调Qwen-2.5 7B模型，使用基于Wyckoff的文本表示生成晶体结构，采用基于直接偏好优化(DPO)的强化学习技术来引导生成过程

Result: 相比先前方法，PLaID++生成热力学稳定、独特且新颖结构的成功率提高约50%，在无条件和空间群条件生成方面分别实现约115%和50%的改进

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了将自然语言处理的后训练技术应用于材料设计的潜力，为靶向高效发现新材料铺平了道路

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted
and efficient discovery of novel materials.

TL;DR: Fed-REACT是一个针对异构和动态演化客户端数据的联邦学习框架，通过表示学习和进化聚类两阶段方法提升模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中客户端数据分布随时间演化且差异显著导致的异构性问题，避免集中式机器学习的高资源成本和隐私问题

Method: 两阶段过程：1) 客户端本地学习模型提取特征表示；2) 服务器基于表示动态聚类客户端，协调集群级任务特定模型训练

Result: 理论分析了表示学习阶段，实证表明Fed-REACT在真实数据集上实现了优越的准确性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: Fed-REACT有效解决了联邦学习中的异构数据演化问题，为下游分类和回归任务提供了高性能解决方案

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in
treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use
has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine
learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested
pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using
sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can
include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting
model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across
human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach
can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on
predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug
embeddings.

Motivation: 研究发现后训练量化(PTQ)虽然具有高压缩能力和速度，但会加剧模型对不同群体的不公平影响，特别是对少数群体的准确率影响更大，这阻碍了量化神经网络在公平部署中的应用。

Method: 分析量化过程中权重和激活值变化对网络性能的影响机制，研究梯度范数和Hessian矩阵特征值的变化，提出结合混合精度量化感知训练(QAT)、数据集采样方法和加权损失函数的综合解决方案。

Result: 量化导致logits方差降低、损失增加和群体准确率受损，研究发现量化对少数群体的影响更为显著，通过梯度范数和Hessian矩阵分析揭示了网络优化状态的变化。

Conclusion: 量化会加剧模型的不公平性，但通过集成混合精度QAT、数据集采样和加权损失函数的方法，可以有效缓解量化带来的不公平影响，实现量化神经网络的公平部署。

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

as well as performance. A holistically optimized framework is introduced for
five state-of-the-art models on mathematical reasoning tasks, exhibiting
significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through
systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are
demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an

optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced
reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising
accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B
delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate

Conclusion: IP-Basis PINNs为多查询反问题提供了高效解决方案，显著降低计算成本并保持性能，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is
computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of
observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

Method: 结合PCGrad原理、梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制，提出Gradient Conductor (GCond)方法，包括随机模式实现计算加速。

Result: 在ImageNet 1K和头颈CT扫描数据集上，GCond在所有评估指标上表现优异，L1和SSIM损失更低，对MobileNetV3-Small和ConvNeXt等架构都表现出高可扩展性，且与AdamW、Lion/LARS等现代优化器兼容。

Conclusion: GCond为多任务学习中的梯度冲突问题提供了一个可扩展且高效的解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

*Jeff Shen,Lindsay Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ALICE架构，一个简单的仅编码器Transformer，在密码破解任务上实现了新的最先进准确率和速度，仅需训练约1500个密码就能泛化到未见过的密码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将密码破解作为研究神经网络在组合复杂领域中泛化能力的理想测试平台，该任务需要从26!种可能的映射中选择正确的替换密码。

Method: 开发了ALICE架构，使用仅编码器Transformer和新型双射解码头，通过Gumbel-Sinkhorn方法显式建模排列，可直接提取学习到的密码映射。

Result: ALICE在仅训练约1500个唯一密码（占可能密码空间的极小部分3.7×10^{-24}）后就能泛化到未见过的密码，并通过早期退出分析揭示了模型预测逐步细化的过程。

Conclusion: 该架构创新和分析方法可扩展到任何具有双射映射和组合结构的领域，为神经网络泛化能力和可解释性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将复杂患者情况转化为指南合规治疗推荐耗时且易错，需要利用LLM能力来减少时间成本并提高准确性。

Method: 构建121例NSCLC患者纵向数据集，采用混合方法结合专家标注和模型一致性信息，开发预测相关指南的智能体框架和验证预测准确性的元分类器。

Result: LLM具有领域专业知识，代理基准生成与专家标注强相关（Spearman系数r=0.88，RMSE=0.08），治疗推荐验证AUROC=0.800。

Conclusion: 建立了临床可行的LLM指南遵循系统框架，平衡准确性、可解释性和监管要求，同时降低标注成本，为自动化临床决策支持提供可扩展路径。

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based
guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into
guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires
specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model
(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment
recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to
automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

TL;DR: 提出了一个通用人口统计预训练模型(GDP)，专门针对年龄和性别特征进行表示学习，通过顺序排序和编码方法提升医疗预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的人口统计属性是重要的临床预测因子，但在模型设计中常被忽视，缺乏专门的表示学习方法

Method: 开发GDP预训练框架，探索不同排序策略和编码方法，将表格化人口统计数据转换为潜在嵌入表示，并在多疾病数据集上预训练评估

Result: 顺序排序显著提升模型在判别、校准和信息增益方面的性能，特别是在人口统计属性重要的疾病中，即使预测价值较低的数据集也能增强表示重要性

Conclusion: 表格化人口统计属性的基础模型可以跨任务和人群泛化，为提升医疗预测性能提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

Motivation: 解决联邦边缘学习中客户端数据随时间变化且非独立同分布的挑战，需要及时高效地适应动态数据演化

Method: 提出时间漂移和集体发散量化方法，使用Earth Mover's Distance表示分类任务的类别分布，开发联合调度和带宽分配算法

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上相比随机调度分别提高了58.4%和49.2%的收敛速度，获得了更高的测试精度

Conclusion: FedTeddi算法能够有效处理动态数据演化，在通信资源限制下实现快速收敛，同时避免遗忘先前知识

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients over wireless networks without exposing raw data. While
most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

TL;DR: SBS是一种参数高效的神经表示增强方法，通过抑制频谱偏差来改进神经网络权重的压缩重建效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的隐式神经表示存在明显的频谱偏差，难以有效重建高频细节，限制了神经网络权重压缩的性能

Method: 提出两种技术：1)基于单向排序的平滑化改进输出空间核平滑度；2)基于单向排序平滑感知的随机傅里叶特征，根据层间参数数量自适应调节输入编码的频率带宽

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上的ResNet模型评估显示，SBS以更少的参数实现了显著更好的重建精度

Conclusion: SBS通过抑制频谱偏差有效提升了神经网络权重的压缩重建性能，在参数效率方面优于现有最佳方法

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

Abstract: Cardiac arrest is one of the biggest global health problems, and early

this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection

creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

equipped with an additional powerful feature to learn the outlier
characteristics during inference along with outlier-detection, EMORF-II has
improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm
performance gains as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
accuracy with an increased computational overhead. However, thankfully the
computational complexity order remains at par with other practical methods
making it a useful choice for diverse applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DPH-RL框架，通过使用mass-covering f-divergences（如前向KL和JS散度）作为排练机制，解决RLVR微调中多尝试性能退化的问题，同时保持模型的知识多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RLVR微调LLMs时，尽管单次尝试准确率（Pass@1）提升，但多次尝试性能（Pass@k）经常退化，并伴随灾难性遗忘。现有方法缺乏对散度项选择和功能的系统研究。

Method: 提出DPH-RL框架，使用mass-covering f-divergences（如前向KL和JS散度）作为排练机制，持续参考初始策略，强制模型保持广泛的解决方案覆盖范围。

Result: 在数学和SQL生成任务上的实验表明，DPH-RL不仅解决了Pass@k退化问题，还提高了域内和域外的Pass@1和Pass@k性能，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 散度度量的正确选择是改进RLVR的关键因素，DPH-RL通过保持多样性构建了更通用和多样化的推理模型。

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

Result: 在多个真实数据集上实现了隐式和显式反馈预测任务的最先进性能，单个模型即可处理两种任务，并提供额外的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅性能优越，还提供了理论保证（泛化边界和损失函数优化保证），能够识别用户可能不会自然消费但会喜欢的物品，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite
relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional
interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of
each possible rating.

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

Conclusion: RoseCDL为现实世界信号中的事件发现和表征提供了一个实用的CDL框架，解决了传统方法在罕见事件检测中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

Motivation: RLVR在提升大语言模型推理能力方面显示出强大潜力，但训练过程中响应长度的巨大变异性导致高梯度方差和不稳定优化，现有方法存在估计偏差或梯度方差高的问题。

Method: 通过理论分析不同长度对策略损失的影响，将问题重新表述为寻找最小方差无偏估计量，提出ΔL归一化方法，提供无偏策略损失估计并理论上最小化梯度方差。

Conclusion: ΔL归一化是一种简单有效的损失聚合方法，成功解决了RLVR中的长度变异性问题，提供了理论保证的优化稳定性。

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

Conclusion: uGMM-NN为将不确定性感知组件集成到现代神经架构中提供了基础，为判别性和生成性建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network
(uGMM-NN), a novel neural architecture that embeds probabilistic reasoning
directly into the computational units of deep networks. Unlike traditional
neurons, which apply weighted sums followed by fixed nonlinearities, each
uGMM-NN node parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture,
with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients. This design enables
richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework
provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern
neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and
generative modeling.

Conclusion: 双重公式化可作为收敛质量的可靠指标，其集成到PINN框架中增强了在微力学均匀化问题中的适用性

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy
for optimizing the placement of sensors aiming at structural health monitoring
of semiconductor probe cards. Failures in probe cards, including substrate
cracks and loosened screws, would critically affect semiconductor manufacturing
yield and reliability. Some failure modes could be detected by equipping a
probe card with adequate sensors. Frequency response functions from simulated
failure scenarios are adopted within a finite element model of a probe card. A
comprehensive dataset, enriched by physics-informed scenario expansion and
physics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid
Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high
accuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose
screw, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model
robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints
critical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers
actionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems
by optimizing sensor configurations. This research highlights the capability of
attention-based deep learning to advance proactive maintenance, enhancing
operational reliability and yield in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

Conclusion: 该方法成功桥接了高速度和高质量之间的间隔，为交互式数据可视化提供了新的解决方案，且可扩展到更多机器学习应用场景

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

TL;DR: IBN网络通过不确定性感知插值和双向建模，解决了多元时间序列预测中变量缺失问题，在多种缺失率场景下达到最先进性能


<details>

Motivation: 传统时空图神经网络在处理缺失变量时难以建模变量间相关性，现有方法GinAR缺乏可解释性且无法捕捉潜在时间模式

Method: 集成不确定性感知插值(UAI)和高斯核图卷积(GGCN)，使用MC Dropout估计重建值不确定性，双向递归单元增强时间依赖建模

Result: 在多种缺失率场景下实现了最先进的预测性能

Conclusion: IBN为缺失变量的多元时间序列预测提供了更可靠和可解释的框架

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

Motivation: MoE模型在有限GPU内存下的高效服务面临挑战，需要探索压缩专家数据的方法并分析压缩误差对推理性能的影响。

Method: 采用误差有界压缩算法（如SZ3和CuSZp）压缩非激活专家，通过大量实验分析不同层级专家的压缩误差对推理精度的影响。

Result: 浅层专家（负责注意力机制和输入转换）对压缩误差不敏感；中层专家（核心推理）误差显著降低精度；深层专家（指令跟随和输出整合）的有界误差有时能提升精度。

Conclusion: 误差有界压缩是有效的MoE模型服务优化方法，不同层级专家对压缩误差的敏感度不同，需要分层处理压缩策略。

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

Abstract: Predicting injuries and fatalities in traffic crashes plays a critical role
in enhancing road safety, improving emergency response, and guiding public
health interventions. This study investigates the added value of unstructured
crash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with
structured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the
narratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of
class imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to
the training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from
Kentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three
road classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes
(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four
broader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and
(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning
models were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based
features using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:
XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models
incorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on
structured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded
the most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the
power of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance
person-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable
framework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity
modeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures.

Result: 在大规模药物组合数据集上的回顾性模拟显示，该方法显著提高了初始筛选效率，较基线方法有显著改善

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化联合药物筛选提供了可行的早期决策路径，通过利用历史数据和深度学习模型有效解决了冷启动问题

Abstract: Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains
largely infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in
patient-derived models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the
number of feasible experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window
makes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a
means of guiding drug response prediction. This leads to a challenging
cold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test
early, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a
strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical
drug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations
and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial
experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug
combination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial
screening efficiency compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more
effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens.

Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR)
is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals.
Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression
models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a
multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV
change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was
analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.
Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time
points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking
criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using
the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error
(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate
the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,
dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.
Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy
relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves
an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows
promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a
more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and
treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which
are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep
laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home
environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep
onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.
automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent
research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for
various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive
sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel
in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a
wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:
24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse)
as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground
truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep
staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake
vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the
potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep
monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

Conclusion: 模块化设计允许灵活替换组件以适应动态环境，并能整合来自多个预测器的辅助知识，为在线凸凹优化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Online Convex-Concave Optimization,
which extends Online Convex Optimization to two-player time-varying
convex-concave games. The goal is to minimize the dynamic duality gap (D-DGap),
a critical performance measure that evaluates players' strategies against
arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal
performance, particularly in stationary or predictable environments. To address
this, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an
Adaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,
a Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple
candidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their
strengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a
logarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.
The modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that
regulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of
components that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.
Empirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs and ontologies represent entities and their relationships in
a structured way, having gained significance in the development of modern AI
applications. Integrating these semantic resources with machine learning models
often relies on knowledge graph embedding models to transform graph data into
numerical representations. Therefore, pre-trained models for popular knowledge
graphs and ontologies are increasingly valuable, as they spare the need to
retrain models for different tasks using the same data, thereby helping to
democratize AI development and enabling sustainable computing.
  In this paper, we present Bio-KGvec2go, an extension of the KGvec2go Web API,
designed to generate and serve knowledge graph embeddings for widely used
biomedical ontologies. Given the dynamic nature of these ontologies,
Bio-KGvec2go also supports regular updates aligned with ontology version
releases. By offering up-to-date embeddings with minimal computational effort
required from users, Bio-KGvec2go facilitates efficient and timely biomedical
research.

Motivation: 由于大语言模型训练成本高昂，传统的试错方法不可行，需要寻找更有效的方法来发现指导模型构建的缩放定律

Method: 借鉴逆问题在揭示基础科学定律方面的成功经验，将逆问题方法应用于发现LLM的缩放定律

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this
position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover
scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable
performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

Conclusion: ScaleZero展示了在大规模多任务学习中有效平衡性能和效率的潜力，为异构多任务学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际教育场景中存在隐私法规、数据孤岛和领域特定数据穷乏等挑战，限制了多模态多任务基础模型的部署。

Method: 结合联邦学习(FL)与M3T基础模型，在分布式机构中进行协作性隐私保护训练，同时支持多模态和多任务。

Result: 提出了M3T FedFMs方案，能够提升智能教育系统的三大关键支架：隐私保护、个性化和公平包容性。

Conclusion: M3T FedFMs是一个有前景但待深入探索的方向，需要解决异构隐私法规、数据特性不均匀、去学习、持续学习和模型可解释性等挑战。

Abstract: Multi-modal multi-task (M3T) foundation models (FMs) have recently shown
transformative potential in artificial intelligence, with emerging applications
in education. However, their deployment in real-world educational settings is
hindered by privacy regulations, data silos, and limited domain-specific data
availability. We introduce M3T Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) for
education: a paradigm that integrates federated learning (FL) with M3T FMs to
enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized
institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently,
this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored
approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its
related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three
critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy
preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research
challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy
regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning
frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must
be collectively addressed for practical deployment.

TL;DR: ACE方法通过自训练学习一致性概念来解决完全伪相关性问题，在多个基准测试中表现优异，并在语言模型对齐中展现潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对伪相关性敏感，现有方法主要处理不完全伪相关，但完全伪相关情况下的正确泛化是根本未指定的，需要新方法来解决

Method: 提出ACE方法，学习一组与训练数据一致但在未标记新输入上做出不同预测的概念，采用自训练方法鼓励自信和选择性分歧

Result: ACE在完全伪相关基准测试中匹配或优于现有方法，同时对不完全伪相关保持鲁棒性，在语言模型对齐中无需访问不可信测量即可实现竞争性性能

Conclusion: ACE在克服未指定问题方面取得重要进展，虽然仍有局限性，但为处理完全伪相关问题提供了更可配置和有效的方法

Abstract: Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

TL;DR: 提出了基于Block Tensor-Train和Multi-Level Low Rank矩阵的新注意力评分函数，解决了标准注意力在信息损失和距离依赖性方面的不足，在多个任务上表现优于标准注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制的低维投影会导致信息损失，且对所有输入对使用相同的评分函数，缺乏对序列中相邻token的距离依赖性计算偏置。

Method: 提出了基于计算高效结构化矩阵的新评分函数，包括Block Tensor-Train (BTT)和Multi-Level Low Rank (MLR)矩阵，这些矩阵具有高秩并能编码距离依赖性计算偏置。

Result: 在高维输入的上下文回归任务中，新评分函数在任何固定计算预算下都优于标准注意力；在语言建模任务中，MLR注意力相比标准注意力和滑动窗口注意力变体实现了更好的扩展规律；MLR注意力在长程时间序列预测中也表现出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: BTT和MLR属于能够编码全秩或距离依赖性计算偏置的高效结构化矩阵家族，有效解决了标准注意力的显著缺陷。

Abstract: The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the
inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each
pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes
information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional
inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input
pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring
tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by
proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured
matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level
Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional
inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any
fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality
patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws
compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of
efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or
distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings
of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising
results for long-range time-series forecasting.

Method: 提出新的广义平滑性假设家族，在确定性和随机设置下研究梯度下降的收敛特性，理论验证预热策略的有效性

Result: 学习率预热能持续加速梯度下降，在某些特定情况下比非递增学习率调度快Θ(T)倍收敛

Conclusion: 学习率预热策略具有理论优势，能显著提升训练效率，为实践应用提供了优化理论基础

Abstract: Learning rate warmup is a popular and practical technique in training
large-scale deep neural networks. Despite the huge success in practice, the
theoretical advantages of this strategy of gradually increasing the learning
rate at the beginning of the training process have not been fully understood.
To resolve this gap between theory and practice, we first propose a novel
family of generalized smoothness assumptions, and validate its applicability
both theoretically and empirically. Under the novel smoothness assumption, we
study the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. It is shown that learning rate warmup consistently
accelerates GD, and GD with warmup can converge at most $\Theta(T)$ times
faster than with a non-increasing learning rate schedule in some specific
cases, providing insights into the benefits of this strategy from an
optimization theory perspective.
