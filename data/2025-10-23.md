TL;DR: PICK是一个用于心理图像理解的多步骤框架，通过层次分析和知识注入，将多模态大语言模型应用于房树人测试等心理评估任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在客观多模态感知任务中表现出色，但在主观情感领域如心理分析中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 将包含多个实例的绘图分解为语义子图，构建层次表示；分析各层次子图提取心理洞察；引入房树人知识库和特征提取模块生成心理档案；整合多源信息生成专家级评估。

Result: 实验结果表明PICK显著提升了多模态大语言模型在心理分析中的能力，并通过情感理解任务的扩展验证了其通用性。

Conclusion: PICK弥合了多模态大语言模型与专业领域之间的差距，为通过视觉表达理解人类心理状态提供了结构化且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大规模视觉语言模型的时间感知能力，提出了TIME10k基准数据集，发现时间信息在VLM嵌入空间中沿着低维非线性流形结构化，并提出了从嵌入空间提取显式时间线表示的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型的时间感知能力，评估它们将视觉内容定位在时间上的能力，这对于理解模型的时空推理能力很重要。

Method: 提出了TIME10k基准数据集（包含10,000多张带时间标注的图像），评估了37个VLM的时间感知能力，并基于发现的时间信息结构化特征，提出了从嵌入空间提取显式时间线表示的方法。

Result: 发现时间信息在VLM嵌入空间中沿着低维非线性流形结构化，提出的时间线方法在时间推理任务中达到了与基于提示的基线方法相当或更优的准确率，同时计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型具有内在的时间感知能力，时间信息在其嵌入空间中有特定的结构化表示，提出的时间线方法能够有效支持时间推理任务。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at
https://tekayanidham.github.io/timeline-page/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文综述了遥感数据中维度约简技术的应用，重点介绍了特征提取方法如何解决高维数据带来的挑战，并为遥感数据价值链中的维度约简应用提供了指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据量日益增长，但高维度数据带来了稀疏性、低效率和维度灾难等问题，限制了机器学习模型的有效性。需要维度约简技术来解决这些挑战，以支持环境监测、城市规划、灾害管理等重要应用。

Method: 采用综述方法，系统分析了维度约简技术（特别是特征提取方法）在遥感数据价值链中的应用，包括数据压缩、清洗、融合、可视化、异常检测和预测等任务。

Result: 提供了遥感数据中维度约简技术的全面指南，识别了未被充分探索的维度约简算法及其在未来研究中的应用机会。

Conclusion: 维度约简技术对于处理遥感高维数据至关重要，能够保持数据本质特性的同时降低复杂度，为未来研究提供了重要的应用方向和发展机会。

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [4] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ninja Codes是一种神经生成的基准标记，能够自然地融入现实环境，通过神经网络对图像进行视觉上细微的修改，创建出隐蔽的6自由度位置跟踪标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准标记在视觉上过于显眼，在需要美观或其他原因的场景中不受欢迎。本文旨在开发一种能够隐蔽地融入环境的基准标记系统。

Method: 采用端到端的深度隐写术方法，联合训练一系列网络模块来创建和检测Ninja Codes。编码器网络将任意图像转换为Ninja Codes，通过视觉上细微的修改实现隐蔽性。

Result: 实验表明Ninja Codes在常见室内光照条件下能够提供可靠的位置跟踪，同时成功隐藏在各种环境纹理中。可以使用普通彩色打印机在常规打印纸上制作。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在增强现实、机器人技术、运动用户界面等应用中具有重要价值，特别是在传统基准标记因外观显眼而不适用的场景中。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [5] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段的自动驾驶视觉语言问答系统，通过精心设计的提示和上下文增强，显著提升了高级感知、预测和规划问题的回答准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决自动驾驶中高级感知、预测和规划问题的问答需求，利用预训练视觉语言模型但需要改进其在该领域的表现。

Method: 第一阶段使用Qwen2.5-VL-32B模型，结合六摄像头输入、历史时间窗口和思维链提示；第二阶段增加场景元数据和任务特定指令，采用自一致性集成提高可靠性。

Result: 在驾驶QA基准测试中，第一阶段达到65.1%准确率，自一致性提升至66.85%；第二阶段达到67.37%总体准确率，在严重视觉损坏下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示和上下文增强可以显著提升预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [6] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D模型，用于解决纵向医学影像分析中高分辨率图像序列和不规则时间间隔的建模挑战，在乳腺癌风险预测中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法充分利用纵向医学影像中的空间和时间信息，要么压缩空间信息为向量，要么使用计算效率低且不兼容非均匀时间步长的时空模型。

Method: 采用状态空间架构，包含连续时间选择性扫描机制（整合真实时间间隔）和多尺度3D邻域融合模块（捕获时空关系），具有线性计算复杂度。

Result: 在乳腺癌风险预测基准测试中，验证c-index提高2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC得分高于现有循环、transformer和状态空间模型变体。

Conclusion: 该模型能高效处理长而复杂的乳腺筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种运动中心对齐框架，通过从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间来改进文本到视频扩散模型，使其生成更符合物理常识和时间一致性的视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频扩散模型在生成复杂运动时往往缺乏时间一致性和物理合理性，原因是模型对视频中复杂运动的理解不足。现有方法通过对齐扩散模型与预训练视频编码器的特征来改进，但这些编码器的特征混合了视频外观和动态，限制了改进效果。

Method: 提出运动中心对齐框架：1）从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间，该子空间通过预测真实光流进行优化以确保捕获真实运动动态；2）将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征对齐到这个新的运动子空间，使生成模型能够内化运动知识。

Result: 该方法在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0等基准测试上改进了最先进视频扩散模型的物理常识性，同时保持了与文本提示的匹配度，用户研究也证实了改进效果。

Conclusion: 通过解耦运动子空间的对齐方法，能够有效提升文本到视频扩散模型生成视频的物理合理性和时间一致性，同时不损害文本条件生成的质量。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [8] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述的评估指标，使用场景图作为结构化评分标准来指导LLMs作为评判者，产生基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。该方法在DOCENT新数据集上比现有指标更好地与人类评分相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本的详细图像描述，缺乏对属性和关系附件的敏感性，以及将错误定位到特定文本片段的能力。

Method: PoSh使用场景图作为结构化评分标准，指导大型语言模型作为评判者，产生基于细粒度错误（如组合理解错误）的聚合分数。同时引入了DOCENT新数据集，包含艺术品、专家撰写的参考描述和模型生成的描述，以及艺术史学生的质量判断。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上与人类判断的相关性比最佳开源替代方案强0.05 Spearman ρ，对图像类型具有鲁棒性，并且能够作为有效的奖励函数，优于标准监督微调。

Conclusion: PoSh和DOCENT为详细图像描述提供了更好的评估框架，发现基础模型在描述具有丰富场景动态的图像时难以实现完整、无错误的覆盖，这为衡量VLM进展建立了一个具有挑战性的新任务。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

TL;DR: 提出UniHPR统一人体姿态表示学习框架，通过新颖的基于奇异值的对比学习损失对齐图像、2D和3D人体姿态表示，在Human3.6M和3DPW数据集上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对人体姿态多种表示形式（图像、2D关键点、3D骨架等）之间相关性的系统性研究，特别是在对比学习范式下的对齐研究。

Method: 提出UniHPR框架，使用基于奇异值的对比学习损失来同时对齐多种人体姿态表示，包括图像、2D和3D姿态。

Result: 在Human3.6M数据集上MPJPE达到49.9mm，在3DPW数据集上PA-MPJPE达到51.6mm，并在Human3.6M数据集上实现姿态检索，检索误差为9.24mm。

Conclusion: UniHPR能够有效对齐多种人体姿态表示，在2D和3D人体姿态估计任务中表现出色，并支持跨模态姿态检索。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准U-Net模型在脑肿瘤分割中面临挑战，特别是在处理不规则形状和模糊边界时准确性不足，且高分辨率MRI数据训练需要大量计算资源并存在类别不平衡问题。

Method: 将注意力机制集成到3D U-Net模型中，使模型能够捕捉复杂细节并优先处理信息丰富的区域；同时使用基于数字图像处理的肿瘤检测算法来解决训练数据不平衡问题。

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

TL;DR: 该研究应用联邦近端学习(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据，结合改进的U-Net模型和注意力机制，实现了96%的肿瘤分割准确率，同时保护患者隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球女性主要死因，需要早期检测和准确诊断。超声成像作为可靠且经济有效的工具，但医疗数据的敏感性使得开发准确且私密的AI模型具有挑战性。联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但在非独立同分布数据上训练会影响模型准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 应用联邦近端(FedProx)方法处理非独立同分布的超声乳腺癌图像数据集，并采用改进的U-Net模型结合注意力机制来增强肿瘤分割准确性。

Result: 该方法训练出的全局模型达到了96%的准确率，有效提高了肿瘤分割准确性，同时保护了患者隐私。

Conclusion: FedProx方法在非独立同分布的本地医疗数据集上训练精确机器学习模型具有良好潜力。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和CECL方法，用于从第一人称视角研究多智能体决策和团队战术学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖第三人称视角，忽略了多智能体学习的同步自我中心特性，需要从个体视角理解团队战术

Method: 构建X-Ego-CS数据集（124小时专业比赛录像），提出跨自我中心对比学习（CECL）方法，对齐队友的第一人称视觉流

Result: CECL在队友-对手位置预测任务中表现出色，能有效从单一第一人称视角推断队友和对手位置

Conclusion: 为电子竞技中的跨自我中心多智能体基准测试奠定基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

Abstract: We propose FootFormer, a cross-modality approach for jointly predicting human
motion dynamics directly from visual input. On multiple datasets, FootFormer
achieves statistically significantly better or equivalent estimates of foot
pressure distributions, foot contact maps, and center of mass (CoM), as

Furthermore, FootFormer achieves SOTA performance in estimating

### [14] [Malaria Detection from Blood Cell Images Using XceptionNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19182)
*Warisa Nusrat,Mostafijur Rahman,Ayatullah Faruk Mollah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文应用六种深度卷积网络（AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、Residual Attention Network、DenseNet-121和Custom-CNN）对疟疾细胞图像进行分类，其中Residual Attention Network和XceptionNet表现最佳，准确率分别达到97.28%和97.55%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疟疾诊断依赖专家手动观察血涂片图像，缺乏专业知识技能和人工操作可能导致误诊，因此需要计算机辅助的自动诊断方法。

Method: 使用六种深度卷积网络从血细胞图像中提取深层特征，并分类为疟疾感染细胞或健康细胞。

Result: Residual Attention Network和XceptionNet在公开疟疾细胞图像数据集上表现最优，平均准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，优于其他相关方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的方法能够实现疟疾的自动可靠检测，同时最小化直接人工参与，具有现实应用前景。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PruneHal是一种无需训练的方法，通过自适应KV缓存修剪来增强MLLMs对关键视觉信息的关注，从而缓解幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案要么引入额外数据进行训练，要么在推理时加入外部或内部信息，这些方法都会带来额外计算成本。研究发现MLLMs中的幻觉与对视觉token的注意力不足密切相关。

Method: 提出PruneHal方法，利用自适应KV缓存修剪来增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注，无需额外训练，几乎不增加推理成本。

Result: 在多个主流MLLMs和广泛使用的幻觉评估基准上取得了稳健且出色的结果。

Conclusion: PruneHal是第一个将token修剪应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，具有模型无关性，可无缝集成到不同的解码策略中。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Video Consistency Distance (VCD)指标，通过基于奖励的微调框架提升视频扩散模型的时序一致性，特别是在图像到视频生成任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的奖励函数主要关注整个生成视频序列的质量，但在图像到视频生成任务中，时序一致性往往受到影响，需要专门针对时序一致性的改进方法。

Method: 在视频帧特征的频域空间中定义VCD指标，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧间信息，并将其集成到基于奖励的微调框架中。

Result: 在多个图像到视频数据集上的实验结果表明，使用VCD微调的视频生成模型显著提升了时序一致性，且不降低其他性能指标。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的时序一致性度量方法，能够在不牺牲其他质量指标的前提下，显著改善视频生成模型的时序连贯性。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive是一个用于自动驾驶感知任务增强的合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知引导图和3D资产渲染生成多视角逼真视频，显著提升角案例感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽视了对于自动驾驶性能至关重要的下游感知任务评估。现有方法需要先在合成数据上预训练再在真实数据上微调，导致训练周期加倍，当基线方法也加倍训练周期时，合成数据的优势变得不明显。

Method: Dream4Drive首先将输入视频分解为多个3D感知引导图，然后将3D资产渲染到这些引导图上，最后微调驾驶世界模型生成编辑后的多视角逼真视频，用于训练下游感知模型。

Result: 该框架能够大规模生成多视角角案例，显著提升自动驾驶中的角案例感知能力。实验表明Dream4Drive在不同训练周期下都能有效提升下游感知模型的性能。

Conclusion: Dream4Drive通过创新的合成数据生成方法，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了前所未有的灵活性，特别是在角案例生成方面，为未来研究提供了重要价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景下表现不一致，缺乏能有效处理所有动态挑战的统一方法。

Method: 使用专家混合框架，通过体积感知像素路由器将体积高斯级权重投影到像素空间，实现专家输出的自适应混合，并采用单次多专家渲染、门控感知高斯剪枝和蒸馏策略优化效率。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的实验表明，MoE-GS在保持效率的同时持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: MoE-GS是将专家混合技术首次引入动态高斯溅射的成功尝试，提供了统一且高效的动态场景重建解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

TL;DR: SFGFusion是一种基于表面拟合的相机-4D成像雷达检测网络，通过估计物体二次表面参数来增强空间表示和跨模态交互，生成密集伪点云缓解雷达点稀疏问题，在BEV空间实现多模态融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D成像雷达具有低成本、远距离检测和准确速度测量等优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示和多模态融合效果。

Method: 通过图像和雷达数据估计物体二次表面参数，生成密集深度图；在图像分支中指导特征从透视视图转换到BEV空间；在表面伪点分支生成密集伪点云；两个点云分支采用基于pillar的方法转换到BEV空间；使用标准2D骨干网络和检测头进行目标检测。

Result: 在TJ4DRadSet和view-of-delft (VoD)目标检测基准测试中取得了优越性能，有效融合了相机和4D雷达特征。

Conclusion: SFGFusion通过表面拟合指导的多模态融合方法，成功解决了4D成像雷达点云稀疏的问题，实现了更可靠的密集深度预测和准确的目标检测。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决GEO空间目标检测中的挑战，通过小波变换和时序轨迹补全实现了高精度的目标检测。

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作感知中带宽限制问题，传统方法只传输前景特征而丢弃了包含重要上下文的背景信息，限制了感知性能

Method: 采用课程学习策略，早期利用背景线索但逐步剪除，迫使模型将上下文信息内化到前景表示中，而无需传输背景本身

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试中，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均优于现有方法

Conclusion: 上下文丰富的前景共享方法在协作感知中有效，能够在不传输背景的情况下提升感知性能

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Conclusion: MobiAct框架成功实现了低能耗、低计算量的MAV动作识别，在保持高准确率的同时显著提升了推理效率

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

TL;DR: 提出D2D框架，将不可微的检测模型转化为可微的批评器，利用其优越的计数能力来指导文本到图像生成模型生成正确数量的对象。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在语义对齐方面表现良好，但在生成提示中指定数量的对象时仍存在困难。现有方法通常使用可微的回归模型作为外部批评器，但排除了计数能力更强的检测器模型，因为其基于枚举的计数本质是不可微的。

Method: 设计自定义激活函数将检测器logits转换为软二进制指示器，然后在推理时使用预训练的T2I模型优化噪声先验。

Result: 在SDXL-Turbo、SD-Turbo和Pixart-DMD等多个模型和四个不同复杂度的基准测试上，对象计数准确率得到一致且显著提升（例如在D2D-Small基准上提升高达13.7%），图像质量和计算开销几乎没有下降。

Conclusion: D2D框架成功地将非可微检测模型的计数能力引入到文本到图像生成中，显著改善了对象计数性能，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled

privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data
in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and
99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant
state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior
accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications
in early Alzheimer disease detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出统一强化与模仿学习(RIL)算法，通过结合强化学习和对抗模仿学习，训练轻量级视觉语言模型，使其能够模仿大型教师模型的文本生成能力并系统性提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)虽然取得了显著进展，但其大规模特性在资源受限环境中不实用，需要开发高效的训练算法来创建轻量级但性能强大的VLMs。

Method: RIL算法结合强化学习与对抗模仿学习，使用基于LLM的判别器区分学生和教师输出，并利用多个大型教师VLM提供多样化指导，形成统一学习策略。

Result: 在多样化视觉语言基准测试中，RIL显著缩小了与最先进开源和闭源VLMs的性能差距，并在多个实例中超越它们。

Conclusion: RIL通过统一强化和模仿学习，使轻量级学生模型能够实现显著性能提升，与领先的闭源VLMs具有竞争力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，能够同时从不同分辨率的遥感图像中预测水深测量和基于像素的海底分类，通过联合建模深度与海底底质和栖息地，实现协同增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法要么从遥感图像中推导深度，要么推导海底类别，这些任务被孤立处理，丧失了它们相互作用的共同好处，并阻碍了深度学习方法的更广泛采用。

Method: Seabed-Net采用双分支编码器进行水深估计和基于像素的海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块和窗口化Swin-Transformer融合块集成跨任务特征，并通过动态任务不确定性加权平衡目标。

Result: 在两个异质海岸站点的广泛评估中，Seabed-Net始终优于传统的经验模型和传统机器学习回归方法，实现了高达75%的RMSE降低。与最先进的单任务和多任务基线相比，水深RMSE降低了10-30%，海底分类准确率提高了8%。

Conclusion: 联合建模深度与海底底质和栖息地能够产生协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供了一个稳健、开放的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Conclusion: 尺度偏移领域泛化是一个新颖且具有应用价值的研究方向，本文提供了四个重要见解为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，通过将fMRI信号与CLIP中间层和最终层对齐，无需单独的VAE管道即可实现高质量的图像解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将fMRI映射到CLIP的最终语义层，忽略了CLIP中间层的丰富物体信息，且与大脑功能层次结构不符。添加VAE管道会增加大量参数。

Method: 基于人类视觉系统功能层次结构，将不同功能视觉区域的fMRI信号对齐到对应的CLIP中间层和最终层，引入跨重建策略和多粒度损失函数。

Result: 在高级语义指标上达到或超越SOTA方法性能，参数数量减少71.7%，有效捕捉CLIP-only方法常遗漏的视觉细节。

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP在语义准确性和细节保真度之间取得了良好平衡，无需单独的VAE管道，实现了参数高效的fMRI图像解码。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

Motivation: 解决开集视觉识别中需要大量标注数据和训练成本高的问题，开发无需训练即可实现语义分割和开集识别的统一框架。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1) 使用EfficientNetB0提取特征，通过SVD分解和层次聚类进行无监督分割；2) 使用CLIP的ViT编码分割区域，与文本嵌入在共享潜在空间中对齐，通过相似度计算实现识别。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了无需训练方法的有效性、灵活性和泛化能力，为开集视觉识别提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: DaMo能有效优化数据混合配置，显著提升多模态大语言模型在移动手机任务中的性能，并具有良好的泛化能力和可扩展性

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在医学图像配准中往往忽视正则化的重要性，导致缺乏鲁棒性和解剖合理性。需要一种能够动态调整正则化、防止非物理伪影的配准方法。

Method: 提出DARE框架，基于变形场梯度范数动态调整弹性正则化，集成应变和剪切能量项，并包含折叠预防机制来惩罚负变形雅可比区域。

Result: 该方法减轻了非物理伪影如折叠，避免了过度平滑，提高了配准精度和解剖合理性。

Conclusion: DARE框架通过自适应正则化和折叠预防机制，在医学图像配准中实现了更好的稳定性和物理合理性平衡。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

Conclusion: AegisRF成功实现了在保护NeRF知识产权的同时维持渲染质量的目标

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多条件生成对抗网络框架，能够生成具有精确控制孔隙度参数的孔隙尺度图像，解决了地下表征中图像代表性和数据稀缺的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地下表征中获取真正代表整体地层性质的孔隙尺度图像存在根本性挑战，因为自然空间异质性导致提取的子图像与岩心测量值显著偏离，同时数据稀缺问题严重。

Method: 使用多条件生成对抗网络框架，在碳酸盐岩地层的薄片样本上训练，同时以孔隙度值和深度参数作为条件输入，捕获通用孔隙网络原理和深度特定的地质特征。

Result: 模型在所有地层中实现了出色的孔隙度控制（R^2=0.95），平均绝对误差为0.0099-0.0197，生成图像的二元约束误差为1.9-11.3%，远优于真实子图像的36.4-578%。

Conclusion: 该能力为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳储存、地热能源和地下水管理等需要了解代表性孔隙形态的应用领域。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成式AI的MRI加速新范式，从图像重建转向预测性成像，通过生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，显著提升高倍加速下的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI采集时间过长限制了临床吞吐量，传统图像重建方法在高度欠采样下效果有限，需要新的加速方法。

Method: 使用生成模型预测目标对比度图像作为数据驱动先验，然后基于该先验重建高度欠采样数据。模型可基于多种数据源进行条件预测，包括其他对比度图像、历史扫描图像、采集参数和患者信息。

Result: 在内部和多个公共数据集（总计14,921次扫描；1,051,904个切片）上评估，包括多通道k空间数据，在x4、x8和x12高加速因子下，该方法显著优于其他方法，包括使用替代或无先验信息的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了从图像重建到预测性成像的根本性转变，为MRI加速提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频方法仅处理单个序列，未能利用跨序列中普遍存在的结构规律性和重复运动模式，限制了3D姿态估计的性能提升。

Method: 提出模式重用图卷积网络(PRGCN)，包含图记忆库存储姿态原型，通过注意力机制动态检索，结合Mamba状态空间模型和自注意力的双流架构提取时空特征。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP基准测试中分别达到37.1mm和13.4mm的MPJPE，创下新SOTA，并展现出增强的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨序列模式重用机制对推动领域发展至关重要，将范式从单序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了卫星图像中系统性缺失像素（如云层遮挡）导致的表示偏差问题，特别是在甲烷羽流检测中，模型会将图像覆盖率与标签关联，导致在低覆盖率图像中检测性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像中系统性缺失像素（MNAR）会导致自动化特征提取模型出现表示偏差，特别是在甲烷羽流检测中，模型会错误地将图像覆盖率与标签关联，从而在低覆盖率图像中检测性能下降。

Method: 评估了多种插补方法以消除覆盖率与标签之间的依赖关系，并提出了一种加权重采样方案，通过在每个覆盖率区间强制类别平衡来去除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 结果显示重采样和插补都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不会损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。在操作场景中，去偏模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的概率更高。

Conclusion: 通过重采样和插补技术可以有效减少卫星图像甲烷羽流检测中的表示偏差，提高模型在低覆盖率图像中的检测性能，同时保持整体检测指标不受影响。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Result: 在SDGOD数据集上达到最先进性能，比现有域泛化方法提升15.9-31.4%，在复杂干扰环境中表现出显著鲁棒性优势

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效解决了单源域泛化目标检测中的伪相关性问题，显著提升了模型泛化能力和鲁棒性

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型通常以原生或高分辨率处理图像，导致97-99%的token都是视觉token，造成高计算成本和延迟，即使低分辨率图像就足够了。

Method: 使用紧凑型VLM（350M）提取特征并预测目标预训练VLM响应何时收敛到其正确回答能力的峰值，虽然作为离散分类器训练，但在推理时插值连续分辨率以实现细粒度控制。

Result: 在五个涵盖文档和自然图像的多模态基准测试中，以及不同的目标VLM上，CARES在保持任务性能的同时将计算量减少高达80%。

Conclusion: CARES通过智能选择最小足够分辨率，有效解决了VLM中视觉token过多导致的高计算成本问题，实现了计算效率的显著提升。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理小重叠或无重叠图像对时表现不佳，基于视频插值的中间帧生成方法存在模糊问题且选择策略效率低下。

Method: 提出混合视频生成(HVG)结合视频插值和姿态条件新视角合成模型生成清晰中间帧，使用基于特征匹配的选择器(FMS)选择适合姿态估计的帧。

Result: 在Cambridge Landmarks、ScanNet、DL3DV-10K和NAVI数据集上的实验表明，相比现有SOTA方法，PoseCrafter显著提升了姿态估计性能。

Conclusion: PoseCrafter通过改进的中间帧生成和选择策略，有效解决了小重叠或无重叠图像对的相机姿态估计挑战。

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉推理方面存在多个限制，特别是在识别关系、理解时间序列和计数对象方面表现不佳，需要深入分析失败原因并提出针对性改进方法。

Method: 研究了7个最先进视觉语言模型在计数任务中的推理能力，通过层间分析识别错误来源，并仅对输出层进行针对性微调训练。

Result: 实验表明视觉语言模型对物体特征高度敏感，错误主要源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射问题，仅微调输出层可使准确率提升高达21%。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的计数能力缺陷可以通过针对性训练输出层来有效改善，这一发现在真实世界数据集中得到了验证。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Motivation: 虽然T2I模型能生成无限合成数据，但提示词工程对数据质量、多样性和一致性的系统性影响尚未充分探索，需要研究提示复杂度如何影响合成数据的实用性。

Method: 通过合成实验验证泛化难度，并引入新的评估框架比较真实数据和合成数据的实用性，在CC12M、ImageNet-1k和DCI等数据集上分析不同T2I模型和推理时干预方法。

Result: 增加提示复杂度导致条件多样性和提示一致性降低，但减少合成-真实分布偏移。提示扩展方法通过预训练语言模型作为似然估计器，在图像多样性和美学上表现最佳，甚至超过真实数据。

Conclusion: 提示复杂度对合成数据质量有显著影响，当前推理时干预方法能在牺牲真实数据支持的情况下增强多样性，提示扩展是最有效的方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势（RGB提供高空间分辨率和纹理细节，事件相机提供高时间分辨率和HDR），但两者成像机制不同导致显著的时空不对称，阻碍了有效的多模态整合。

Method: HAD框架通过分层对齐策略明确建模和缓解时空不对称，在保持学生网络计算效率和参数紧凑性的同时最小化信息损失。

Result: 大量实验表明HAD持续优于最先进方法，全面的消融研究验证了每个设计组件的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: HAD成功解决了RGB和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，实现了有效的多模态知识蒸馏，在挑战性条件下显著提升了目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Motivation: 随着物体检测模型在自动驾驶汽车等网络物理系统中的部署增加，确保其对抗威胁的安全性至关重要。现有研究主要关注图像域的攻击，而视频域的攻击，特别是在无盒设置下的攻击，尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 利用RGBA视频的alpha通道将恶意目标视频与良性视频融合，设计融合算法确保视觉隐蔽性和兼容性，无需访问模型架构、参数或输出。

Result: 在五个最先进的物体检测器、一个视觉语言模型和一个多模态大语言模型上评估，攻击成功率在所有场景下达到100%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频感知系统中一个先前未被探索的漏洞，强调了在对抗环境中考虑alpha通道的防御措施的紧迫性。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种设置下客观指标和主观质量均显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: VGD验证了可扩展性和高保真环视重建能力。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

*Su Ho Han,Jeongseok Hyun,Pilhyeon Lee,Minho Shim,Dongyoon Wee,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DecAF方法，通过分解注意力融合机制将MLLM的注意力图直接转换为分割掩码，无需训练即可实现视频推理分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面表现强大，但其原始注意力图存在噪声且与物体区域对齐不佳，需要一种无需训练的方法来精炼这些注意力图以实现定位。

Method: 提出分解注意力融合(DecAF)，包含对比性物体-背景融合和互补视频-帧融合两种机制，结合注意力引导的SAM2提示来获取细粒度掩码。

Result: DecAF在无需训练的方法中表现优异，在引用和推理视频对象分割基准测试中达到与基于训练方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将MLLM的注意力图转化为分割掩码，提供了一种无需训练的视频推理分割解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CBDiff模型，通过生成多个多样化的伪造定位图来增强图像伪造定位的可信度，采用伯努利噪声和时间步交叉注意力机制，在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法通常生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏高精度和可靠性，无法满足法医分析和安全监控等高风险应用的需求。

Method: 提出条件伯努利扩散模型(CBDiff)，生成多个多样化的伪造定位图；引入伯努利噪声以更好反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性；设计时间步交叉注意力(TSCAttention)机制利用语义特征和时间步指导改进检测。

Result: 在8个公开基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多个定位图有效处理伪造区域的不确定性和变异性，展现了在现实世界部署的强大潜力。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个系统性基准来评估胸部X光片中视觉语言模型的跨模态可解释性，发现当前模型在临床可靠的定位能力方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中表现出色，但其定位能力（文本概念与视觉证据的对齐程度）尚未充分探索。在医学领域，可靠的定位对于可解释性和临床采用至关重要。

Method: 使用七种CLIP风格的视觉语言模型变体，通过交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图生成视觉解释，并定量评估其与放射科医生标注区域在多病理情况下的对齐程度。

Result: 研究发现：(1)所有模型变体对大型明确病理的定位合理，但对小型或弥散病变性能显著下降；(2)在胸部X光特定数据集上预训练的模型比通用领域训练的模型对齐效果更好；(3)模型整体识别能力与定位能力强相关。

Conclusion: 尽管当前视觉语言模型具有较强的识别能力，但在临床可靠的定位方面仍有不足，凸显了在医学实践中部署前需要进行有针对性的可解释性基准测试的必要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于散射系数的去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来抑制高斯噪声，在卡通图像去噪中达到了极小极大渐近界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的稀疏估计器在框架中无法充分适应复杂信号规律性，特别是对于边缘为分段C^α曲线的卡通图像，当Lipschitz指数α≤2且为未知参数时，小波、曲波等框架是次优的。

Method: 引入散射系数作为简化的卷积神经网络模型，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来构建去噪估计器。

Result: 数值实验表明该去噪估计器对于所有Lipschitz指数α≤2的卡通图像都能达到极小极大渐近界，并证明了这些ℓ¹范数捕捉了不同类型的几何图像规律性。

Conclusion: 该方法为抑制信号噪声和指定函数几何规律性提供了不同的调和分析方法，并在调和分析与深度卷积网络去噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

Conclusion: GenComm通过生成通信机制有效解决了异构多智能体协作中的领域差距问题，实现了高效可扩展的感知协作。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

TL;DR: AMR是一个零外部依赖的增强时刻检索框架，通过两阶段训练解决现有方法的数据稀缺、边界模糊和语义区分不足问题，在多个基准测试中优于现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有时刻检索方法的三个关键瓶颈：数据稀缺导致模型陷入浅层关键词特征关联、相邻事件间边界模糊、以及细粒度语义区分不足（如区分"踢球"与"扔球"）。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义感知；蒸馏阶段引入双查询集（原始查询保持DETR定位，主动查询动态适应真实数据分布），通过跨阶段蒸馏损失确保知识一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AMR实现了比先前最先进方法更好的性能。

Conclusion: AMR框架能够在不依赖额外数据的情况下解决边界模糊和语义混淆问题，同时保持边界和语义区分能力，显著提升了时刻检索的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Method: 构建CT-RATE-VQA数据集(84K QA对)，提出MedReason-R1模型，嵌入放大病灶区域，引入GRPO强化学习框架

Result: 在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能，同时保持泛化能力

Conclusion: MedReason-R1通过显式推理过程和强化学习，有效提升了医学影像诊断的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

TL;DR: ReAct-GS通过重要性感知的致密化准则和重新激活机制，解决了3D高斯溅射中的过重建伪影问题，在复杂场景中实现了更好的视图合成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在复杂场景中会出现过重建伪影，表现为局部模糊和针状扭曲。现有方法归因于大规模高斯分布分割不足，但本文识别出两个根本限制：致密化过程中的梯度幅度稀释和原始冻结现象。

Method: 提出ReAct-GS方法，包括：(1) 重要性感知致密化准则，结合多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域中停滞的原始增长；(2) 重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的原始分布。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重建伪影，在标准新视图合成指标上达到最先进性能，同时保留了精细的几何细节。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS通过重新激活机制成功解决了3D高斯溅射中的过重建问题，该机制在与其他3D-GS变体（如Pixel-GS）集成时也能带来一致的改进，展示了其广泛的适用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有无配对图像翻译方法在医学影像中会扭曲细长曲线结构（如微血管），影响诊断可靠性和定量分析，这在眼科和血管成像中尤为重要。

Method: CST框架通过添加曲线结构提取模块提供拓扑监督，可集成到CycleGAN和UNSB等现有方法中，在训练中保持结构一致性。

Result: 在光学相干断层扫描血管成像、彩色眼底和X射线冠状动脉造影三种成像模态上的综合评估表明，CST提高了翻译保真度并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CST通过加强学习映射中的几何完整性，为医学影像中曲线结构感知的跨域翻译建立了原则性路径。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

Motivation: 现有深度学习活体检测系统多为黑盒模型，决策过程不透明，需要解释性技术来理解模型行为

Method: 提出Ensemble-CAM技术，为深度学习人脸活体检测系统提供视觉解释，识别关键区域

Result: 该方法能够可视化显示生物特征图像被判定为真实或伪造的关键区域

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM提高了深度学习人脸活体检测系统的透明度和可信度

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，通过时空注意力机制和稳定性约束从高维视频中提取可解释的动态系统变量，抑制视觉干扰因素，实现鲁棒的潜在表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从高维视频中提取真实动态变量面临背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等视觉干扰因素的挑战，需要开发能够抑制这些干扰的鲁棒表示学习方法。

Method: 第一阶段使用时序变换器自编码器，通过全局注意力聚焦动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关性分析选择物理意义维度，并用Lyapunov稳定性正则化器精炼转移动态。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动态系统上的实验显示，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动保持不变性，在CNN和纯变换器基线中实现最低的分析均方误差。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力与稳定性约束可以产生既准确又物理可解释的预测模型，为动态系统分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法面临激活值分布高度不均匀和权重量化码本静态不匹配两大挑战

Method: 自适应权重量化方案：分位数初始化码本、EMA在线码本适配、敏感度指导的混合精度分配；激活值采用硬件友好的非均匀到均匀映射

Result: ImageNet上ResNet-18平均2.81比特达到71.512% Top-1准确率，优于同类方法；CIFAR-10消融实验验证各组件有效性

Conclusion: ADQ框架有效解决了量化中的分布不均和码本不匹配问题，在低比特量化下实现优异性能

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在多模态运动生成任务中的局限性，缺乏统一框架来处理多样化输入和输出场景，以及生成内容的一致性和真实性问题。

Method: 提出使用参考运动作为条件信号，采用渐进式弱到强混合条件训练策略处理多模态冲突，构建最大统一多模态数据集OmniMoCap-X，并使用GPT-4o自动生成结构化标注。

Result: 实验证明OmniMotion-X在多个多模态任务上显著超越现有方法，实现最先进性能，能够生成真实、连贯且可控的长时运动。

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态人体运动生成提供了统一的解决方案，通过创新的条件信号和训练策略实现了高质量、一致性的运动生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练和部署分布不一致时性能下降，现有测试时适应方法忽视了长尾分布中的原型退化和语义相似类别的混淆问题。

Method: 使用类别感知原型缓存模块动态调整每类容量，结合负对比学习机制识别和约束困难负样本，采用非对称优化仅更新文本原型。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CPL-NC在ResNet-50和ViT-B/16骨干网络上均优于现有测试时适应方法。

Conclusion: CPL-NC是一个轻量级测试时适应框架，能有效提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型的文本引导图像编辑能力虽有显著进展，但研究社区缺乏基于真实图像的大规模、高质量、开放可用的数据集，限制了进一步的发展。

Method: 利用Nano-Banana从OpenImages的真实照片生成多样化的编辑对，采用细粒度图像编辑分类法确保编辑类型全面覆盖，通过MLLM质量评分和精心筛选保证内容保持和指令忠实度。

Result: 构建了包含40万张图像的Pico-Banana-400K数据集，包含三个专门子集：7.2万例多轮编辑集、5.6万例偏好子集，以及长短指令配对集，支持复杂编辑场景研究。

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为训练和评估下一代文本引导图像编辑模型提供了大规模、高质量、任务丰富的数据基础，推动了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

Motivation: 单目深度估计研究进展迅速，但如何评估仍是一个开放性问题，现有文献缺乏标准化，且众多评估指标的权衡和行为未被充分理解。

Method: 对现有指标进行定量分析，考察它们对地面真实值各种扰动的敏感性，特别是与人类判断进行比较；提出基于相对表面法线的新指标、新的深度可视化工具和创建复合指标的合理方法。

Result: 分析显示现有指标对曲率扰动（如使平坦表面波浪化）严重不敏感；提出的新指标和复合指标方法能更好地与人类判断保持一致。

Conclusion: 需要改进单目深度估计的评估指标，特别是对曲率扰动的敏感性，提出的新指标和工具为此提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and

videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in

Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一框架来分析验证式测试时扩展中的生成器覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和采样算法次优性之间的几何交互关系，发现了次优性-覆盖率曲线的三个区域，并分析了顺序和批量采样算法的计算复杂度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然带验证的测试时扩展在提升大语言模型性能方面显示出潜力，但验证器的作用及其不完善性仍未得到充分探索。现有研究只捕捉了这些因素的部分子集，缺乏一个量化它们交互几何的统一框架。

Method: 将可验证的测试时扩展构建为一个传输问题，通过这个框架来表征覆盖率、验证器收敛区域和次优性之间的交互关系，并提出并分析了顺序和批量两类采样算法。

Result: 发现了次优性-覆盖率曲线存在三个区域：传输区域（次优性随覆盖率增加而增加）、策略改进区域（次优性可能随覆盖率增加而减少，取决于验证器的收敛区域）和饱和区域（次优性趋于平稳，不受覆盖率影响）。在Qwen、Llama和Gemma模型上的实证结果验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 该研究为理解验证式测试时扩展中的关键因素交互提供了统一的理论框架，揭示了不同采样算法在计算复杂度和性能权衡方面的特性，有助于指导实际应用中的算法选择。

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习诊断方法依赖静态数据集，无法模拟临床医生在实践中的顺序性、资源感知推理过程，特别是在高压或资源有限环境中需要更有效的诊断支持。

Method: 整合贝叶斯实验设计与大型语言模型，LLMs作为灵活模拟器生成患者状态分布并支持信念更新，无需特定任务的训练数据。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上评估显示，ACTMED能够优化测试选择，提高诊断准确性、可解释性和资源利用效率。

Conclusion: 该框架朝着透明、自适应且与临床医生对齐的诊断系统迈进一步，能够在减少对领域特定数据依赖的情况下跨环境泛化。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to support clinical
diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于人类偏好的奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击和泛化能力差的问题，模型会利用训练数据中的虚假特征（如回答冗长、讨好语气等）来获取高分，而非真正反映人类意图。

Method: 受核视角不变性理论启发，提出PRISM方法，通过闭式学习目标学习具有特征映射的组不变核函数，来缓解偏好奖励学习中的捷径行为。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法一致提高了奖励模型在多样化分布外任务上的准确性，并减少了下游策略模型对捷径的依赖。

Conclusion: PRISM为基于偏好的对齐建立了一个鲁棒框架，有效缓解了奖励模型中的捷径行为问题。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning from human feedback, preference-based reward models
play a central role in aligning large language models to human-aligned
behavior. However, recent studies show that these models are prone to reward
hacking and often fail to generalize well due to over-optimization. They
achieve high reward scores by exploiting shortcuts, that is, exploiting
spurious features (e.g., response verbosity, agreeable tone, or sycophancy)
that correlate with human preference labels in the training data rather than
genuinely reflecting the intended objectives. In this paper, instead of probing
these issues one at a time, we take a broader view of the reward hacking
problem as shortcut behaviors and introduce a principled yet flexible approach
to mitigate shortcut behaviors in preference-based reward learning. Inspired by
the invariant theory in the kernel perspective, we propose Preference-based
Reward Invariance for Shortcut Mitigation (PRISM), which learns group-invariant
kernels with feature maps in a closed-form learning objective. Experimental
results in several benchmarks show that our method consistently improves the
accuracy of the reward model on diverse out-of-distribution tasks and reduces
the dependency on shortcuts in downstream policy models, establishing a robust
framework for preference-based alignment.

Conclusion: MUSE基准为评估不变音乐表征和开发更鲁棒的AI系统提供了关键工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural

probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在医疗领域快速扩展，但其按照CONSORT标准评估临床试验报告的能力尚不清楚，特别是在认知和推理策略方面。

Method: 采用行为和元认知分析方法，使用专家验证的数据，在三种提示条件下系统比较了两个代表性大型语言模型。

Result: 模型在处理不同CONSORT项目和提示类型时表现出明显差异，包括推理风格转变、明确的不确定性表达和替代解释方式。

Conclusion: 结果凸显了这些系统在临床合规自动化方面的当前局限性，并强调了理解其认知适应和策略行为对于开发更可解释和可靠的医疗AI的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

*Yuqiao Tan,Shizhu He,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了推理模型中的模式选择问题，将其视为早期退出问题的更具挑战性变体，旨在通过零步思维决策来减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但由于逐步思考过程容易导致过度思考，产生不必要的计算开销。模式选择和早期退出方法都旨在减轻这种计算负担。

Method: 将模式选择识别为早期退出问题的变体，比较了9种基线方法，包括基于提示的方法和利用模型内部信息的方法，重点关注零步思维决策。

Result: 基于提示的方法由于分类能力有限而经常失败，而利用内部信息的方法在大多数场景中表现更好但稳定性存在问题。现有方法在信息有限的情况下不足以有效解决模式选择问题。

Conclusion: 仅依赖模型提供信息的方法在信息有限的情况下无法有效解决模式选择问题，突显了该任务的持续挑战性。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code

TL;DR: WebGraphEval是一个评估网页代理的框架，将多个代理的轨迹抽象为统一的加权动作图，支持多路径、跨代理和效率感知的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网页代理评估主要依赖二元成功指标或单一参考轨迹，忽略了基准数据集中的结构多样性。

Method: 将多个代理的轨迹抽象为统一的加权动作图，进行规范编码、合并重复行为，并应用结构分析包括奖励传播和成功加权边统计。

Result: 在六个网页代理的数千条轨迹评估中，图抽象捕捉了跨模型规律性，突出了冗余和低效，识别了基于结果指标忽略的关键决策点。

Conclusion: 通过将网页交互构建为图结构数据，WebGraphEval为网页代理建立了多路径、跨代理和效率感知评估的通用方法。

Abstract: Current evaluation of web agents largely reduces to binary success metrics or
conformity to a single reference trajectory, ignoring the structural diversity
present in benchmark datasets. We present WebGraphEval, a framework that
abstracts trajectories from multiple agents into a unified, weighted action
graph. This representation is directly compatible with benchmarks such as
WebArena, leveraging leaderboard runs and newly collected trajectories without
modifying environments. The framework canonically encodes actions, merges
recurring behaviors, and applies structural analyses including reward
propagation and success-weighted edge statistics. Evaluations across thousands
of trajectories from six web agents show that the graph abstraction captures
cross-model regularities, highlights redundancy and inefficiency, and
identifies critical decision points overlooked by outcome-based metrics. By
framing web interaction as graph-structured data, WebGraphEval establishes a
general methodology for multi-path, cross-agent, and efficiency-aware
evaluation of web agents.

TL;DR: 本研究通过实验评估ChatGPT在法律领域的表现，与基于正则表达式的基线方法进行比较，发现ChatGPT即使具备必要知识和能力，也无法整合这些能力进行推理以得出全面结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示ChatGPT在法律领域的局限性，特别是在处理复杂法律问题时整合多种能力进行推理的能力。

Method: 采用实验方法，将ChatGPT的表现与基于正则表达式的基线方法进行对比分析。

Result: ChatGPT无法有效分解复杂法律问题并整合多种能力提供统一全面的解决方案，显示出在推理能力方面的重大局限。

Conclusion: 真正的智能仍然是人类独有的特质，至少在法律领域，人工智能缺乏全面理解和推理能力。

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

Motivation: 传统基于一致先例的理由模型存在局限性，而广义理由模型虽然能处理不一致先例，但缺乏相应的论证性解释方法。

Method: 扩展推导状态论证框架(DSA-framework)，使其能够解释基于广义理由模型的推理过程。

Result: 开发了一个能够为广义理由模型提供论证性解释的扩展框架。

Conclusion: 成功填补了广义理由模型在论证性解释方面的空白，为处理不一致先例的推理提供了有效的解释机制。

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型智能体是否能重现人类在线行为的复杂社交动态，以及哪些记忆和学习机制能够促使这种动态出现。

Method: 开发多智能体LLM模拟框架，智能体通过重复互动、相互评估和上下文学习来适应行为，使用捕捉在线参与核心驱动因素的行为奖励函数，包括社交互动、信息寻求、自我呈现、协调和情感支持。

Result: 实验表明，经过指导的LLM智能体能够发展出稳定的互动模式并形成涌现的社交联系，产生的网络结构反映了真实在线社区的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LLM群体中的集体动态建立了原则性测试平台，揭示了人工智能体如何近似或偏离人类社交行为。

Abstract: Can large language model (LLM) agents reproduce the complex social dynamics
that characterize human online behavior -- shaped by homophily, reciprocity,
and social validation -- and what memory and learning mechanisms enable such
dynamics to emerge? We present a multi-agent LLM simulation framework in which
agents repeatedly interact, evaluate one another, and adapt their behavior
through in-context learning accelerated by a coaching signal. To model human
social behavior, we design behavioral reward functions that capture core
drivers of online engagement, including social interaction, information
seeking, self-presentation, coordination, and emotional support. These rewards
align agent objectives with empirically observed user motivations, enabling the
study of how network structures and group formations emerge from individual
decision-making. Our experiments show that coached LLM agents develop stable
interaction patterns and form emergent social ties, yielding network structures
that mirror properties of real online communities. By combining behavioral
rewards with in-context adaptation, our framework establishes a principled
testbed for investigating collective dynamics in LLM populations and reveals
how artificial agents may approximate or diverge from human-like social
behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界环境通常是非平稳的，需要智能体持续适应新任务和变化条件。现有持续强化学习方法存在灾难性遗忘和知识利用效率低的问题。

Method: 提出持续知识适应策略，维护任务特定知识向量池并动态使用历史知识适应新任务；引入自适应知识合并机制，合并相似知识向量以减少内存需求。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，CKA-RL优于现有最优方法，整体性能提升4.20%，前向迁移提升8.02%。

Conclusion: CKA-RL有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，实现了跨任务的高效知识迁移，在持续强化学习任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

TL;DR: MSC-Bench是一个大规模基准测试，用于评估LLM代理在分层MCP生态系统中的多跳端到端工具编排能力，通过五级课程系统测试代理从单工具编排到复杂跨服务器规划的全面能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试往往孤立评估工具，忽略了功能重叠和跨服务器编排等挑战，导致评估过于乐观。MSC-Bench旨在填补这些空白，构建更客观的评估框架。

Method: 通过'等效功能集'构建真实基准，采用五级课程结构系统测试代理能力，从单工具编排到复杂跨服务器规划，并测试对超出范围请求的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示刚性层次结构会阻碍性能，即使最先进的代理在鲁棒性方面也存在系统性弱点，基准能够有效暴露这些局限性。

Conclusion: MSC-Bench提供了一个诊断框架，揭示了当前工具使用代理的局限性，并为开发更强大高效的工具使用代理提供了指导。

Abstract: We introduce MSC-Bench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-hop,
end-to-end tool orchestration by LLM agents in a hierarchical Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. Existing benchmarks often evaluate tools in
isolation, ignoring challenges such as functional overlap and cross-server
orchestration, leading to overly optimistic assessments. MSC-Bench addresses
these gaps by constructing ground truth through 'equal function sets', allowing
objective metrics such as F1 score and reducing the dependency on
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation. Organized as a five-level curriculum, it
systematically tests agent capabilities from single-tool orchestration to
complex cross-server planning, and robustness to out-of-scope requests.
Experiments reveal that rigid hierarchies can hinder performance without
co-designed strategies, and even state-of-the-art agents exhibit systemic
weaknesses in robustness. MSC-Bench provides a diagnostic framework to expose
these limitations and guide the development of more capable and efficient
tool-using agents. The benchmark and resources are publicly available at

TL;DR: NeSyPr是一个新颖的具身推理框架，通过神经符号程序化将符号知识编译为可组合的过程表示，使语言模型能够在资源受限的动态环境中进行高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在动态环境中采用语言模型进行具身任务时面临的延迟、连接性和资源限制问题，避免对大规模推理引擎或符号规划器的在线依赖。

Method: 首先使用符号工具生成任务特定计划，然后将这些计划转化为编码隐式产生规则的可组合过程表示，最终将这些过程无缝集成到语言模型的推理过程中。

Result: 在PDDLGym、VirtualHome和ALFWorld等具身基准测试中，NeSyPr展示了比大规模推理模型和符号规划器更高效的推理能力，同时使用更紧凑的语言模型。

Conclusion: 神经符号程序化能够将多步符号结构化路径查找和推理抽象为单步语言模型推理，适用于延迟敏感和资源受限的物理系统部署。

Abstract: We address the challenge of adopting language models (LMs) for embodied tasks
in dynamic environments, where online access to large-scale inference engines
or symbolic planners is constrained due to latency, connectivity, and resource
limitations. To this end, we present NeSyPr, a novel embodied reasoning
framework that compiles knowledge via neurosymbolic proceduralization, thereby
equipping LM-based agents with structured, adaptive, and timely reasoning
capabilities. In NeSyPr, task-specific plans are first explicitly generated by
a symbolic tool leveraging its declarative knowledge. These plans are then
transformed into composable procedural representations that encode the plans'
implicit production rules, enabling the resulting composed procedures to be
seamlessly integrated into the LM's inference process. This neurosymbolic
proceduralization abstracts and generalizes multi-step symbolic structured
path-finding and reasoning into single-step LM inference, akin to human
knowledge compilation. It supports efficient test-time inference without
relying on external symbolic guidance, making it well suited for deployment in
latency-sensitive and resource-constrained physical systems. We evaluate NeSyPr
on the embodied benchmarks PDDLGym, VirtualHome, and ALFWorld, demonstrating
its efficient reasoning capabilities over large-scale reasoning models and a
symbolic planner, while using more compact LMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言指令的灵活性导致了语言条件任务中的显著模糊性，严重降低了算法性能，需要解决这一限制。

Method: DAIL包含两个关键组件：分布策略和语义对齐模块。分布策略通过价值分布估计机制增强任务可区分性，语义对齐模块捕捉轨迹与语言指令之间的对应关系。

Result: 在结构化和视觉观察基准测试上的广泛实验结果表明，DAIL能有效解决指令模糊性问题，性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DAIL通过分布对齐学习方法成功解决了语言指令的模糊性问题，在多个基准测试中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is

TL;DR: HSCodeComp是首个评估深度搜索代理在分层规则应用能力的电商基准测试，要求代理根据产品描述预测10位HS编码，结果显示最佳代理准确率仅46.8%，远低于人类专家的95.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试忽视了代理应用复杂规则（如法律条款、医疗手册和关税规则）的关键能力，这些规则具有模糊边界和隐含逻辑关系，对代理构成挑战。

Method: 从大型电商平台收集真实数据构建HSCodeComp基准，包含632个产品条目，涵盖多样化产品类别，HS编码由多位人类专家标注。

Result: 在多个最先进的LLM、开源和闭源代理上的实验结果显示巨大性能差距：最佳代理仅达到46.8%的10位准确率，远低于人类专家的95.0%。测试时扩展也无法进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 分层规则应用对当前代理构成重大挑战，需要开发更强大的代理来处理具有模糊边界和隐含逻辑关系的复杂规则。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Method: 结合大语言模型的多智能体进化系统，首先使用经典规划器生成基线解决方案，然后迭代优化以适应动态城市条件和异构工作者偏好，同时产生自然语言解释。

Result: 在两个大规模移动数据集和七种动态干扰上的实验表明，AgentSense在适应性和可解释性方面优于传统方法，相比单智能体LLM基线在性能和鲁棒性上表现更好，提供更合理透明的解释。

Conclusion: AgentSense代表了向部署适应性和可解释性城市感知系统的重要进展，为基于web的城市管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

Method: 首先生成和弦音琶音，构建加权图（节点代表和弦琶音，边权重基于最优过渡音计算），然后寻找最短路径并重构和弦音独奏线条。

Result: 开发了一个用户友好的系统，能够处理输入输出，帮助吉他学生练习和弦音独奏。

Conclusion: 该基于图论的引擎为吉他学生提供了一种有效的和弦音独奏练习方法，有助于掌握这一重要的爵士吉他技巧。

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

Result: 实验结果显示准确率超过90%，超越了文献中的竞争解决方案。

Conclusion: 该系统可被排名和推荐系统利用进行知情决策，得益于可解释性模块，这增强了对结果预测的信任。

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLIE是一个将大语言模型与概率建模相结合的统一框架，用于学习加权规则集。该框架通过规则生成、逻辑回归、迭代优化和评估四个阶段，实现了比直接将规则注入LLM更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的规则学习方法忽视了规则间的相互作用，且未能充分利用LLM与概率规则学习的结合潜力，限制了推理的鲁棒性。

Method: RLIE包含四个阶段：(1) LLM生成和筛选候选规则；(2) 逻辑回归学习概率权重进行全局选择和校准；(3) 基于预测误差迭代优化规则集；(4) 评估加权规则集作为直接分类器的性能。

Result: 在真实数据集上的评估显示，直接使用学习到的权重应用规则可获得更优性能，而将规则、权重和逻辑模型输出提示给LLM反而会降低准确性。

Conclusion: LLM擅长语义生成和解释，但在精确概率集成方面可靠性较低。RLIE阐明了LLM在归纳推理中的潜力和局限性，并将其与经典概率规则组合方法结合，实现更可靠的神经符号推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

*Gunshi Gupta,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira,Yarin Gal,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo是一个基于transformer的架构和训练方法，用于解决强化学习中记忆密集型、长视野任务的挑战，通过引入记忆创建和检索机制来提高模型效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有transformer策略在具身决策任务中受限于上下文长度，而人类能够利用压缩记忆来维持长期经验。需要开发能够有效压缩和利用记忆的模型。

Method: 提出Memo架构，在训练过程中通过插入周期性总结标记来创建和检索记忆，实现输入的有效压缩。

Result: 在网格世界元RL基准和真实室内多目标导航任务中，Memo优于朴素长上下文transformer基线，同时计算和存储效率更高，在推理时对更长上下文具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Memo通过记忆机制有效解决了transformer在长视野任务中的上下文限制问题，为具身智能体的长期操作提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PROBE基准来评估LLM智能体的主动性能力，将主动性分解为三个核心能力：搜索未指定问题、识别具体瓶颈和执行适当解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估主动性的基准受限于局部上下文，无法测试跨来源和长时间跨度的推理能力，需要新的评估框架。

Method: 开发PROBE基准，将主动性分解为三个能力管道，并应用于评估领先的LLM和流行智能体框架。

Result: 即使是先进模型也难以解决该基准，GPT-5和Claude Opus-4.1的最佳端到端性能仅为40%，揭示了自主行动系统的当前局限性。

Conclusion: 结果突显了智能体系统中自主行动的当前限制，并揭示了有前景的未来研究方向。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly moving towards proactivity: rather than
awaiting instruction, they exercise agency to anticipate user needs and solve
them autonomously. However, evaluating proactivity is challenging; current
benchmarks are constrained to localized context, limiting their ability to test
reasoning across sources and longer time horizons. To address this gap, we
present PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks). PROBE decomposes
proactivity as a pipeline of three core capabilities: (1) searching for
unspecified issues, (2) identifying specific bottlenecks, and (3) executing
appropriate resolutions. We apply PROBE to evaluate leading LLMs and popular
agentic frameworks, showing that even state-of-the-art models struggle to solve
this benchmark. Computing our consistent measurements across frontier LLMs and
agents, we find that the best end-to-end performance of 40% is achieved by both
GPT-5 and Claude Opus-4.1. Additionally, we demonstrate the relative
capabilities of each model and analyze mutual failure modes. Our results
highlight the current limitations of autonomous action in agentic systems, and
expose promising future research directions.

TL;DR: WorldTest是一个评估模型学习智能体的协议，将无奖励交互与在不同但相关环境中的评分测试阶段分开。通过AutumnBench套件（43个交互式网格世界环境和129个任务）比较了人类和前沿模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前世界模型学习和评估方法偏离了目标：训练和评估都锚定在下一帧预测上，成功通过相同环境中的奖励最大化来评分。需要一种能够评估智能体学习环境动态能力的协议。

Method: 提出WorldTest协议，包含无奖励探索、衍生测试和行为评分三个模板。使用AutumnBench套件，包含43个网格世界环境和129个任务，涵盖掩码帧预测、规划和因果动态变化预测三个任务家族。

Result: 人类表现优于模型，计算规模扩展只在某些环境中提高性能而非所有环境。AutumnBench揭示了世界模型学习中的显著改进空间。

Conclusion: WorldTest提供了一个新颖的模板来评估智能体对环境动态的学习情况，AutumnBench暴露了世界模型学习中的重大改进机会。

Abstract: Model-learning agents should gather information to learn world models that
support many downstream tasks and inferences, such as predicting unobserved
states, estimating near- and far-term consequences of actions, planning action
sequences, and detecting changes in dynamics. Current methods for learning and
evaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are
anchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization
in the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate
model-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test
phase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is
open-ended$\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown
ahead of time$\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing
comparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a
suite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three
families: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the
causal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models
on AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute
improves performance only in some environments but not others. WorldTest
provides a novel template$\unicode{x2014}$reward-free exploration, derived
tests, and behavior-based scoring$\unicode{x2014}$to evaluate what agents learn
about environment dynamics, and AutumnBench exposes significant headroom in
world-model learning.

*Minseok Jung,Abhas Ricky,Muhammad Rameez Chatni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个3D优化框架，联合优化AI推理的准确性、成本和延迟，通过多目标优化方法实现约束感知的推理扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的1D启发式和2D权衡方法无法同时考虑成本、延迟和准确性约束，需要更全面的优化框架。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛模拟在三个代表性场景和九个模拟大语言模型上评估四种优化方法，解决3D多目标优化问题。

Result: 膝点优化方法实现了最佳平衡，当精度优先时准确性最大化方法仍然有利。该框架为不同操作环境下的部署感知推理扩展奠定了理论基础。

Conclusion: 3D多目标优化框架能够捕捉1D和2D优化无法覆盖的可行空间，实现环境自适应的推理扩展参数选择。

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在临床应用中受限于样本量不足，现有的基础模型由于自监督学习与脑-结果关系不一致而表现欠佳。

Method: 利用丰富的环境变量和人口统计数据，将脑建模构建为多任务学习，包括：(i)通过标记脑-环境交互进行多任务预训练；(ii)使用预训练BEI的伪标签进行半监督微调。

Result: 在性别预测、人类行为识别以及自闭症、帕金森病、阿尔茨海默病和精神分裂症的早期诊断等应用中取得了有前景的结果。

Conclusion: 该基础模型具有促进当前神经影像在临床常规应用中应用的巨大潜力。

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

TL;DR: ADPO是一个统一框架，扩展了DPO，引入软偏好概率、任意参考策略锚定和列表偏好建模，在噪声环境中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DPO假设硬二元标签和成对比较，无法处理偏好不确定性、训练不稳定性和列表偏好场景。ADPO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入软偏好概率编码不确定性；任意参考策略锚定通过群组平移不变性和隐式KL正则化稳定训练；使用Plackett-Luce分布进行列表偏好建模。

Result: 在上下文老虎机中，锚定使WinMass比标准DPO提升38-63%；KDE平滑在重尾噪声下达到0.68 vs 0.32（112%相对增益）；在顺序强化学习中，锚定在噪声偏好下性能提升15-29%。

Conclusion: ADPO将DPO、Bradley-Terry目标和Top-1-vs-Rest公式统一为特例。推荐在干净或中等噪声下使用成对锚定Soft-DPO，在极端污染下使用基于KDE的列表ADPO。

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型和机器学习的广泛应用，需要能够在笔记本电脑和移动电话等小型设备上部署这些模型的框架。MLX框架专为苹果硅设备的机器学习计算优化而创建。

Method: 创建了MLX-transformers框架，包含不同的transformer实现，并将PyTorch模型检查点转换为MLX格式。在两种苹果硅MacBook设备上对BERT、RoBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa模型进行基准测试，并与NVIDIA CUDA GPU进行比较。

Result: 研究结果突显了MLX在苹果生态系统内实现高效且更易访问的设备上机器学习应用的潜力。

Conclusion: MLX框架在苹果硅设备上表现出良好的性能，能够有效支持设备上的机器学习应用部署。

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

Motivation: RLHF/RLVR对不一致或错误奖励的噪声高度敏感，但噪声与基于群体的策略优化方法之间的相互作用研究不足。

Method: 引入GRPO和Dr.GRPO框架，将奖励噪声建模为伯努利噪声，通过估计奖励翻转概率进行噪声校正，获得可证明无偏的梯度估计。

Result: 在数学任务上准确率提升高达6.7个百分点，代码任务上提升1.5个百分点，在真实奖励模型条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: 将监督学习中的标签噪声校正与现代RLHF相结合，为噪声现实部署提供了理论洞见和实用算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 提出的多尺度学习方法有效解决了复杂系统建模的挑战，提供了在所有时间尺度上的近似和解释，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modeling and predicting the dynamics of complex multiscale systems remains a
significant challenge due to their inherent nonlinearities and sensitivity to
initial conditions, as well as limitations of traditional machine learning
methods that fail to capture high frequency behaviours. To overcome these
difficulties, we propose three approaches for multiscale learning. The first
leverages the Partition of Unity (PU) method, integrated with neural networks,
to decompose the dynamics into local components and directly predict both
macro- and micro-scale behaviors. The second applies the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to extract dominant modes that explicitly separate macro-
and micro-scale dynamics. Since full access to the data matrix is rarely
available in practice, we further employ a Sparse High-Order SVD to reconstruct
multiscale dynamics from limited measurements. Together, these approaches
ensure that both coarse and fine dynamics are accurately captured, making the
framework effective for real-world applications involving complex, multi-scale
phenomena and adaptable to higher-dimensional systems with incomplete
observations, by providing an approximation and interpretation in all time
scales present in the phenomena under study.

Motivation: 离线强化学习在LLM对齐中面临策略熵急剧下降、优化不稳定甚至崩溃的挑战，需要解决负优势样本主导梯度的问题

Method: 提出BAPO方法，基于熵裁剪规则动态调整裁剪边界，自适应平衡正负梯度贡献，保持策略熵并稳定优化

Result: 在AIME 2024/2025基准测试中，7B BAPO模型超越开源模型，32B BAPO模型在同规模模型中达到SOTA，甚至超越o3-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking等专有系统

Conclusion: BAPO通过动态裁剪机制有效解决了离线RL的优化不平衡问题，实现了快速、稳定且数据高效的训练

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

*Shuofeng Zhang,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 许多深度神经网络泛化度量存在脆弱性问题，即使微小的训练改动也会显著改变度量值、趋势或缩放行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度神经网络的泛化度量难以获得紧致边界，但通常被认为能反映定性泛化趋势。本文旨在揭示这些后验泛化度量的脆弱性。

Method: 通过实验分析不同训练修改（如超参数调整、优化器变化）对各种泛化度量的影响，包括路径范数、谱范数、Frobenius范数、平坦度代理和确定性PAC-Bayes代理等。

Result: 发现许多泛化度量对训练修改高度敏感，例如学习率调整可以反转路径范数的学习曲线斜率。PAC-Bayes原点度量虽然对超参数变化不敏感，但无法捕捉数据复杂度的差异。

Conclusion: 泛化度量开发者应明确审计其度量的脆弱性，函数基边际似然PAC-Bayes边界能更好地捕捉数据复杂度的缩放行为，但不是后验度量。

Abstract: A wide variety of generalization measures have been applied to deep neural
networks (DNNs). Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such
measures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In
this position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --
those computed on trained networks -- are \textbf{fragile}: small training
modifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a
measure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter
changes, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants
can reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization
measures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For
instance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,
and is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.
However, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across
learning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based
marginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in
data-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is
not a post-mortem measure. Beyond demonstrating that many bounds -- such as
path, spectral and Frobenius norms, flatness proxies, and deterministic
PAC-Bayes surrogates -- are fragile, this position paper also argues that
developers of new measures should explicitly audit them for fragility.

TL;DR: NeuroAda是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过在重要参数上引入旁路连接实现细粒度模型微调，仅需≤0.02%可训练参数就能达到最先进性能，同时减少高达60%的CUDA内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法存在权衡：基于添加的方法（如LoRA）内存效率高但表示能力有限，不适合细粒度适应；选择性原位适应方法允许精确有效适应但内存消耗显著增加。需要平衡这种权衡。

Method: 首先识别网络中的重要参数（如选择性适应），然后为这些选定参数引入旁路连接。在微调期间，仅更新旁路连接，保持原始模型参数冻结。

Result: 在23+个自然语言生成和理解任务上的实证结果表明，NeuroAda仅需≤0.02%可训练参数就能实现最先进的性能，同时将CUDA内存使用减少高达60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda成功解决了参数高效微调中的权衡问题，实现了细粒度模型微调同时保持高内存效率，在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

Method: 提出编码-分解范式：将编码表示分解为稳定表示和辅助表示；使用基于互信息的新度量替代传统的重构误差来识别异常。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

Motivation: 当前医疗实践依赖标准化治疗框架和经验方法，忽视患者个体差异，导致次优健康结果。需要开发能提供个性化临床建议的系统。

Method: 使用LLM处理非结构化医疗文本为结构化数据，CTGAN生成合成患者数据，T-learner预测患者特异性治疗反应，上下文bandit优化在线治疗选择。

Result: LLM处理准确率93.2%，CTGAN生成数据55%准确率，T-learner预测84.3%准确率，KernelUCB在5000轮中获得0.60-0.61平均奖励分数，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该系统克服了在线学习环境中的冷启动限制，提高了计算效率，在实现针对特定患者特征的个性化医疗方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Current medical practice depends on standardized treatment frameworks and
empirical methodologies that neglect individual patient variations, leading to
suboptimal health outcomes. We develop a comprehensive system integrating Large
Language Models (LLMs), Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks
(CTGAN), T-learner counterfactual models, and contextual bandit approaches to
provide customized, data-informed clinical recommendations. The approach
utilizes LLMs to process unstructured medical narratives into structured
datasets (93.2% accuracy), uses CTGANs to produce realistic synthetic patient
data (55% accuracy via two-sample verification), deploys T-learners to forecast
patient-specific treatment responses (84.3% accuracy), and integrates
prior-informed contextual bandits to enhance online therapeutic selection by
effectively balancing exploration of new possibilities with exploitation of
existing knowledge. Testing on stage III colon cancer datasets revealed that
our KernelUCB approach obtained 0.60-0.61 average reward scores across 5,000
rounds, exceeding other reference methods. This comprehensive system overcomes
cold-start limitations in online learning environments, improves computational
effectiveness, and constitutes notable progress toward individualized medicine
adapted to specific patient characteristics.

Abstract: In animals, category learning enhances discrimination between stimuli close
to the category boundary. This phenomenon, called categorical perception, was
also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on
classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on neuroscience data, we
show that this expansion/compression is a necessary outcome of efficient
learning. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial networks. We
show that minimizing the Bayes cost (mean of the cross-entropy loss) implies
maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural
activities prior to the decision layer. Considering structured data with an
underlying feature space of small dimension, we show that maximizing the mutual
information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and, (ii)
building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is
based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural
activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural
Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the
sensitivity of the category membership. Category learning thus induces an
expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. We characterize the
properties of the categorical Fisher information, showing that its eigenvectors
give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We
find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near,
the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST dataset, we
numerically illustrate how after learning the two Fisher information matrices
match, and essentially align with the category boundaries. Finally, we relate
our approach to the Information Bottleneck one, and we exhibit a bias-variance
decomposition of the Bayes cost, of interest on its own.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的决策树泛化方法——形状泛化树(SGT)，通过在每个内部节点应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数来实现非线性分割，在保持可解释性的同时提升性能并减小模型规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策树依赖简单的轴对齐线性分割，需要深层复杂结构来捕捉非线性特征效应，这削弱了模型的可解释性。

Method: 提出了SGT框架，每个内部节点对单个特征应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数；开发了ShapeCART算法来学习SGT；进一步扩展到双变量形状函数(S²GT)和多路树(SGT_K)。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SGT相比传统轴对齐线性树实现了更优越的性能，同时减少了模型规模。

Conclusion: SGT通过引入可学习的形状函数，在保持决策树可解释性的同时，显著提升了模型性能并减小了复杂度，为可解释机器学习提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦学习后门攻击方法基于规则选择关键层，没有考虑层间相互关系，导致攻击效果不佳且容易被先进防御机制检测到。

Method: 提出POLAR框架，采用轻量级伯努利采样的强化学习方法，动态学习攻击策略，通过策略梯度更新优化层选择，并引入正则化约束限制修改层数以保持隐蔽性。

Result: 实验表明POLAR在对抗六种最先进防御方法时，比最新攻击方法性能提升高达40%。

Conclusion: POLAR证明了强化学习在联邦学习后门攻击中的有效性，能够动态优化层选择策略，在保持隐蔽性的同时显著提高攻击成功率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

*Atli Kosson,Jeremy Welborn,Yang Liu,Martin Jaggi,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现Maximal Update Parameterization (muP)的学习率缩放规则仅在训练初期有效，而权重衰减才是真正稳定内部表示更新动态的关键因素，这挑战了当前关于学习率传递的主流观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何将小神经网络的最优学习率有效传递到大网络中，以解决超参数调优成本过高的问题，特别是检验muP参数化方法的理论基础和实际效果。

Method: 通过大规模实证研究，分析muP假设在实际训练中的有效性，比较muP与权重衰减在不同训练阶段对内部表示更新动态的影响。

Result: muP的假设仅在训练初期成立，而在大部分训练过程中，权重衰减才是稳定更新动态的关键；muP主要起到隐式学习率预热的作用，可以被修改的预热计划替代。

Conclusion: 权重衰减而非muP是实现学习率传递的核心机制，这解释了为什么muP需要独立权重衰减变体才能成功传递学习率，挑战了现有认知。

Abstract: Transferring the optimal learning rate from small to large neural networks
can enable efficient training at scales where hyperparameter tuning is
otherwise prohibitively expensive. To this end, the Maximal Update
Parameterization (muP) proposes a learning rate scaling designed to keep the
update dynamics of internal representations stable across different model
widths. However, the scaling rules of muP rely on strong assumptions,
particularly about the geometric alignment of a layer's inputs with both its
weights and gradient updates. In this large-scale empirical investigation, we
show that these assumptions hold only briefly at the start of training in the
practical setups where learning rate transfer is most valuable, such as LLM
training. For the remainder of training it is weight decay rather than muP that
correctly stabilizes the update dynamics of internal representations across
widths, facilitating learning rate transfer. This suggests muP's scaling
primarily acts as a form of implicit learning rate warmup, allowing us to
largely replace it with modified warmup schedules. Together these findings
fundamentally challenge prevailing beliefs about learning rate transfer and can
explain empirical practice such as why muP requires the independent weight
decay variant for successful transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决课程学习中存在的核心问题：何时课程学习有效？前向还是反向课程更好？答案是否取决于评估指标？

Method: 使用统一离线评估框架，将课程难度分解为五个维度：问题难度、模型惊讶度、置信度边际、预测不确定性和决策变异性，在数学推理基准上对Llama3.1-8B、Mistral-7B和Gemma3-4B进行受控后训练实验。

Result: 发现(i)没有通用主导的课程策略，(ii)同一指标内不同难度样本根据任务需求产生不同增益，(iii)任务对齐课程关注最终表示和泛化，而内部状态课程调节置信度和不确定性等内部状态。

Conclusion: 挑战了通用课程策略的概念，为不同模型和任务提供可操作指导，某些指标表明优先处理决策不确定样本可进一步改善学习效果。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

TL;DR: MetaCluster框架通过元学习器和聚类技术显著压缩KANs的参数存储，实现高达80倍的压缩率而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs虽然提升了表达能力和准确性，但参数和内存需求呈乘法增长，需要有效的压缩方法。

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器将低维嵌入映射到系数向量，通过K-means聚类将边缘向量替换为共享质心，最后微调质心码本。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，MetaCluster实现了高达80倍的参数存储减少，且精度无损失。

Conclusion: MetaCluster成功解决了KANs参数膨胀问题，为高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

Result: 实验表明该方法在半合成网络数据集上优于静态方法和忽略这种权衡的上下文赌博机方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法能够有效平衡学习过程中的探索与利用，在准确估计同伴影响力概率的同时控制遗憾增长。

Abstract: In networked environments, users frequently share recommendations about
content, products, services, and courses of action with others. The extent to
which such recommendations are successful and adopted is highly contextual,
dependent on the characteristics of the sender, recipient, their relationship,
the recommended item, and the medium, which makes peer influence probabilities
highly heterogeneous. Accurate estimation of these probabilities is key to
understanding information diffusion processes and to improving the
effectiveness of viral marketing strategies. However, learning these
probabilities from data is challenging; static data may capture correlations
between peer recommendations and peer actions but fails to reveal influence
relationships. Online learning algorithms can learn these probabilities from
interventions but either waste resources by learning from random exploration or
optimize for rewards, thus favoring exploration of the space with higher
influence probabilities. In this work, we study learning peer influence
probabilities under a contextual linear bandit framework. We show that a
fundamental trade-off can arise between regret minimization and estimation
error, characterize all achievable rate pairs, and propose an
uncertainty-guided exploration algorithm that, by tuning a parameter, attains
any pair within this trade-off. Our experiments on semi-synthetic network
datasets show the advantages of our method over static methods and contextual
bandits that ignore this trade-off.

Motivation: 现有可控音乐生成方法通常需要重新训练模型或会产生可听伪影，因此需要一种能够对冻结预训练模型进行精细控制且不影响生成质量的方法。

Method: 使用递归特征机器分析模型内部梯度，发现音乐概念方向；训练轻量级RFM探针识别MusicGen隐藏状态中的概念方向；在推理时将这些方向注入模型进行实时引导，无需每步优化。

Result: 将目标音符生成准确率从0.23提升到0.82，同时文本提示遵循度保持在未引导基线的约0.02范围内，实现了有效控制且对提示保真度影响最小。

Conclusion: MusicRFM成功平衡了控制与生成质量之间的权衡，为音乐领域的RFM应用提供了有效框架，并发布了代码以促进进一步探索。

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Granger因果分析基于线性模型，难以检测非线性因果关系，且依赖因果充分性和已知干预目标两个关键假设。现实中时间序列数据常存在潜在混淆变量和异质环境，缺乏干预先验知识。

Method: 提出不变Granger因果性(InvarGC)，利用跨环境异质性减轻潜在混淆影响，以边级别粒度区分干预与非干预环境，恢复不变因果关系。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 建立了这些条件下的可识别性，InvarGC能够有效解决传统Granger因果分析的局限性。

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 使用GPT-2的师生设置进行系统性研究，分析缩放规律、阈值和机制，包括解释性分析来理解腐败过程。

Result: 三个关键发现：(1)潜意识腐败导致行为交叉污染，降低模型整体对齐性；(2)对齐性在污染数据临界阈值处发生急剧相变；(3)腐败机制模仿自然微调过程，难以检测。

Conclusion: 结果表明依赖合成数据的AI系统存在关键漏洞，需要能够应对潜在威胁的新安全协议。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

Motivation: 解决模型微调中的灾难性遗忘问题，特别是当下游领域数据有限或与预训练分布差异较大时，现有参数高效微调方法在权重空间操作可能导致模型过度专业化，覆盖预训练知识。

Method: 提出特征空间适配方法，包括LoRFA（低秩特征适配）和VeFA（基于向量的特征适配），通过轻量级特征级变换补偿下游潜伏变量的影响，保留预训练表示。

Result: 在图像分类、自然语言理解和生成任务上评估，特征空间适配方法在标准微调指标上达到可比结果，并在鲁棒性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 特征空间适配能有效保留预训练知识，提升模型在分布偏移下的泛化能力，相比权重空间方法具有更好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整合多样化数据对改善多学科科学探索至关重要，需要开发能够准确分类小鼠在环境中各种行为的方法，为跨学科研究提供支持。

Method: 使用开源Qwen2.5-VL模型，通过提示工程、上下文学习（ICL）和帧级预处理来增强性能，无需模型微调。

Result: 每种方法都有助于改进分类性能，组合使用时在所有行为类别（包括罕见的冻结和逃跑行为）上都获得了较高的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该模型将支持跨学科研究人员整合跨多个时间点和环境的多样化行为特征，构建能够解决复杂研究问题的综合数据集。

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

Motivation: NGVI在变分推断中应用广泛且经验成功，但其理论基础有限，特别是在非共轭似然情况下，变分损失变为非凸且难以分析。

Method: 针对均值场参数化，首先推导了变分损失满足相对光滑性的充分条件；然后提出了包含非欧投影的改进NGVI算法；最后在额外结构假设下揭示了变分损失的隐藏凸性。

Result: 证明了改进算法的全局非渐近收敛到驻点，并在特定条件下建立了NGVI到全局最优的快速全局收敛。

Conclusion: 这些结果为NGVI在挑战性推断设置中的几何结构和收敛行为提供了新的理论见解。

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

TL;DR: 多任务后训练中，不同任务产生的梯度大小存在显著差异，导致优化偏向大梯度任务，但这种梯度不平衡与学习收益不成正比，需要梯度级别的修正方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务后训练通常假设所有任务贡献相似大小的梯度，但实际上某些任务会产生显著更大的梯度，导致优化偏向这些任务，这需要系统性的分析和解决方案。

Method: 通过分析RL后训练中不同任务的梯度大小和学习收益关系，发现梯度不平衡现象，并探究其与训练奖励、优势等统计量的关联。

Result: 大梯度任务的学习收益不一定更高，有时甚至低于小梯度任务；梯度不平衡无法用典型的训练统计量解释，而是源于任务间的固有差异。

Conclusion: 简单的数据集混合方法存在缺陷，需要开发基于梯度级别的修正方法来解决多任务后训练中的梯度不平衡问题。

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中通信受限的问题，降低通信负担同时维持系统协调性。

Method: 使用去中心化actor-critic学习框架，每个智能体在与其邻居交换信息前进行多次局部策略和值函数更新，值函数通过多层神经网络近似。

Result: 在马尔可夫采样下建立了有限时间收敛分析，达到ε精度稳定点的样本复杂度为O(ε⁻³)，通信复杂度为O(ε⁻¹τ⁻¹)，其中τ是局部训练步数。数值实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了多智能体强化学习的通信负担，同时保证了系统协调性和收敛性能，神经网络近似质量影响最终误差界限。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of reinforcement learning in multi-agent
systems where communication among agents is limited. We develop a decentralized
actor-critic learning framework in which each agent performs several local
updates of its policy and value function, where the latter is approximated by a
multi-layer neural network, before exchanging information with its neighbors.
This local training strategy substantially reduces the communication burden
while maintaining coordination across the network. We establish finite-time
convergence analysis for the algorithm under Markov-sampling. Specifically, to
attain the $\varepsilon$-accurate stationary point, the sample complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ and the communication complexity is of
order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1}\tau^{-1})$, where tau denotes the number of
local training steps. We also show how the final error bound depends on the
neural network's approximation quality. Numerical experiments in a cooperative
control setting illustrate and validate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: The analogy to heat diffusion has enhanced our understanding of information
flow in graphs and inspired the development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
However, most diffusion-based GNNs emulate passive heat diffusion, which still
suffers from over-smoothing and limits their ability to capture global graph
information. Inspired by the heat death of the universe, which posits that
energy distribution becomes uniform over time in a closed system, we recognize
that, without external input, node representations in a graph converge to
identical feature vectors as diffusion progresses. To address this issue, we
propose the Active Diffusion-based Graph Neural Network (ADGNN). ADGNN achieves
active diffusion by integrating multiple external information sources that
dynamically influence the diffusion process, effectively overcoming the
over-smoothing problem. Furthermore, our approach realizes true infinite
diffusion by directly calculating the closed-form solution of the active
diffusion iterative formula. This allows nodes to preserve their unique
characteristics while efficiently gaining comprehensive insights into the
graph's global structure. We evaluate ADGNN against several state-of-the-art
GNN models across various graph tasks. The results demonstrate that ADGNN
significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting its
effectiveness in capturing global graph information and maintaining node
distinctiveness.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) techniques have emerged as a powerful tool for
transferring expertise from complex teacher models to lightweight student
models, particularly beneficial for deploying high-performance models in
resource-constrained devices. This approach has been successfully applied to
graph neural networks (GNNs), harnessing their expressive capabilities to
generate node embeddings that capture structural and feature-related
information. In this study, we depart from the conventional KD approach by
exploring the potential of collaborative learning among GNNs. In the absence of
a pre-trained teacher model, we show that relatively simple and shallow GNN
architectures can synergetically learn efficient models capable of performing
better during inference, particularly in tackling multiple tasks. We propose a
collaborative learning framework where ensembles of student GNNs mutually teach
each other throughout the training process. We introduce an adaptive logit
weighting unit to facilitate efficient knowledge exchange among models and an
entropy enhancement technique to improve mutual learning. These components
dynamically empower the models to adapt their learning strategies during
training, optimizing their performance for downstream tasks. Extensive
experiments conducted on three datasets each for node and graph classification
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 将机器遗忘重新构建为多目标优化问题，并通过CUP算法实现可控的遗忘过程，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，SPOT实现了显著加速，可扩展到状态数更多的更大MDP，生成可解释且紧凑的决策树策略。

Conclusion: 该方法同时实现了可解释性和可扩展性，比现有方法快一个数量级地提供高质量策略。

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

Motivation: 深度强化学习虽然性能出色但缺乏可解释性，限制了对其策略行为的信任。现有SILVER框架仅限于低维、二元动作领域，需要扩展到更复杂的环境。

Method: 首先从图像观察中提取紧凑特征表示，进行SHAP特征归因，然后使用RL引导标记生成行为一致的边界数据集，最后训练决策树和回归函数等替代模型来解释RL策略的决策结构。

Result: 在两个Atari环境中使用三种深度RL算法进行评估，结果显示该方法在保持竞争性任务性能的同时，显著提高了透明度和人类对智能体行为的理解。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过将SILVER转变为可扩展且行为感知的框架，推进了可解释RL的发展，能够在高维多动作设置中解释深度RL智能体。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) achieves remarkable performance but lacks
interpretability, limiting trust in policy behavior. The existing SILVER
framework (Li, Siddique, and Cao 2025) explains RL policy via Shapley-based
regression but remains restricted to low-dimensional, binary-action domains. We
propose SILVER with RL-guided labeling, an enhanced variant that extends SILVER
to multi-action and high-dimensional environments by incorporating the RL
policy's own action outputs into the boundary points identification. Our method
first extracts compact feature representations from image observations,
performs SHAP-based feature attribution, and then employs RL-guided labeling to
generate behaviorally consistent boundary datasets. Surrogate models, such as
decision trees and regression-based functions, are subsequently trained to
interpret RL policy's decision structure. We evaluate the proposed framework on
two Atari environments using three deep RL algorithms and conduct human-subject
study to assess the clarity and trustworthiness of the derived interpretable
policy. Results show that our approach maintains competitive task performance
while substantially improving transparency and human understanding of agent
behavior. This work advances explainable RL by transforming SILVER into a
scalable and behavior-aware framework for interpreting deep RL agents in
high-dimensional, multi-action settings.

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

applies interventions at three levels: (i) structure-level edge reweighting,

Conclusion: 注意力知识可以有效迁移到循环模型中，使Transformer的专业知识能够快速用于构建更强的SSM社区

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer
expertise for building a stronger SSM community.

*Sehyun Park,Jongjin Lee,Yunseop Shin,Ilsang Ohn,Yongdai Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种名为高斯蒸馏的新方法，通过深度潜在因子模型将教师集成压缩为学生分布，而不是学生集成，以解决知识蒸馏中不确定性保持的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度集成在不确定性量化方面表现优异，但计算和内存需求大，难以部署到实际应用中。现有的知识蒸馏方法在压缩模型时难以保持不确定性，因为减小DNN尺寸通常会导致方差减小。

Method: 使用深度潜在因子模型（DLF）将教师集成视为某个随机过程的实现，通过期望最大化（EM）算法稳定估计DLF模型的均值和协方差函数，实现从教师集成到学生分布的压缩。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，高斯蒸馏方法优于现有基线方法，并且在语言模型微调和分布偏移问题上也表现良好。

Conclusion: 高斯蒸馏提供了一种有效的分布蒸馏方法，能够成功压缩教师集成并保持不确定性量化能力，适用于实际部署场景。

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

*Yang Zhang,Rui Zhang,Jiaming Guo,Lei Huang,Di Huang,Yunpu Zhao,Shuyao Cheng,Pengwei Jin,Chongxiao Li,Zidong Du,Xing Hu,Qi Guo,Yunji Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出信号感知学习(QiMeng-SALV)方法，通过利用功能正确输出信号的代码片段来优化Verilog代码生成的强化学习训练，解决了功能奖励不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在Verilog代码生成方面显示出潜力，但缺乏有意义的功能奖励阻碍了基于强化学习的偏好优化，难以生成功能正确的Verilog代码。

Method: 从部分错误模块中提取已验证的信号感知实现，通过比较生成模块与参考模块的信号功能正确性，使用抽象语法树识别信号感知代码片段，引入信号感知DPO在正确信号级代码段上进行优化。

Result: 在VerilogEval和RTLLM上实现最先进性能，7B参数模型匹配DeepSeek v3 671B模型的性能，并显著优于在同一数据集上训练的开源模型CodeV。

Conclusion: QiMeng-SALV标志着从传统模块级优化向细粒度信号级优化的范式转变，有效解决了功能奖励不足的问题。

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

*Mingyu Jo,Jaesik Yoon,Justin Deschenaux,Caglar Gulcehre,Sungjin Ahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜在路径在离散扩散模型中保留分布信息，显著提升生成质量，缩小与非自回归模型的差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散模型在采样时一旦进行类别采样，丰富的分布信息就会坍缩为one-hot向量，无法在步骤间传播，导致后续步骤信息受限

Method: 引入Loopholing机制，通过确定性潜在路径保留分布信息，采用自条件策略高效训练LDDMs模型

Result: 生成困惑度降低61%，在算术推理任务上表现提升，产生更连贯的文本，缓解了空闲步骤和振荡问题

Conclusion: Loopholing为高质量非自回归文本生成提供了可扩展的路径

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Motivation: 传统物种监测方法覆盖范围有限且不完整，需要更精确的物种分布模型来支持保护工作。

Method: 使用深度学习和数据插补技术，结合数据平衡和特征选择，构建多模态集成模型，整合土地覆盖、NDVI等环境变量。

Result: 数据平衡使MAE从189降至29；多模态模型在栖息地分类中达到84.9%准确率和0.90 AUC；特征选择识别了关键环境因素。

Conclusion: 多模态学习和数据预处理技术能够显著改善生态预测模型，为稀疏或不完整数据下的生物多样性监测提供更精确和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在决策和风险评估中需要高度可靠的预测，校准对于临床预测等关键决策至关重要，但通常被忽视。

Method: 利用学习到的输入样本表示的聚类，训练校准函数集成，并引入匹配度量来同时优化判别和校准性能。

Result: 将各种方法的校准分数从82.28%提升到100%，在常用校准方法上展现出灵活性和优越性能。

Conclusion: 该通用方案适应任何底层表示、聚类、校准方法和度量，提供灵活性并在校准性能上表现优异。

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

Motivation: 解决长上下文推理场景中的I/O和计算开销问题，通过混合注意力架构优化推理成本。

Method: 采用线性注意力和softmax注意力的混合架构，系统探索不同注意力机制的比例，并使用自研的FP8算子库linghe提升训练效率。

Result: 相比32B密集模型推理成本降低到1/10，相比原Ring系列成本降低50%以上，在多个复杂推理基准测试中保持SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Ring-linear模型系列通过混合注意力架构和高效训练技术，实现了长上下文推理场景下的显著成本优化和性能提升。

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)的预测形式对实际应用价值的影响，指出虽然这些模型在预测精度上表现良好，但预测形式(点预测、分位数预测、参数预测或轨迹集成)决定了其能支持的操作任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型主要关注预测精度，但忽略了预测形式对实际应用价值的关键影响。许多操作任务需要轨迹集成预测来保持时间依赖性，而大多数模型只提供点预测或参数预测。

Method: 作者调查了近期的时间序列基础模型，建立了预测类型之间转换的理论框架，证明了边际分布无法确定路径依赖事件概率，并提出了任务对齐的评估框架。

Result: 研究发现三分之二的TSFMs只产生点预测或参数预测，而许多操作任务需要轨迹集成预测。作者证明了边际分布相同的无限多联合分布会对操作问题给出不同答案。

Conclusion: 预测形式而非精度决定了实际效用，作者提供了将六种基本预测任务映射到最小充分预测类型的方法，为任务对齐的模型评估提供了框架。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种与常规对抗样本相反的概念——负对抗样本，这些样本与原始样本显著不同但产生相同预测结果，并开发了NI-FGSM、NI-FGM等算法来生成此类样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗样本是在原始样本附近添加微小扰动导致模型误分类，而本文探索相反方向：寻找与原始样本显著不同但仍被模型正确分类的样本，以揭示模型决策边界的更完整特性。

Method: 提出了负迭代快速梯度符号法(NI-FGSM)、负迭代快速梯度法(NI-FGM)及其动量变体(NMI-FGSM、NMI-FGM)，这些算法通过反向优化过程生成与原始样本差异最大化但预测结果相同的对抗样本。

Result: 生成的负对抗样本不仅存在于原始样本邻域，而是广泛分布在样本空间中，表明模型决策边界具有更复杂的几何特性。这些样本在特定场景下可用于攻击机器学习系统。

Conclusion: 对抗样本的分布不仅限于原始样本附近，而是遍布整个样本空间，这为理解模型鲁棒性和安全性提供了新的视角，所提出的负对抗样本生成方法具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Most machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which
poses security concerns on these models. Adversarial examples are crafted by
applying subtle but intentionally worst-case modifications to examples from the
dataset, leading the model to output a different answer from the original
example. In this paper, adversarial examples are formed in an exactly opposite
manner, which are significantly different from the original examples but result
in the same answer. We propose a novel set of algorithms to produce such
adversarial examples, including the negative iterative fast gradient sign
method (NI-FGSM) and the negative iterative fast gradient method (NI-FGM),
along with their momentum variants: the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient sign method (NMI-FGSM) and the negative momentum iterative fast
gradient method (NMI-FGM). Adversarial examples constructed by these methods
could be used to perform an attack on machine learning systems in certain
occasions. Moreover, our results show that the adversarial examples are not
merely distributed in the neighbourhood of the examples from the dataset;
instead, they are distributed extensively in the sample space.

Motivation: 分支定界法的性能很大程度上取决于变量选择启发式方法，现有研究尝试用强化学习学习最优分支策略，但需要更原则性的MDP公式来利用广泛的RL算法。

Method: 提出了BBMDP，一个用于分支定界变量选择的纯MDP公式，允许使用各种RL算法来学习最优分支启发式策略。

Result: 计算实验验证了模型的有效性，作者的分支代理在四个标准MILP基准测试中优于先前最先进的RL代理。

Conclusion: BBMDP提供了一个原则性的MDP框架，能够有效利用RL算法学习分支定界中的最优变量选择策略，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a powerful framework used to
address a wide range of NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, often
solved by Branch and Bound (B&B). A key factor influencing the performance of
B&B solvers is the variable selection heuristic governing branching decisions.
Recent contributions have sought to adapt reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithms to the B&B setting to learn optimal branching policies, through
Markov Decision Processes (MDP) inspired formulations, and ad hoc convergence
theorems and algorithms. In this work, we introduce BBMDP, a principled vanilla
MDP formulation for variable selection in B&B, allowing to leverage a broad
range of RL algorithms for the purpose of learning optimal B\&B heuristics.
Computational experiments validate our model empirically, as our branching
agent outperforms prior state-of-the-art RL agents on four standard MILP
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 提出的Scalable LinUCB算法能够显著降低线性上下文赌博机的计算和内存开销，同时保持性能

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

Conclusion: 该框架在严重环境干扰下表现出鲁棒性，适用于网络物理系统中的安全和智能导航。

Abstract: Data-driven inertial sequence learning has revolutionized navigation in
GPS-denied environments, offering superior odometric resolution compared to
traditional Bayesian methods. However, deep learning-based inertial tracking
systems remain vulnerable to privacy breaches that can expose sensitive
training data. \hl{Existing differential privacy solutions often compromise
model performance by introducing excessive noise, particularly in
high-frequency inertial measurements.} In this article, we propose ConvXformer,
a hybrid architecture that fuses ConvNeXt blocks with Transformer encoders in a
hierarchical structure for robust inertial navigation. We propose an efficient
differential privacy mechanism incorporating adaptive gradient clipping and
gradient-aligned noise injection (GANI) to protect sensitive information while
ensuring model performance. Our framework leverages truncated singular value
decomposition for gradient processing, enabling precise control over the
privacy-utility trade-off. Comprehensive performance evaluations on benchmark
datasets (OxIOD, RIDI, RoNIN) demonstrate that ConvXformer surpasses
state-of-the-art methods, achieving more than 40% improvement in positioning
accuracy while ensuring $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy guarantees. To
validate real-world performance, we introduce the Mech-IO dataset, collected
from the mechanical engineering building at KAIST, where intense magnetic
fields from industrial equipment induce significant sensor perturbations. This
demonstrated robustness under severe environmental distortions makes our
framework well-suited for secure and intelligent navigation in cyber-physical
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多系统会随时间老化或退化，但传感器数据中可能没有直接反映'年龄'的信息。需要从现有多变量时间序列中发现能够代表系统老化趋势的潜在代理特征。

Method: 使用精心定义的语法生成候选公式，通过优化公式的单调性（定义为时间与候选公式之间的绝对Spearman秩相关系数）来评估和选择最佳代理特征。

Result: 在人工生成数据集和两个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够将个体单调性较低（Spearman ρ值0.13和0.09）的传感器组合成单调性很高（Spearman ρ值0.95）的代理特征。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够发现可解释的公式，这些公式可以作为系统'年龄'的有效代理，在结构健康监测等应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.

TL;DR: ADAligner是一个动态、质量感知的图-文本对齐框架，通过实时评估监督质量来动态调整多对多和一对一对齐策略，解决了现有方法在噪声监督下的脆弱性和表达能力限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP风格图-文本对齐方法存在两个关键限制：假设严格的节点-文本一对一对应关系，忽略了现实图中固有的多对多关系；依赖静态对齐目标无法适应不同数据质量，在噪声监督下表现脆弱。

Method: ADAligner框架动态评估批次级对齐可靠性，并根据监督质量自适应优化策略：在干净监督下促进软性的子图级多对多对齐，在噪声情况下通过动态过滤低置信度对来强调可靠的一对一对齐。

Result: 在九个不同的TAG数据集上的综合实验表明，ADAligner在零样本/少样本节点分类、链接预测和跨模态检索任务上持续优于现有图-文本对齐方法，在噪声监督下保持强鲁棒性，相比多模态基线加速预训练约2-3倍。

Conclusion: ADAligner为现实网络环境中的图-文本表示学习建立了可扩展且可靠的基础，通过动态质量感知机制解决了图-文本对齐中的核心困境。

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

*Songqi Zhou,Zeyuan Liu,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairNet是一个新颖的动态公平性校正框架，通过结合偏置检测器和条件低秩适配，实现实例级别的选择性公平性校正，同时保持无偏实例的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法通常牺牲模型性能、依赖静态校正策略、难以处理数据稀疏问题，特别是少数群体数据，且对敏感属性的利用不够优化。

Method: FairNet整合偏置检测器和条件LoRA，仅对识别为有偏的实例激活公平性校正机制；提出新的对比损失函数，最小化不同敏感群体间的类内表示差异；可灵活处理完整、部分或缺失的敏感属性标签。

Result: 理论分析表明，在偏置检测器具有中等TPR/FPR时，FairNet能提升最差群体的性能而不降低整体性能，甚至可能带来轻微性能提升。在多种视觉和语言基准测试中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: FairNet提供了一个动态、实例级别的公平性校正解决方案，能有效解决现有方法的局限性，在保持整体性能的同时提升少数群体的公平性。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CPSVD方法，通过智能分割参数矩阵来改进基于SVD的LLM压缩，直接保留高分解误差的列，仅对低分解误差列应用SVD，并自适应分配非均匀压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD方法统一处理整个参数矩阵，忽略了不同矩阵部分SVD近似误差的显著差异，导致次优压缩效果。

Method: CPSVD方法识别并直接保留高分解误差的矩阵列，仅对低分解误差列应用SVD，精确确定两种策略的最佳平衡点以最小化误差，并自适应分配非均匀压缩率。

Result: 大量实验表明CPSVD在零样本任务上始终优于最先进的基于SVD的LLM压缩方法，实现更低的困惑度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: CPSVD通过智能矩阵分割和自适应压缩率分配，显著提升了SVD在LLM压缩中的性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习推断条件后验模型是鲁棒元学习的关键步骤，需要解决多任务少样本学习中的功能模糊性和不确定性。

Method: 使用低秩伯努利专家元模型进行内存高效的丢弃率映射，通过任务数据条件先验优化变分推断中的条件丢弃后验。

Result: 在1D随机回归、图像修复和分类等少样本学习任务中，NVDPs相比其他元学习方法表现出优异性能。

Conclusion: NVDPs能够稳健地近似任务特定的丢弃率，处理广泛的功能模糊性和不确定性，实现快速任务适应。

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出自适应秩分配(ARA)方法解决大语言模型SVD压缩中的秩分配问题，通过专用掩码设计和额外损失函数实现全局最优解，在80%压缩比下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法存在局限：启发式算法搜索空间受限，基于掩码的训练难以有效捕捉奇异值谱与参数关系，且忽略增益函数在压缩比为1时的非光滑特性，导致训练陷入局部最优。

Method: ARA方法包含：(1)专用掩码设计，实现保留秩与可训练参数之间的高效映射和更新；(2)额外损失函数，引导参数选择朝向全局最优解。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B模型80%压缩比下，WikiText2困惑度从8.38降至6.42，零样本任务平均准确率相比均匀压缩提升9.72个百分点。

Conclusion: ARA方法在SVD基LLM压缩中实现了最先进的秩分配性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

Conclusion: 思维链监控为AI安全提供了一种有前景的替代方法，通过系统化的监控和检测机制来应对日益复杂的AI风险。

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

Conclusion: IFeF-PINN方法能有效克服谱偏差，提高整个频域的近似精度，在物理信息神经网络训练中表现优异

Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency
features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose
IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced
features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency
components through Random Fourier Features. This creates a two-stage training
problem: (i) estimate a basis in the feature space, and (ii) perform regression
to determine the coefficients of the enhanced basis functions. For an
underlying linear model, it is shown that the latter problem is convex, and we
prove that the iterative training scheme converges. Furthermore, we empirically
establish that Random Fourier Features enhance the expressive capacity of the
network, enabling accurate approximation of high-frequency PDEs. Through
extensive numerical evaluation on classical benchmark problems, the superior
performance of our method over state-of-the-art algorithms is shown, and the
improved approximation across the frequency domain is illustrated.

Conclusion: INPO框架成功解决了图遗忘过程中模型效用下降的问题，通过减缓发散速度和保持拓扑结构完整性实现了更好的遗忘效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

Motivation: 现有遗忘学习方法依赖梯度上升来降低特定目标响应的概率，但会导致概率质量重新分配到高似然区域（语义相关的重述），形成"挤压效应"，造成虚假遗忘。

Method: 提出自举框架BS，将挤压效应与模型自身高置信度生成（模型信念）联系起来。BS-T抑制高概率token，BS-S移除整个高置信度生成，联合抑制目标响应和模型信念。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和多种模型家族上的广泛实验证实了该方法的有效性，能够实现更彻底的遗忘同时保持实用性。

Conclusion: 通过直接针对挤压效应的根本原因——模型信念，提出的自举框架能够实现更真实有效的遗忘学习，解决了现有方法中虚假遗忘的问题。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

Conclusion: REBMBO通过强化学习驱动的多步前瞻策略，有效克服了传统贝叶斯优化的局限性，在复杂优化任务中表现出色

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Method: 在不同数据集上测试对抗鲁棒模型的表示相似性和预测行为，分析分类层对预测差异的影响，并通过重新训练分类器来验证预测普适性的可提升性。

Result: 验证了Jones关于特定设置下高表示相似性的主要主张，但结果在不同数据集间不一致；预测行为不会随鲁棒性增加而收敛；预测差异主要源于分类层；通过简单重新训练分类器可以实现更普适的预测行为。

Conclusion: 神经网络在特定设置下具有部分普适性，但不存在严格的普适性概念；分类层是预测差异的关键因素，但可以通过调整来提高预测一致性。

Abstract: The modified universality hypothesis proposed by Jones et al. (2022) suggests
that adversarially robust models trained for a given task are highly similar.
We revisit the hypothesis and test its generality. While we verify Jones' main
claim of high representational similarity in specific settings, results are not
consistent across different datasets. We also discover that predictive behavior
does not converge with increasing robustness and thus is not universal. We find
that differing predictions originate in the classification layer, but show that
more universal predictive behavior can be achieved with simple retraining of
the classifiers. Overall, our work points towards partial universality of
neural networks in specific settings and away from notions of strict
universality.

Conclusion: 联邦聚类方法能够有效解构和表示分布式分子数据，但需要结合领域知识和化学信息评估指标才能获得更好的分析效果。

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

Conclusion: g-DPO通过智能训练对选择和计算优化，有效解决了DPO的可扩展性问题，在大数据集上预期会有更大的加速效果。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

Conclusion: ELUTQ框架通过HLQ格式有效解决了边缘设备上LLM部署的量化挑战，在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

TL;DR: SpikeQuant是一种基于脉冲神经网络的混合精度量化方法，通过将显著激活值重新编码为二进制脉冲计数，并将量化尺度嵌入IF机制阈值，实现高效能的大语言模型部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统量化方法的三个挑战：MAC操作能耗高、反量化引入额外开销、统一比特宽度会裁剪显著值。受脉冲神经网络二进制表示和IF机制的启发，寻求更节能的解决方案。

Method: 选择性对显著激活值应用混合精度量化，将其重新编码为二进制脉冲计数，通过将量化尺度嵌入IF机制阈值来避免显式反量化操作。

Result: 在W4A4量化下保持接近FP16的困惑度，同时相比现有方法能耗降低高达4.6倍。

Conclusion: SpikeQuant在保持准确性的同时显著提升能效，为LLM在边缘设备上的部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

Abstract: Memory-efficient training of deep neural networks has become increasingly
important as models grow larger while deployment environments impose strict

leveraging two key insights: layer importance for updates is
architecture-dependent and determinable a priori, while dynamic stochastic
channel selection provides superior gradient approximation compared to static
approaches. We introduce a dynamic channel selection approach that
stochastically resamples channels between epochs within preselected layers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate TraDy achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various downstream tasks and architectures while maintaining strict

Conclusion: 多模型一致性方法能有效改进LLM幻觉问题，提供更好的性能且成本更低，值得在不同模型组合条件下推广应用。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

TL;DR: 提出Enhanced TimeAutoDiff框架，通过合成ICU时间序列数据来训练和评估预测模型，显著减少了真实数据与合成数据评估之间的差距，并在细粒度人口亚组中提供更准确的性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在重症监护领域，由于患者隐私和数据敏感性，获取足够真实数据来全面评估模型性能具有挑战性。需要一种隐私保护的方法来生成可信的合成数据，用于模型训练和评估。

Method: 基于先前的扩散模型和VAE生成器（TimeDiff、HealthGen、TimeAutoDiff），引入Enhanced TimeAutoDiff，在潜在扩散目标中增加了分布对齐惩罚项。在MIMIC-III和eICU数据集上对24小时死亡率和住院时间二元分类任务进行广泛基准测试。

Result: Enhanced TimeAutoDiff将真实数据与合成数据评估之间的差距（TRTS gap）减少了70%以上，达到ΔTRTS ≤ 0.014 AUROC，同时保持训练效用（ΔTSTR ≈ 0.01）。对于32个交叉亚组，大型合成队列将亚组级AUROC估计误差减少了50%，并在72-84%的亚组中优于小型真实测试集。

Conclusion: 这项工作为重症监护领域提供了一个实用的、隐私保护的路线图，用于可信的、细粒度的模型评估，能够在不同患者群体中进行稳健可靠的性能分析，而无需暴露敏感的电子健康记录数据，有助于提高医疗AI的整体可信度。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

Motivation: 传统两阶段方法存在预测-决策不对齐问题，且观测数据有偏差而实验数据稀缺，导致高方差估计。

Method: 开发了基于实验数据的无偏OR决策质量估计器，通过代理损失函数连接离散优化梯度；建立了双层优化框架，联合利用观测和实验数据，通过隐式微分求解。

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL能有效校正观测数据的学习方向，实现最优偏差-方差权衡，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

Conclusion: 语义世界模型方法能够继承预训练视觉语言模型的泛化和鲁棒性特性，为机器人控制提供更有效的规划能力。

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

Conclusion: MED-LQ展示了在大规模马尔可夫决策过程中更广泛应用潜力，扩展了CI和MED原则的应用范围。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

Conclusion: ForecastNet-XCL的效率、性能和不确定性感知设计使其成为在气候压力加剧和监测资源受限情况下的可部署预警工具。

Abstract: Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了快速设计迭代效率，为智能建筑设计中的安全优化提供了新见解和技术路径，降低了建模负担，支持大规模假设探索。

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

demonstrate: (i) scalability by enforcing weight sparsity on a 50 million
parameter model; (ii) imposing conservativeness constraints in score-based
generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next
iteration in developing differentiable linear-algebra tools and making them

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA通过显式分离任务相关特征和残差信息，有效提升了参数高效微调的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly

Motivation: 时变环境下估计异质性处理效应面临严重的数据重叠问题，因为观察到某些处理序列的概率随预测时间范围呈指数下降，导致现有元学习器在重叠不足时估计方差爆炸。

Conclusion: 提出的重叠加权正交元学习器为时变环境下的异质性处理效应估计提供了完全数据驱动的方法，具有模型无关性和对干扰函数错误设定的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

### [178] [Policy Learning with Abstention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19672)
*Ayush Sawarni,Jikai Jin,Justin Whitehouse,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种带弃权机制的政策学习方法，当预测不确定时可以弃权并采用默认策略，获得比随机猜测稍好的奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统政策学习方法在预测不确定时仍强制决策，这在高风险场景中很危险。需要允许政策在不确定时弃权，提高安全性。

Method: 提出两阶段学习器：首先识别一组近似最优政策，然后基于它们的分歧构建弃权规则。使用双重稳健目标处理未知倾向得分。

Result: 在已知倾向得分时获得O(1/n)型快速遗憾保证，在未知倾向得分时通过DR目标扩展这些保证。

Conclusion: 弃权是政策学习中的多功能工具，可在边际条件下改进保证、连接分布鲁棒政策学习，并支持安全政策改进。

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

*Amir Globerson,Haim Kaplan,Yishay Mansour,Clara Mohri,Tal Schuster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出分层推测解码(HSD)算法，通过构建多级草稿模型层次结构来并行验证token，显著降低Transformer语言模型的推理延迟，相比最佳单草稿模型基线获得1.2倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法通常只使用单个草稿模型，但在实践中存在多种不同速度和准确性的潜在草稿模型。为了充分利用这些模型资源，需要开发能够整合多个草稿模型的更高效解码算法。

Method: HSD算法将多个草稿模型堆叠成层次结构，每个模型提出token，下一个更大的模型在单次前向传播中验证这些token，最终由目标模型进行最终验证。

Result: 推导了任意层次结构的期望延迟表达式，证明选择延迟最优层次结构可以在多项式时间内完成。实验显示HSD相比最佳单草稿基线提供高达1.2倍的加速。

Conclusion: HSD算法通过利用多个草稿模型的层次结构，有效降低了生成延迟，超越了现有技术的性能表现，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEMPO是一个轻量级时间序列基础模型，通过能量感知频谱分解和混合提示Transformer，在减少预训练数据量和模型规模的同时，实现了强大的零样本和少样本预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型需要大规模预训练和复杂网络架构，难以在资源受限环境中部署，需要在通用性和可负担性之间找到平衡。

Method: 1) 能量感知频谱分解模块：同时建模高能量和低能量频率信号，提高预训练数据利用率；2) 混合提示Transformer：通过数据集特定提示学习异质时序模式，参数高效地适应不同数据集。

Result: 在两个大规模基准测试的16个数据集上，SEMPO在零样本和少样本预测场景中均优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: SEMPO显著减少了预训练数据规模和模型大小，同时保持了强大的泛化能力，为资源受限环境下的时间序列预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available
at https://github.com/mala-lab/SEMPO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文建立了在线最小二乘SGD线性泛函的非渐近Berry-Esseen界，在增长维度机制下提供高斯中心极限定理，显著扩展了先前工作的维度范围并提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中部署SGD需要严格量化其固有不确定性，现有高维推理方法计算成本高且维度缩放受限。

Method: 提出基于在线SGD的程序，在增长维度机制下建立非渐近Berry-Esseen界，并开发在线方差估计器。

Result: SGD迭代在迭代次数增长为t ≳ d^(1+δ)时满足CLT，运行时间为O(td)，内存需求为O(d)，优于现有方法的O(td² + d³)运行时间。

Conclusion: 该研究为在近最优缩放机制t ≳ d^(1+δ)下构建SGD迭代的置信区间提供了第一个完全在线和数据驱动的框架。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

Result: 贝叶斯深度学习方法显著提高了物种分布模型在数据稀缺位置的可靠性

Conclusion: 贝叶斯深度学习能够有效结合局部精细洞察与更广泛的生态模式，有助于生态理解和保护工作

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

*Qilin Ye,Deqing Fu,Robin Jia,Vatsal Sharan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文解释了Transformer在算法学习中的局限性，通过图连通性问题分析发现：Transformer倾向于学习简单启发式而非通用算法，其学习结果取决于训练数据的复杂度是否在模型容量范围内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer为何经常无法学习通用算法而依赖脆弱的启发式方法，以图连通性为测试平台，从理论和实证角度解释这一现象。

Method: 使用简化的Transformer架构（解耦Transformer），理论证明L层模型能解决直径不超过3^L的图问题，相当于计算邻接矩阵的幂。分析训练动态，研究不同复杂度训练数据对学习策略的影响。

Result: 发现当训练数据在模型容量范围内（直径≤3^L）时，模型学习正确的算法解决方案；当超出容量时，模型学习基于节点度的简单启发式。实证表明限制训练数据在模型容量内可使标准和解耦Transformer都学习精确算法。

Conclusion: Transformer学习算法的能力受限于其模型容量，通过适当限制训练数据的复杂度，可以促使模型学习通用算法而非简单启发式。

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

TL;DR: CONFEX是一种基于共形预测和混合整数线性规划的不确定性感知反事实解释方法，通过局部覆盖保证生成可靠的反事实解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法往往忽略不确定性或缺乏将不确定性纳入的机制，导致解释可能不可靠或在预测不确定性高的区域不适用。

Method: 结合共形预测和混合整数线性规划，开发了局部化CP程序，通过离线树基输入空间划分实现高效MILP编码。

Result: 在多个基准测试和指标上优于现有方法，生成的反事实解释具有鲁棒性和合理性。

Conclusion: CONFEX方法能够生成具有预测不确定性和最优性严格保证的可靠反事实解释。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需参考模型即可评估模型对成员推理攻击脆弱性的新方法，利用训练和测试分布的不对称性和重尾特性来预测风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的成员推理攻击需要训练大量计算昂贵的参考模型，限制了实用性，需要开发更高效的方法来评估模型隐私风险。

Method: 利用损失分布的不对称性和重尾特性，通过分析高损失区域异常值的缺失来预测模型脆弱性，使用简单的损失攻击的真负率来估计模型级脆弱性。

Result: 该方法在多种架构和数据集上都能准确估计模型对最先进MIA攻击(LiRA)的脆弱性，优于低成本的RMIA攻击和其他分布差异度量方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估模型隐私风险提供了一种高效实用的替代方案，特别在大型语言模型的风险评估方面显示出良好前景。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

TL;DR: GaLLoP是一种基于梯度的稀疏学习技术，仅微调下游任务中梯度幅度最大且预训练幅度最小的模型参数，在保持性能的同时减少参数更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏微调技术通过仅调整模型参数的稀疏子集来适应下游任务，但其有效性取决于最优选择要微调的参数。现有方法在参数选择上存在优化空间。

Method: 提出GaLLoP方法，选择具有最大梯度幅度（任务相关性强）和最小预训练幅度（对预训练知识破坏小）的参数进行微调。

Result: 在LLaMA3 8B和Gemma 2B上的实验表明，GaLLoP在分布内和分布外性能上均优于或匹配其他参数高效微调技术（LoRA、DoRA、SAFT），并减轻灾难性遗忘和任务数据记忆问题。

Conclusion: GaLLoP通过选择性地微调关键参数，实现了稳定性能、良好泛化能力，并保持了对预训练知识的保护。

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

Motivation: 传统数据驱动方法依赖I.I.D.数据假设，现有泛化技术需要环境标签，但这些标签在训练时往往不可得，因为数据采集困难、隐私问题和环境变化性。

Method: 提出DynaInfer方法，通过分析固定神经网络在每轮训练中的预测误差来自动推断环境规范，实现直接从数据中进行环境分配。

Result: 实验表明DynaInfer优于现有环境分配技术，能快速收敛到真实标签，甚至在环境标签可用时也能取得更优性能。

Conclusion: DynaInfer有效解决了无标签场景下的交替优化问题，为处理复杂动态系统中的环境差异提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing
complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving
the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental
differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on
environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data
acquisition challenges, privacy concerns, and environmental variability,
particularly in large public datasets and privacy-sensitive domains. In
response, we propose DynaInfer, a novel method that infers environment
specifications by analyzing prediction errors from fixed neural networks within
each training round, enabling environment assignments directly from data. We
prove our algorithm effectively solves the alternating optimization problem in
unlabeled scenarios and validate it through extensive experiments across
diverse dynamical systems. Results show that DynaInfer outperforms existing
environment assignment techniques, converges rapidly to true labels, and even
achieves superior performance when environment labels are available.

Motivation: 解决开源模型被他人修改后难以证明其来源的问题，为模型版权保护提供统计证据。

Method: 使用独立性测试框架，通过查询设置（直接评估模型对训练数据的似然）和观察设置（分析文本与训练数据的重叠或不同版本模型的似然）来检测相关性。

Result: 在查询设置中，对40多个微调模型进行测试，p值大多低于1e-8；在观察设置中，第二种方法仅需几百个token就能可靠区分，第一种方法需要数十万个token。

Conclusion: 通过训练数据顺序相关性测试，可以有效证明模型派生关系，为模型溯源提供了可行的统计方法。

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer是否能够作为元学习器，仅使用少量上下文示例来适应新任务，而无需额外训练。现有理论分析大多未涉及正式的元学习设置。

Method: 使用简化Transformer架构，在类条件高斯混合模型的任务族上进行训练，其中均值向量位于共享的k维子空间中。通过梯度下降训练，分析其在元学习中的表现。

Result: 训练足够多任务后，Transformer仅需O(k/R^4)个上下文示例就能泛化到新任务，性能几乎匹配知道共享子空间的最优学习器，显著优于仅使用上下文数据的学习器（需要Ω(d/R^4)个示例）。

Conclusion: Transformer可以作为高效的元学习器，其训练任务数量和每个任务的示例数量与环境维度d无关，证明了Transformer在元学习中的理论优势。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练的计算需求加剧了全球南北之间的结构性不对称，研究旨在探索全球南方国家在硬件、能源和财政约束下实现AI技术主权的可行性。

Method: 采用双轴设计，比较不同加速器（NVIDIA H100 vs A100）和训练时长（90天 vs 150天），评估计算需求、能耗、资本支出和监管兼容性。

Result: 所有配置均低于出口管制和电力基础设施阈值，H100方案在800-1400万美元成本下可行，A100方案因更高能耗和硬件需求需1900-3200万美元。

Conclusion: 延长训练时间应作为缓解硬件约束的政策杠杆，使中等收入国家能够建立可持续且战略充足的AI能力，生产可用、可审计且本地对齐的模型。

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

Motivation: 轻量级EEG系统在实际应用中具有最佳的成本部署平衡，但空间稀疏性限制了空间保真度，影响学习效果并引入偏差。现有的EEG空间超分辨率方法受限于分布偏移和信号失真，降低了EEG分析和可视化的保真度和可用性。

Method: 提出SRGDiff模型，将EEG空间超分辨率建模为动态条件生成。核心思想是从低密度输入学习动态残差条件，预测逐步的时空细节，并使用演化线索引导去噪过程朝向高密度重建。在每个去噪步骤中，残差条件与先前去噪器特征图相加融合，然后通过步相关仿射调制缩放和移动激活以产生当前特征。

Result: 在SEED、SEED-IV和Localize-MI数据集上，使用信号级、特征级和下游级指标的全面评估协议显示，SRGDiff在多个上采样尺度上相比强基线方法实现了高达40%的持续增益。地形图可视化比较和显著的EEG-FID增益表明，该方法缓解了低密度和高密度记录之间的空间-频谱偏移。

Conclusion: SRGDiff在EEG空间超分辨率任务中表现出优越性，能够有效恢复高密度EEG信号，同时保持保真度和一致性平衡，为实际BCI应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: For real-world BCI applications, lightweight Electroencephalography (EEG)
systems offer the best cost-deployment balance. However, such spatial sparsity
of EEG limits spatial fidelity, hurting learning and introducing bias. EEG
spatial super-resolution methods aim to recover high-density EEG signals from
sparse measurements, yet is often hindered by distribution shift and signal
distortion and thus reducing fidelity and usability for EEG analysis and
visualization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware
residual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as
dynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual
condition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and
spatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process
toward high-density reconstructions. At each denoising step, the proposed
residual condition is additively fused with the previous denoiser feature maps,
then a step-dependent affine modulation scales and shifts the activation to
produce the current features. This iterative procedure dynamically extracts
step-wise temporal rhythms and spatial-topographic cues to steer high-density
recovery and maintain a fidelity-consistency balance. We adopt a comprehensive
evaluation protocol spanning signal-, feature-, and downstream-level metrics
across SEED, SEED-IV, and Localize-MI and multiple upsampling scales. SRGDiff
achieves consistent gains of up to 40% over strong baselines, proving its
superiority in the task of EEG spatial super-resolution. Moreover, topographic
visualizations comparison and substantial EEG-FID gains jointly indicate that
our SR EEG mitigates the spatial-spectral shift between low- and high-density
recordings.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is pivotal for drug
discovery, yet existing methods often fail to address challenges like
cross-domain generalization, cold-start prediction, and interpretability. In
this work, we propose CDI-DTI, a novel cross-domain interpretable framework for
DTI prediction, designed to overcome these limitations. By integrating
multi-modal features-textual, structural, and functional-through a
multi-strategy fusion approach, CDI-DTI ensures robust performance across
different domains and in cold-start scenarios. A multi-source cross-attention
mechanism is introduced to align and fuse features early, while a bidirectional
cross-attention layer captures fine-grained intra-modal drug-target
interactions. To enhance model interpretability, we incorporate Gram Loss for
feature alignment and a deep orthogonal fusion module to eliminate redundancy.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDI-DTI
significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in cross-domain and
cold-start tasks, while maintaining high interpretability for practical
applications in drug-target interaction prediction.
