### [1] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种学习框架，用于编辑视频中的生理信号（如心率）同时保持视觉保真度，以解决面部视频中生理信号带来的隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于摄像头的心率估计方法虽然方便，但面部视频中的生命体征信号会泄露个人健康和情绪状态等敏感信息，引发严重的隐私担忧。

Method: 使用预训练的3D变分自编码器将输入视频编码到潜在空间，通过冻结的文本编码器嵌入目标心率提示，使用可训练的时空层和自适应层归一化融合特征，在解码器中应用特征级线性调制和微调输出层来避免生理信号在重建过程中退化。

Result: 在选定数据集上平均PSNR为38.96 dB，SSIM为0.98，使用最先进的rPPG估计器实现了平均心率调制误差10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效控制心率编辑，可用于匿名化真实视频中的生物特征信号或合成具有所需生命体征的逼真视频。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [2] [FinCap: Topic-Aligned Captions for Short-Form Financial YouTube Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25745)
*Siddhant Sukhani,Yash Bhardwaj,Riya Bhadani,Veer Kejriwal,Michael Galarnyk,Sudheer Chava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估多模态大语言模型在金融短视频主题对齐字幕生成中的表现，测试了文本、音频、视频三种模态的七种组合，发现视频单独使用在四个主题上表现强劲，而某些双模态组合优于三模态组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立金融短视频字幕生成的基准，探索多模态模型在理解复杂视觉线索方面的潜力和挑战。

Method: 使用624个标注的YouTube短视频，测试文本(T)、音频(A)、视频(V)三种模态的七种组合方式，评估五个主题：主要推荐、情感分析、视频目的、视觉分析和金融实体识别。

Result: 视频单独使用在四个主题上表现强劲；某些双模态组合（如TV或AV）优于三模态TAV组合；过多模态可能引入噪声。

Conclusion: 建立了金融短视频字幕生成的第一个基准，展示了多模态模型在该领域的潜力，但也揭示了模态组合的复杂性挑战。

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on
our Github under the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

### [3] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA是一个基于扩散模型的文本到运动生成方法，通过双路径锚定机制解决语义对齐和运动伪影问题，在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于U-Net架构的扩散模型在文本到运动生成任务中存在语义错位和运动学伪影问题，深层网络梯度衰减导致高层特征学习不足。

Method: 提出LUMA模型，包含双路径锚定：1) 轻量级MoCLIP模型提供时间域语义监督；2) 从低频DCT分量提取频率域对齐信号。通过时间调制机制自适应融合两个锚点，在去噪过程中从粗对齐逐步过渡到细粒度语义优化。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别获得0.035和0.123的FID分数，达到最先进性能，收敛速度比基线快1.4倍。

Conclusion: LUMA通过双路径锚定机制有效解决了文本到运动生成中的语义对齐问题，是一个高效可扩展的高保真解决方案。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [4] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个新的视觉问答基准测试，包含2720个问题-答案对，专注于测试模型在密集场景中的基本视觉理解能力。测试显示当前最先进的视觉语言模型在复杂场景中表现不佳，最佳模型仅达到19.6%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试可能高估了视觉语言模型的性能，特别是在处理密集场景中的细节编码和推理方面仍存在挑战。作者希望通过这个新基准来暴露现有模型的局限性。

Method: 使用高分辨率的公共领域绘画扫描图像，这些图像包含多个人物、动作和复杂背景。手动标注了六类任务的问题，以全面测试场景理解能力。

Result: 测试了37个模型，最佳模型(o3)在最难测试集上仅达到19.6%准确率，所有问题上的总体准确率为69.5%。错误分析揭示了多种失败模式，包括计数能力不足、OCR失败和逻辑不一致。

Conclusion: VisualOverload揭示了当前视觉模型在密集场景理解方面的关键差距，为社区开发更好的模型提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [5] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的诊断基准，专注于视角转换的空间推理挑战，包含平移、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化等细粒度诊断类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在系统性弱点，如强烈的自我中心偏见、旋转理解能力差以及在对称和句法重构下的不一致性。需要开发专门的基准来诊断这些能力缺陷。

Method: 设计围绕视角转换核心挑战的基准，包含逐步结构化的任务类别，从单物体简单任务到多物体视角转换的最复杂设置。评估了37个最先进的专有和开源视觉语言模型。

Result: 评估结果显示模型存在系统性弱点，人类受试者达到91.2%的高准确率，人类反应时间与VLM准确率呈强相关性，表明基准捕捉了人类和VLM共享的空间推理挑战。

Conclusion: SpinBench为理解视觉语言模型的空间推理能力提供了关键见解，突出了它们在物理空间推理方面的关键差距，并展示了规模分析中的平滑改进和涌现能力。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [6] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了多模态时空变换器(MM-STT)，通过融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验，显著提升了高分辨率地面沉降预测性能，在EGMS数据集上实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如ConvLSTM难以建模长程依赖关系，且现有工作局限于单模态数据范式，无法充分利用多源信息进行准确预测。

Method: 设计了多模态时空变换器框架，采用联合时空注意力机制统一处理所有多模态特征，实现深度多模态融合。

Result: 在EGMS数据集上建立了新的最先进性能，相比包括STGCN和STAEformer在内的所有基线方法，将长程预测的RMSE降低了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 对于此类问题，架构固有的深度多模态融合能力对于实现变革性性能至关重要。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [7] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision language models (VLMs) can achieve expert-level accuracy in metric depth estimation without architecture changes, using text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels and addressing pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity through visual prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art VLMs struggle with 3D understanding from 2D inputs, while expert pure vision models achieve super-human accuracy in metric depth estimation but require task-specific architectures and losses. This motivates exploring whether VLMs can reach expert-level accuracy without such modifications.

Method: Uses text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels, visual prompting to address pixel reference, and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation to handle cross-dataset camera ambiguity. No dense prediction head or complex regression/regularization loss is needed.

Result: DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over 2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models. It naturally avoids over-smoothing and has fewer flying points at boundary regions than pure vision models.

Conclusion: VLMs can achieve expert-level 3D understanding accuracy without architecture or loss changes, and the simplicity of DepthLM enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth estimation.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [8] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于泛北极海冰浓度制图和不确定性量化的贝叶斯Transformer方法，融合多源卫星数据，能够生成高分辨率海冰图和可靠的uncertainty地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率泛北极海冰制图及其可靠的不确定性量化对于海冰浓度制图至关重要，但由于海冰特征微妙、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战而难以实现。

Method: 设计了一种新颖的高分辨率Transformer模型，包含全局和局部模块以更好识别海冰模式差异；提出贝叶斯扩展处理参数不确定性；在决策级融合Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2三种数据类型。

Result: 在2021年9月的泛北极数据集上测试，相比其他不确定性量化方法，该模型能够同时获得高分辨率海冰图和稳健的不确定性地图。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了泛北极海冰制图中的关键挑战，为海冰浓度制图提供了可靠的高分辨率解决方案。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于路边摄像头和LiDAR的传感器融合框架，使用卡尔曼滤波进行后期融合，在复杂道路环境中实现精确的车辆检测和定位，显著降低纵向误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施感知系统在复杂道路环境（如施工区）中面临的透视畸变、几何复杂、遮挡和成本等部署障碍。

Method: 集成路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器到协同仿真环境，开发可扩展的车辆检测和定位框架，采用基于卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略。

Result: 仿真中融合算法相比单个传感器将纵向误差降低达70%，横向精度保持在1-3米内；现场验证显示融合轨迹能准确匹配真实车辆路径，即使单传感器数据中断或降级。

Conclusion: 基于卡尔曼滤波的传感器融合能可靠补偿单个传感器局限，为复杂交通环境提供精确鲁棒的车辆跟踪能力，是实现基础设施支持的多传感器主动安全系统的实用途径。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

### [10] [Seeing Before Reasoning: A Unified Framework for Generalizable and Explainable Fake Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25502)
*Kaiqing Lin,Zhiyuan Yan,Ruoxin Chen,Junyan Ye,Ke-Yue Zhang,Yue Zhou,Peng Jin,Bin Li,Taiping Yao,Shouhong Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Forensic-Chat方法，通过"先观察后推理"的新范式提升多模态大语言模型检测AI生成图像的能力，解决现有方法因视觉感知不足导致的性能不佳问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在检测AI生成图像时表现不佳，根源在于视觉编码器主要针对语义识别优化，对低级别伪造痕迹不敏感，且微调数据格式与预训练分布差异大，导致模型依赖语言捷径而忘记预训练知识。

Method: 提出"先观察后推理"范式，首先训练MLLMs感知伪造痕迹，增强其伪迹感知能力，然后基于实际观察进行推理。开发了Forensic-Chat通用可解释对话助手和ExplainFake-Bench评估基准。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在泛化性和真实可靠的可解释性方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: 通过强化MLLMs的伪迹感知视觉能力，使其检测AI生成图像时能够基于实际观察进行推理，显著提升了检测性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

### [11] [DeepFake Detection in Dyadic Video Calls using Point of Gaze Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25503)
*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种利用视线追踪技术的实时深度伪造检测方法，通过分析视频会议中视线模式来识别深度伪造攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的进步，恶意行为者开始在视频会议中进行实时钓鱼攻击。由于视频通话可以获取深度伪造所'看到'的内容，结合恶意行为者视频流中的估计视线，可以检测深度伪造无法模仿的微妙非语言交流。

Method: 基于对二元对话中视线模式研究的仔细回顾，选择可解释的特征构建模型，利用之前不可用的生物特征信息。

Result: 在自建的新数据集上测试模型，达到了82%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个利用视线点追踪进行深度伪造检测的方法，为实时深度伪造检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

*Tu-Hoa Pham,Philip Bailey,Daniel Posada,Georgios Georgakis,Jorge Enriquez,Surya Suresh,Marco Dolci,Philip Twu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉的6自由度物体姿态估计算法，专门针对火星样本返回任务中的低功耗硬件约束，使用自定义渲染器和边缘域模板匹配实现鲁棒的姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星样本返回任务中机器人手臂在严重硬件约束下对多个目标物体进行低间隙拾取和插入时的姿态定位问题。

Method: 使用自定义渲染器和专门为边缘域设计的新模板匹配度量，仅需低保真、无纹理的3D模型作为输入。

Result: 在合成数据集、地球物理测试台和火星实地图像上的广泛评估表明，该方法在计算和内存受限的定位任务中，在鲁棒性和准确性方面均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用硬件上的廉价可靠定位开启了新的可能性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

### [13] [LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25528)
*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG是一个结合视觉语言模型和大语言模型的混合管道，用于解决户外驾驶场景中的指称接地问题，在Talk2Car基准测试中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景中的指称接地具有挑战性，因为场景变化大、视觉相似物体多、动态元素复杂，使得解析自然语言指称（如"右边的黑色汽车"）变得困难。

Method: 提出LLM-RG混合管道：使用LLM提取相关对象类型和属性，检测候选区域，用VLM生成丰富的视觉描述符，然后将这些描述符与空间元数据结合成自然语言提示，输入LLM进行链式推理以识别指称对象的边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG相比基于LLM和VLM的基线方法取得了显著提升。消融实验显示添加3D空间线索能进一步提高接地性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，以零样本方式应用的VLM和LLM在鲁棒的户外指称接地中具有互补优势。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [14] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VISOR++方法，通过优化视觉输入实现多模态视觉语言模型的行为控制，无需运行时访问模型内部，适用于开源和闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法存在局限性：系统提示容易被用户指令覆盖，基于激活的转向向量需要入侵式运行时模型访问，无法用于API服务和闭源模型。需要开发跨模型通用的转向方法。

Method: VISOR++通过生成优化的视觉输入来诱导目标激活模式，实现行为转向。可为多个VLM生成单一转向图像，替代运行时转向向量干预。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和IDEFICS2-8B等模型上，VISOR++图像在拒绝、奉承和生存本能三个对齐方向上达到与转向向量相当的性能。对未见模型也能实现行为转向，且在14,000个MMLU评估任务上保持99.9%性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++提供了一种部署无关的行为控制方法，仅通过视觉输入即可实现有效的多模型行为转向，同时保持原有任务性能。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: Vision-Zero是一个无需人工标注的视觉语言模型自改进框架，通过任意图像对生成竞争性视觉游戏，实现模型自主训练和持续性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前强化学习方法依赖人工标注数据集导致训练成本高、限制视觉语言模型实际部署的问题。

Method: 提出战略自玩框架，让模型在'谁是卧底'式游戏中扮演多个角色进行推理；从任意图像生成游戏；引入迭代自玩策略优化算法，结合自玩和可验证奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在推理、图表问答和视觉理解任务上达到最先进性能，超越其他基于标注的方法。

Conclusion: Vision-Zero证明了无需人工标注即可实现视觉语言模型持续自改进的可行性，具有广泛的领域适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net优势的混合方法，用于脉络膜痣的精确分割，在1024*1024眼底图像上达到89.7%的Dice系数和80.01%的IoU，显著优于Attention U-Net。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉络膜痣有转化为黑色素瘤的风险，早期检测对提高生存率至关重要。现有AI诊断方法在眼底图像分割上面临挑战，特别是数据集分辨率低、标注不一致的问题，限制了分割模型的有效性。

Method: 提出混合模型，将数学/聚类分割方法与U-Net的见解相结合，利用两种方法的优势。这种方法减少了大规模训练数据的需求，提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发脉络膜痣诊断决策支持系统奠定了基础，有望通过自动病变标注提高诊断和监测的速度与准确性。

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development

Motivation: 现有的视觉图神经网络(ViGs)在节点-邻居特征聚合方法上存在局限，需要一种能够有效捕捉复杂节点-邻居关系且无需架构特定优化的通用聚合方法。

Method: 提出交叉注意力聚合方法，其中查询投影来自节点，键投影来自其邻居；并构建AttentionViG架构，使用该交叉注意力聚合方案进行非局部消息传递。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K基准测试中达到SOTA性能；在MS COCO 2017的目标检测和实例分割任务，以及ADE20K的语义分割任务中展现出良好的迁移性；在保持效率的同时实现了竞争性精度。

Conclusion: 所提出的交叉注意力聚合方法不仅实现了强大的性能，而且保持了效率，在计算量相当的情况下提供了与先前视觉GNN架构相竞争的精度。

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MetaChest数据集用于医学图像少样本学习，评估了标准迁移学习和ProtoNet扩展方法在少样本多标签分类任务中的表现，发现迁移学习方法优于专门设计的少样本学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析中标注数据稀缺，需要少样本学习方法。但现有研究主要关注标准少样本学习，而医学应用如胸部X光病理分类需要同时学习新类别并利用已知类别知识，这更符合广义少样本分类场景。

Method: 构建了包含479,215张胸部X光的大规模数据集MetaChest，设计了专门用于少样本分类的元集划分和多标签episode生成算法。评估了标准迁移学习方法和ProtoNet扩展方法。

Result: 增加每个episode的类别数量和每个类别的训练样本数量可提高分类性能。迁移学习方法持续优于ProtoNet扩展方法。高分辨率图像提高准确性但增加计算成本，高效模型架构在显著减少资源需求的同时达到可比性能。

Conclusion: 迁移学习方法在医学图像少样本多标签分类中表现优异，无需专门为少样本学习设计。MetaChest数据集为医学少样本学习研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

TL;DR: K-Prism是一个统一的医学图像分割框架，通过整合语义先验、上下文知识和交互反馈三种知识范式，实现了灵活的分割能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型过于碎片化，通常针对特定任务、模态或器官进行训练，与临床实践中专家整合多种知识的灵活方式形成鲜明对比。

Method: 提出双提示表示方法：1-D稀疏提示定义分割内容，2-D密集提示指示关注区域，通过混合专家解码器动态路由，实现三种知识范式的灵活切换和联合训练。

Result: 在18个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，K-Prism在语义分割、上下文分割和交互分割设置下均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: K-Prism成功模拟了临床实践的灵活性，通过统一框架整合多种知识源，为医学图像分割提供了更接近临床专家思维的方法。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视力威胁性眼病造成重大全球健康负担，但由于医疗人员短缺和专业护理受限，及时诊断面临挑战。多模态大语言模型在医学图像解释方面有潜力，但缺乏适合评估生成式模型的综合基准数据集阻碍了其在眼科领域的发展。

Conclusion: 该工作将公开发布数据集、整理流程和排行榜，有望推动眼科AI应用发展，减轻视力威胁性疾病的全球负担。

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

TL;DR: 提出AFGeo，一种无锚框的跨视角物体地理定位方法，通过直接预测边界框的四个方向偏移来消除对预定义锚点的依赖，结合高斯位置编码和跨视角物体关联模块实现高效定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角物体地理定位方法大多基于锚框范式，这种方法受到预定义锚点的固有约束。为了消除这种依赖，需要开发无锚框的定位方法。

Method: AFGeo直接为每个像素预测到真实边界框的四个方向偏移（左、右、上、下），无需预定义锚点。引入高斯位置编码建模查询图像中的点击点不确定性，并设计跨视角物体关联模块来关联不同视角下的同一物体及其周围环境。

Result: 该方法在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时模型轻量且计算高效，参数开销最小。

Conclusion: AFGeo通过无锚框定位范式结合高斯位置编码和跨视角关联模块，有效解决了跨视角物体地理定位问题，在保持轻量化的同时达到了优越性能。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现有跨模态检索模型（如CLIP）在处理融合图像-文本模态的检索键时性能下降，且现有方法需要精心构建新的三元组数据集，无法泛化到未见过的模态组合。

Method: GCL在mini-batch内对所有模态执行对比学习，利用现有图像-文本对数据集学习统一表示空间，无需额外数据集构建。

Conclusion: GCL是一种有效的方法，能够显著提升多模态检索性能，同时避免了繁琐的数据集构建过程，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost

### [26] [DescribeEarth: Describe Anything for Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25654)
*Kaiyu Li,Zixuan Jiang,Xiangyong Cao,Jiayu Wang,Yuchen Xiao,Deyu Meng,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Geo-DLC任务，即遥感图像的对象级细粒度描述，构建了DE-Dataset数据集和DE-Benchmark评估套件，并开发了DescribeEarth多模态大语言模型，在遥感图像描述任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感图像描述研究主要关注图像层面，缺乏对象级的细粒度解释，无法充分利用遥感图像中丰富的语义和结构信息。

Method: 构建DE-Dataset数据集（25个类别，261,806个标注实例）；开发DE-Benchmark基于LLM问答的评估套件；提出DescribeEarth MLLM架构，集成尺度自适应聚焦策略和领域引导融合模块。

Result: DescribeEarth模型在DE-Benchmark上持续优于最先进的通用MLLM，在事实准确性、描述丰富度和语法正确性方面表现优异，特别是在捕捉内在对象特征和周围环境属性方面。

Conclusion: Geo-DLC任务和DescribeEarth模型为遥感图像的细粒度理解提供了有效解决方案，所有数据、代码和权重均已开源。

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO的深度学习模型用于工业制造中的自动缺陷检测，通过ConSinGAN数据增强解决数据不足问题，YOLOv9+ConSinGAN组合在金属板材缺陷检测中表现最佳，准确率达91.3%，检测时间146ms。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中人工缺陷检测耗时耗力的问题，特别是金属板材表面和孔洞缺陷检测的数据不足挑战。

Method: 使用ConSinGAN生成大量金属板材图像数据增强，比较YOLOv3、v4、v7、v9四个版本模型性能，将最佳模型集成到SCADA系统建立自动光学检测系统。

Result: YOLOv9+ConSinGAN组合表现最优，准确率91.3%，检测时间146ms，成功集成到制造硬件和SCADA系统中。

Conclusion: 提出的YOLOv9+ConSinGAN方法有效解决了工业缺陷检测中的数据不足问题，建立的自动光学检测系统具有实际应用价值，并可扩展到其他工业组件检测。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

*Shiyu Wu,Shuyan Li,Jing Li,Jing Liu,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OmniDFA框架，用于AI生成图像的开集少样本源模型识别，同时构建了包含117万张图像的大型数据集OmniFake。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像检测和源模型识别面临生成模型结构多样性的挑战，现有方法容易过拟合特定伪造特征，且缺乏大规模分类数据集。

Method: 提出开集少样本源识别新范式，开发OmniDFA框架，既能评估图像真实性，又能以少样本方式确定合成来源，并构建OmniFake数据集。

Result: OmniDFA在开集识别方面表现出色，在AIGI检测上达到最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为AIGI检测和识别提供了新范式和大规模数据集，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

### [29] [AIMCoT: Active Information-driven Multimodal Chain-of-Thought for Vision-Language Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25699)
*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AIMCoT框架，通过主动信息驱动的多模态思维链方法，解决现有方法依赖不可靠注意力图和被动选择策略的问题，显著提升多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态思维链方法依赖简单的启发式方法构建交错思维链，通常基于注意力图，但实证分析显示这些注意力图不可靠。其被动选择策略和任意触发机制在捕捉模型认知需求方面存在严重不足。

Method: 提出AIMCoT框架，包含三个协同组件：1) 上下文增强注意力图生成(CAG)，缓解文本-视觉粒度不平衡；2) 主动视觉探测(AVP)，基于信息理论主动选择最能帮助回答问题的图像区域；3) 动态注意力转移触发(DAT)，通过监控模型文本到视觉的注意力转移，智能确定插入视觉信息的最佳时机。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试上的广泛实验表明，AIMCoT在不同设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过主动获取信息和动态结构化推理过程，AIMCoT代表了向更鲁棒、有效和类人化多模态推理的关键一步。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

### [30] [How Diffusion Models Memorize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705)
*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型在图像生成中会记忆训练数据，这主要由早期去噪过程中的训练样本高估驱动，导致多样性减少、去噪轨迹坍缩，并加速向记忆图像收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在图像生成方面取得成功，但它们会记忆训练数据，引发严重的隐私和版权问题。现有工作主要关注记忆的表征、检测和缓解，但记忆发生的根本原因仍未解决。

Method: 通过重新审视扩散和去噪过程，分析潜在空间动态，研究扩散模型如何记忆。具体包括分析训练损失、记忆提示对噪声预测的影响，以及中间潜在变量的分解。

Result: 发现记忆不能仅用过拟合解释，因为训练损失在记忆情况下更大；记忆提示将训练图像注入噪声预测，强制潜在轨迹收敛；初始随机性被快速抑制并被记忆内容替代，偏离理论去噪计划与记忆严重程度高度相关。

Conclusion: 早期高估是扩散模型中记忆现象的核心机制，这为理解和缓解记忆问题提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

### [31] [ProbMed: A Probabilistic Framework for Medical Multimodal Binding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25711)
*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Jianzhong You,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProbMED是一个多模态医学视觉语言预训练模型，采用概率对比学习来建模嵌入分布，将四种医学模态（胸片、心电图、超声心动图和临床文本）对齐到统一的概率嵌入空间，在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学视觉语言预训练模型未能直接处理医学信息获取中的多对多映射关系，需要一种能够建模嵌入分布而非确定性估计的模型来更好地整合多样化的医学模态信息。

Method: 使用概率对比学习，通过InfoNCE损失和Hellinger距离整合跨模态分布，引入概率合成采样损失来捕捉模态特定的均值和方差，改善模态内绑定。

Result: 在13个医学数据集上的实验表明，该模型在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务中优于当前医学视觉语言预训练模型，并展示了多模态整合在预后预测中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ProbMED通过概率建模方法有效解决了医学多模态信息的多对多映射问题，显著提升了医学决策支持系统的性能。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

*Xintong Li,Chuhan Wang,Junda Wu,Rohan Surana,Tong Yu,Julian McAuley,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MISP-DPO框架，通过Plackett-Luce模型在视觉语言模型的多模态DPO中引入多个语义多样的负样本，解决了现有方法依赖简单成对比较导致的优化偏差和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅通过基本扰动或相似性检索生成单一负图像，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉。

Method: 在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，使用稀疏自编码器揭示语义偏差为可解释因子，基于重建难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性选择负样本，采用Plackett-Luce目标和重要性采样策略。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试中，MISP-DPO持续优于先前方法，改善了多模态对齐。

Conclusion: 语义感知的多负采样在基于偏好的学习中具有有效性。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注描述符微调或固定采样策略，忽视了训练过程中空间上下文与视觉相似性之间的动态交互作用。

Method: 提出轻量级Soft Probing模块学习补丁描述符的残差权重，构建在线地理-视觉图融合地理邻近度和当前视觉相似性，使用贪心加权团扩展采样器聚焦信息量最大的地点邻域。

Result: 在SPED、Pitts30k-test、MSLS-val和Nordland上分别达到98.9%、95.8%、94.5%和96.0%的Recall@1，在SPED上仅使用4096D全局描述符就获得100%的Recall@10。

Conclusion: SAGE通过空间-视觉自适应图探索，有效提升了视觉地点识别的性能，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and
model will be available at: https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTo是一个基于地标标记化的扩散变换器，用于细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑，通过量化地标坐标、位置映射编码和基于视觉语言模型的地标预测器，解决了现有方法在精确属性控制和身份保持方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的人脸编辑模型在精确属性控制和身份保持方面存在困难，特别是当条件地标与源图像差异较大时（如大表情或姿态变化、不准确的地标估计），会降低身份保持效果。

Method: 提出LaTo方法，包括：(1) 地标标记器将原始地标坐标量化为离散面部标记；(2) 位置映射位置编码整合面部和图像标记；(3) 基于视觉语言模型的地标预测器从指令和源图像推断目标地标。

Result: 在身份保持方面比现有最优方法提升7.8%，在语义一致性方面提升4.6%，并构建了包含15万对真实人脸的大型基准数据集HFL-150K。

Conclusion: LaTo通过创新的地标标记化和统一处理框架，实现了更好的细粒度人脸编辑效果，在身份保持和语义一致性方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景下的视频目标分割任务中表现出色，验证了置信度引导融合策略的有效性。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in
complex scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张RGB图像恢复3D人体网格存在固有的模糊性，现有方法要么回归单一确定性输出，要么在概率方法中面临准确性与样本多样性的权衡，且单预测结果不如最先进的确定性模型。

Method: 使用SO(3)扩散模型生成以3D旋转表示的姿态参数分布，通过条件dropout实现无条件和图像条件生成；利用transformer学习人体关节的层次结构，用小型MLP去噪模型学习基于潜在向量的逐关节分布。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效预测准确的姿态概率分布。

Conclusion: 提出的SO(3)扩散模型方法能够有效建模与2D观测对齐的3D人体姿态分布，解决了现有概率方法的局限性。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

TL;DR: GeoDrag是一种基于几何引导的拖拽式图像编辑方法，通过结合3D几何线索和2D空间先验，解决了传统2D编辑方法在几何密集型场景中的不精确和不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于拖拽的图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，缺乏3D几何线索，导致在旋转和透视变换等几何密集型场景中产生不精确和不一致的编辑结果。

Method: 提出统一的位移场，联合编码3D几何和2D空间先验；采用无冲突分区策略隔离编辑区域，防止干扰并确保一致性。

Result: 在各种编辑场景下的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，显示出优越的精度、结构一致性和可靠的多点编辑能力。

Conclusion: GeoDrag能够实现连贯、高保真和结构一致的图像编辑，代码将在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

TL;DR: 提出IPDRecon方法，通过图像平面解码框架减少对多视角几何约束的依赖，利用单视角内的丰富空间信息实现稳定的室内场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于体素的室内场景重建方法依赖多视角像素反投影射线交点作为弱几何约束，导致重建质量严重依赖输入视角密度，在重叠区域和未观测区域性能较差。

Method: IPDRecon包含三个核心组件：像素级置信度编码器(PCE)、仿射补偿模块(ACM)和图像平面空间解码器(IPSD)，通过物理成像过程解码2D图像中的3D结构信息。

Result: 在ScanNetV2上的实验表明，IPDRecon在视角数量减少40%时仍能保持几乎相同的重建质量，变异系数仅为0.24%，性能保持率达99.7%，最大性能下降仅0.42%。

Conclusion: 利用视角内空间信息为实际应用中的视角受限场景提供了鲁棒解决方案，显著提升了重建稳定性和视角不变性。

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声在医学中至关重要，但面临操作者依赖、图像噪声和实时扫描等挑战，阻碍了AI集成。现有大模型难以处理超声的复杂性。

Method: 构建了200万规模的多模态数据集，采用三阶段训练策略：领域专业化预训练、指令驱动对齐和基于强化的精炼。Dolphin R1通过强化学习增强推理透明度和可解释性。

Result: 在U2-Bench八个超声任务评估中，Dolphin R1获得0.5835的U2分数，是第二名模型（0.2968）的两倍多，创下新纪录。Dolphin v1.0也表现优异。

Conclusion: 推理增强训练显著提高了诊断准确性、一致性和可解释性，对高风险医疗AI至关重要，为超声AI集成提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,
consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes
medical AI.

*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON是一个基于测量引导扩散的虚拟试穿框架，通过线性逆问题重构和轨迹对齐求解器，有效解决非试穿区域的身份背景保持和边界伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法在使用潜在扩散模型时，难以在保持试穿区域对齐的同时，有效保留非试穿区域的身份和背景信息，直接替换策略容易产生边界伪影。

Method: 将虚拟试穿重构为线性逆问题，采用轨迹对齐求解器逐步强制测量一致性；集成基于残差先验的初始化缓解训练-推理不匹配，以及无伪影测量引导采样结合数据一致性、频域校正和周期性标准去噪。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和SHHQ-1.0数据集上的实验表明，ART-VITON能有效保持身份和背景，消除边界伪影，在视觉保真度和鲁棒性上持续优于最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量引导的扩散框架成功解决了虚拟试穿中的非试穿区域保持问题，实现了无伪影的高质量图像生成。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了文本偏好优化(TPO)框架，通过训练模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示，实现无需配对图像偏好数据的文本到图像模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈的强化学习方法依赖昂贵的配对图像偏好数据或学习奖励函数，面临可扩展性限制。

Method: 使用大语言模型扰动原始标题构建不匹配提示，训练模型偏好匹配提示，扩展DPO和KTO算法为TDPO和TKTO。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法持续优于原始对应方法，获得更好的人类偏好分数和文本-图像对齐效果。

Conclusion: TPO框架实现了"免费午餐"对齐，无需配对图像偏好数据即可有效提升文本到图像模型的对齐性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

TL;DR: v-HUB是一个新的视觉中心视频幽默理解基准，包含来自无声电影和在线资源的短视频，用于评估多模态大语言模型仅通过视觉线索理解幽默的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和诊断多模态大语言模型理解幽默的能力，以增强人机交互中的参与度。

Method: 构建v-HUB基准，包含最小化语言内容的短视频，配以丰富的注释（字幕、描述、解释），支持字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务，并创建开放式视频问答任务。

Result: 实验结果显示，所有模型在仅通过视觉线索理解幽默时都面临困难，从基于文本评估转向基于视频评估时性能显著下降。加入音频有助于视频幽默理解。

Conclusion: MLLMs在仅通过视觉线索理解幽默方面存在挑战，音频的加入能提升理解能力，表明整合更丰富的模态对于复杂视频理解任务具有潜力。

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

### [43] [PCPO: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization for Aligning Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25774)
*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了比例信用策略优化（PCPO）框架，通过稳定目标重构和时间步重加权来解决文本到图像模型强化学习训练中的不稳定性问题，显著提升收敛速度和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的策略梯度方法在文本到图像模型对齐中受到训练不稳定性和高方差的困扰，这阻碍了收敛速度并损害了图像质量。分析发现主要原因是生成采样器的数学结构导致跨时间步的反馈波动且不成比例。

Method: 引入比例信用策略优化（PCPO）框架，通过稳定目标重构和原则性的时间步重加权来强制执行比例信用分配，从而纠正训练过程中的不稳定性。

Result: PCPO显著稳定了训练过程，导致收敛速度显著加快和图像质量显著提升。质量提升直接归因于缓解了递归训练中常见的模型崩溃问题。

Conclusion: PCPO在所有方面都大幅优于现有的策略梯度基线方法，包括最先进的DanceGRPO方法。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ENM Inversion的新反演技术，通过搜索最优噪声图来同时保证内容保持和可编辑性，解决了现有方法在文本引导图像编辑中难以紧密遵循目标提示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反演方法在文本引导图像编辑中存在局限性，虽然能忠实重建源图像，但限制了所需编辑的灵活性，难以紧密遵循目标文本提示。

Method: 分析了增强可编辑性的噪声图特性，提出可编辑噪声优化方法，通过最小化重建和编辑后噪声图之间的差异来与期望编辑对齐。

Result: 大量实验表明，ENM Inversion在广泛的图像编辑任务中，在内容保持和编辑保真度方面均优于现有方法，并能轻松应用于视频编辑以实现时间一致性和跨帧内容操作。

Conclusion: ENM Inversion是一种有效的反演技术，能够同时实现高质量的内容保持和编辑保真度，解决了现有方法的局限性，并具有扩展到视频编辑的潜力。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoQuality是一个无需真实标签的自监督框架，通过自我一致性原则和群体相对策略优化，让视觉语言模型自主提升图像质量评估能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的后训练方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，而自监督技术在感知领域如图像质量评估中的应用尚未充分探索

Method: 采用基于排名的自我一致性，通过多数投票生成伪标签，构建保真度奖励，使用群体相对策略优化进行迭代进化

Result: 在多个IQA基准测试中，零样本性能提升31.8%，在7个基准中的5个超越有监督的SOTA模型

Conclusion: EvoQuality证明了完全自监督方法在图像质量评估任务中的有效性，能够达到甚至超越有监督方法的性能

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingECG是一种概率性师生模型，利用不确定性感知的ECG嵌入和ECHO监督来改进基于ECG的心脏功能预测，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下优于现有ECG基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图(ECG)成本低且易于获取，而超声心动图(ECHO)需要大量医院资源但在临床心脏评估中至关重要。研究旨在利用ECG预测传统上需要更复杂模态(如ECHO)获得的关键结果。

Method: 提出EchoingECG概率师生模型，整合概率跨模态嵌入(PCME++)和基于ECHO-文本对预训练的视觉语言模型(ECHO-CLIP)，将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中。

Result: 实验和外部验证表明，EchoingECG在基于ECG的ECHO预测任务中，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下均优于最先进的ECG基础模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过方差估计增强了模型性能理解，识别了ECG中的不确定性区域，为利用ECG作为更易获取的心脏功能预测方法提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要通过基于图像注释的多选题评估VLMs的具身推理能力，缺乏对精确视觉定位的系统评估。

Method: 构建PIO基准，包含三个层次评估阶段：S1参考对象定位、S2任务驱动指向、S3视觉轨迹预测，涵盖室内、厨房、驾驶和机器人操作等关键领域。

Result: 对10多个最先进VLM的广泛实验发现，GPT-4o等通用模型在精确视觉定位上表现不如某些开源模型；MoLMO在S1和S2表现良好但在需要视觉轨迹规划的S3中表现不佳。

Conclusion: PIO基准揭示了当前VLMs在精确视觉定位方面的局限性，为评估和改进具身推理能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DSGA模块结合LoRA，在极少量数据下高效微调SAM模型，用于农业场景中小密集物体的精确分割，仅需4.00M可训练参数，性能显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业计算机视觉任务中，基础模型的参数高效微调面临训练数据有限和复杂田间条件的挑战，需要开发在极端数据约束下仍能保持精确分割性能的方法。

Method: 引入动态相似性图适应(DSGA)模块，通过可学习多项式衰减初始化权重排序机制构建动态相似性图，结合自适应局部特征聚合，并与LoRA集成形成互补优化框架。

Result: 在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上，DSGA+LoRA在2、4、8、10样本设置下均表现优异，结构度量提升17.31%，自适应F度量提升62.36%，在10-120个豆荚的图像上实现准确计数(R²=0.8987)。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化农业监测提供了实用解决方案，在极少量训练数据下实现了精确的物体分割和计数，验证了图基特征适应与LoRA互补优化的有效性。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在领域特定场景（如产品审核）中的应用未被充分探索，传统logo识别方法依赖记忆大量品牌表示，在实际场景中不实用。

Conclusion: Logo-VGR通过领域特定的多模态推理范式，有效解决了logo识别的泛化问题，为产品审核等应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的奖励引导图像编辑框架，将编辑过程建模为轨迹最优控制问题，在扩散模型的反向过程中通过伴随状态迭代更新来引导编辑，在保持源图像语义内容的同时提升目标奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励引导方法主要关注图像生成，但在图像编辑任务中如何保持源图像语义内容同时增强目标奖励的研究较少。

Method: 将图像编辑过程建模为轨迹最优控制问题，将扩散模型的反向过程视为从源图像出发的可控轨迹，通过迭代更新伴随状态来引导编辑过程。

Result: 在多个不同编辑任务上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于反转的无训练引导基线方法，在奖励最大化和源图像保真度之间实现了更好的平衡，且避免了奖励破解问题。

Conclusion: 该框架为无需训练的奖励引导图像编辑提供了一种有效解决方案，能够在不牺牲源图像内容的前提下实现目标奖励的优化。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

TL;DR: 该论文发现多模态推理在增强逻辑推理能力的同时会损害视觉感知基础，提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法来解决视觉遗忘问题，并在VAPO-Thinker-7B模型上取得了SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态推理在视觉任务中展现出潜力，但研究发现它会逐渐损害模型的感知基础能力，导致基本视觉问题识别失败，这种现象被称为视觉遗忘。

Method: 提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法，通过明确引导推理过程朝向视觉基础轨迹，增强模型对视觉信息的依赖。

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B模型显著增强了模型对视觉信息的依赖，在多个基准测试中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: VAPO方法有效解决了多模态推理中的视觉遗忘问题，在保持推理能力的同时增强了视觉感知基础，为多模态模型的发展提供了重要洞见。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态符号逻辑推理在自动驾驶和医疗诊断等高风险应用中至关重要，其严谨的确定性推理有助于防止严重后果。需要评估当前最先进视觉语言模型在这方面的能力。

Method: 构建了MuSLR基准，涵盖7个领域的1,093个实例，包括35个原子符号逻辑和976个逻辑组合，推理深度从2到9。提出了LogiCAM框架，将形式逻辑规则应用于多模态输入。

Result: 评估的7个视觉语言模型在多模态符号推理方面都表现不佳，最佳模型GPT-4.1仅达到46.8%。LogiCAM框架将GPT-4.1的思维链性能提升了14.13%，在复杂逻辑如一阶逻辑上提升更大。错误分析显示约70%的失败源于模态间的逻辑不对齐。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在多模态符号逻辑推理方面存在显著不足，LogiCAM框架通过应用形式逻辑规则有效提升了推理性能。模态间的逻辑不对齐是主要挑战，为未来改进提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All
data and code are publicly available at https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR.

Result: 实验显示在少样本和批量零样本场景下性能优于先前工作，即使不使用文本特征

Conclusion: 统一的纯补丁框架可实现快速、轻量校准的部署，无需精心设计的文本提示

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Motivation: 融合摄像头和LiDAR数据以增强空间理解，特别是在低光条件下保持鲁棒性，解决传统方法在光照不足时的性能下降问题。

Method: 使用初始校准确定相机内参，自动计算LiDAR与相机间的几何变换，无需专用校准目标；在融合前进行色彩校正确保一致性；集成低光图像增强模块。

Result: 使用Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR和四摄像头配置测试，优化软件实现实时性能，在极低光照下仍能可靠着色，成功恢复原本无法检测的场景细节。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、硬件无关的LiDAR点云彩色化解决方案，在低光条件下表现优异，简化了设置流程并实现了实时处理。

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖切片级提示，无法捕捉对癌症诊断至关重要的组织学实体（如细胞核、腺体）的亚型特异性表型变异。

Method: 利用LLM生成实体级和切片级提示；提出实体引导交叉注意力模块生成实体级特征；开发跨尺度实体图学习模块丰富实体表示；结合实体级和切片级输出进行最终预测。

Result: 在三个癌症队列上的结果证实了该方法在解决少样本病理诊断任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MAPLE框架通过整合多尺度视觉语义和在实体级与切片级进行联合预测，有效提升了少样本全切片图像分类的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"图像思维"范式在数据构建准确性、结构设计和应用场景方面仍有很大探索空间，需要推进多模态推理的发展。

Method: 构建包含31k条思维链推理轨迹的数据集，设计直接在视觉嵌入空间生成"视觉思维"的模型，避免调用外部工具和重复编码生成图像。

Result: 在多模态推理基准测试中表现出色，验证了数据集的实用性和模型设计的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepSketcher通过工具无关的视觉嵌入空间操作，为"图像思维"范式提供了更灵活的实现方式，推动了多模态推理的发展。

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text

first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts

Conclusion: MMDS数据集和LLaVAShield为多模态多轮对话安全研究提供了重要基础，将公开发布以支持未来研究。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在高层场景理解表现出色，但在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务上表现不佳，因为语言中心架构难以生成精确数值坐标。

Method: 提出VLM-FO1框架，包含混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和基于token的引用系统，采用两阶段训练策略，可作为即插即用模块与任何预训练VLM集成。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1建立了感知感知VLMs的有效灵活范式，弥合了高层推理与细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了36种先进视觉模型对抗样本的鲁棒性，发现数据量和模型规模遵循对数缩放规律：数据量增加10倍平均降低攻击成功率3.2%，模型规模增加10倍平均降低攻击成功率13.4%。数据质量、架构和训练目标比原始规模对鲁棒性影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络架构和训练范式有所进步，但仍然容易受到对抗样本的攻击。研究旨在探索训练数据特征如何影响视觉模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 评估了36种最先进的视觉模型，涵盖监督学习、自监督学习和对比学习方法，训练数据集规模从120万到220亿张图像。在六种黑盒攻击类别下进行评估：随机扰动、两种几何掩码、COCO对象操作、ImageNet-C损坏和ImageNet-R风格转换。

Result: 鲁棒性随数据量和模型规模呈对数缩放规律：数据量增加10倍平均降低攻击成功率约3.2%，模型规模增加10倍平均降低攻击成功率约13.4%。一些在精选数据集上训练的自监督模型（如DINOv2）表现优于在更大但质量较差数据集上训练的模型。对抗性微调改善了结构变化的泛化能力，但对颜色分布的泛化能力没有改善。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展规模可以提高鲁棒性，但数据质量、架构和训练目标在实现广谱对抗鲁棒性方面比原始规模起着更决定性的作用。人类评估揭示了人类视觉与机器视觉之间存在的持续差距。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Conclusion: UniMMAD成功解决了多模态多类别异常检测中的碎片化问题和跨域变化挑战，提供了一种高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

Conclusion: SS-ACL框架能够生成准确且基于视觉证据的医学报告，在多个下游视觉任务上表现优异，为临床工作流程提供了可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Motivation: 现有计算机视觉方法针对单个福利指标，依赖其他领域的检测器和跟踪器，资源需求高且易受水下场景中鲑鱼遮挡、外观相似和运动相似等挑战影响。

Method: 使用姿态估计网络提取鲑鱼及其身体部位的边界框，通过专门模块利用身体部位信息解决水下鲑鱼跟踪难题，然后利用高细节身体部位轨迹计算福利指标。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业水产养殖网箱中的鲑鱼福利监测提供了一种灵活有效的解决方案，能够应对水下场景的特殊挑战。

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available

Motivation: 现有交互式分割方法局限于粗粒度的实例级目标，而非交互式方法在稀疏真实扫描上表现不佳且缺乏标注数据。

Method: 开发了新的3D数据合成流水线创建大规模场景级数据集，并提出了交互式框架PinPoint3D，通过用户点点击实现细粒度分割。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了在复杂3D环境中实现更细致和精确的机器感知与交互的重要进展。

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VICL方法基于相似性优先假设缺乏充分理论依据，且Partial2Global依赖随机采样导致覆盖不完整和冗余比较，影响全局排序质量。

Method: 使用jackknife conformal prediction构建可靠替代集，结合covering design-based sampling确保成对偏好的全面均匀覆盖。

Result: 在多种视觉任务上的广泛实验表明，RH-Partial2Global表现出色，性能优于Partial2Global。

Conclusion: RH-Partial2Global为VICL提供了可靠且全面的上下文示例选择方法，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑模型因传统注意力机制的二次计算复杂度，难以适应长时长高分辨率视频，限制了实时视频处理等实际应用。

Method: 将线性时空聚合模块集成到基于扩散的视频模型中，利用RWKV变换器的双向加权键值循环机制捕获全局依赖并保持时间一致性。

Result: 相比最先进的基于扩散的视频编辑方法，实现3.7倍加速和60%内存节省，在帧一致性和文本对齐方面保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在长视频编辑中与自注意力架构的速度差距更加显著，为高效视频编辑提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和Ego4D数据集上超越所有基线方法，达到全监督方法50%以上的性能

Conclusion: 证明了利用自然语言叙述作为弱监督进行人手物体分割的可行性，为减少标注成本提供了有效途径

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

TL;DR: 提出了AgenticIQA框架，将视觉语言模型与传统图像质量评估工具动态集成，通过分解任务、规划策略和执行工具来提升评分准确性和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像质量评估方法使用固定模型输出标量分数，难以适应不同失真类型、用户特定查询和可解释性需求，且评分与解释通常独立处理。

Method: AgenticIQA框架将IQA分解为四个子任务：失真检测、失真分析、工具选择和工具执行，由规划器、执行器和总结器协调完成。

Result: 在多个IQA数据集上的实验表明，AgenticIQA在评分准确性和解释对齐方面均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: AgenticIQA通过模块化代理框架有效解决了传统IQA方法的局限性，提供了更准确和可解释的图像质量评估。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用针孔和鱼眼图像的互补特性（无失真vs失真、小FOVvs大FOV、远场vs近场）进行联合优化，解决异构多视角深度估计问题。

Method: 采用统一架构处理异构相机；将2D特征显式提升到规范3D体积空间；设计异构空间融合模块处理失真感知的体积特征；将传统体素融合重新表述为3D高斯表示，使用可学习潜在高斯球动态适应局部图像纹理；最后将融合的体积特征渲染为多视角深度图。

Result: 在KITTI-360和RealHet数据集上超越了当前主流深度网络，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究异构针孔-鱼眼深度估计的工作，既提供了技术新颖性，又提供了有价值的实证见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

Motivation: 传统二阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声时会在去噪早期引入块状伪影，需要开发更有效的去噪方法。

Method: 使用四阶非线性PDE模型，结合拉普拉斯算子和强度值的扩散过程，以及保持细节的波动部分，对灰度图和彩色图分别进行去噪处理。

Result: 在PSNR、MSSIM和SI等指标上均优于现有的二阶各向异性扩散方法，在灰度图和彩色图上都取得了更好的去噪效果。

Conclusion: 提出的四阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声方面优于传统二阶模型，能有效减少伪影并保持图像细节和纹理。

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

TL;DR: SETR提出了一种语义增强的两阶段检索方法，用于零样本组合图像检索。第一阶段通过交集驱动策略过滤无关背景信息，第二阶段使用多模态大语言模型进行细粒度语义相关性判断，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP方法在组合图像检索中的两个核心问题：基于并集的特征融合会携带不相关的背景细节，以及全局余弦相似度无法处理细粒度语义关系。

Method: 两阶段检索方法：粗检索阶段使用交集驱动策略保留参考图像和相对文本的重叠语义；重排序阶段使用LoRA适配的多模态大语言模型进行二元语义相关性判断。

Result: 在CIRR、Fashion-IQ和CIRCO数据集上取得新的最先进性能，在CIRR上的Recall@1提升了15.15个百分点。

Conclusion: 两阶段推理为稳健且可移植的零样本组合图像检索提供了一个通用范式。

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

Motivation: 解决遥感数据与OSM数据之间的模态差异（数据结构、内容和空间粒度不同），使遥感基础模型能够有效整合丰富的地理上下文信息，推进地理空间智能。

Method: 在预训练阶段使用OSM数据提供的多粒度学习信号，通过跨模态空间相关性指导信息交互；引入图像掩码重建实现稀疏输入的高效预训练；在下游任务中生成单模态和多模态细粒度编码。

Conclusion: 多模态协同在推进高级地理空间人工智能方面具有巨大潜力，空间相关性在实现有效多模态地理空间数据整合中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

Conclusion: 分块式视频超分辨率范式具有灵活性，能够高效实现高质量4K视频超分辨率，为视频生成模型在超分辨率任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

### [78] [SeMoBridge: Semantic Modality Bridge for Efficient Few-Shot Adaptation of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26036)
*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，解决了CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在零样本任务中表现良好，但在少样本分类中存在模态内不对齐问题，这是由于模态间隙和仅跨模态训练目标导致的嵌入空间未校准，使图像间直接比较不可靠。

Method: 提出SeMoBridge方法，通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态同时保持语义内容不变。该方法为闭式解，可选择通过多模态监督训练，结合图像和文本对齐损失来优化投影。

Result: 实验表明，训练版本SeMoBridge-T仅需少量训练时间，整体性能优于其他方法，尤其在低数据场景（1、2、4样本）中表现突出。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge有效解决了CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，提供了一种轻量级但强大的解决方案。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Urawee Thani,Ki Fung Wong,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩展HAMMER模型以处理全局场景不一致性（如前景-背景不匹配），通过轻量级分割引导评分管道提升多模态操纵检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER在多模态操纵检测中表现优异，但在处理主要主体被错误放置到不合理背景的全局场景不一致时表现不佳，存在标签空间偏差、局部注意力焦点和虚假文本-前景对齐等问题。

Method: 提出分割引导评分（SGS）管道：使用人物/面部分割掩码分离前景和背景区域，通过联合视觉语言模型提取嵌入，计算区域感知一致性分数，并与HAMMER原始预测融合。

Result: SGS显著增强了HAMMER对全局操纵的鲁棒性，改进了二元检测、定位和标记级解释，且仅需推理阶段，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了区域感知推理在多模态虚假信息检测中的重要性，为处理全局场景不一致性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

### [80] [DGM4+: Dataset Extension for Global Scene Inconsistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26047)
*Gagandeep Singh,Samudi Amarsinghe,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了DGM4数据集，新增了5000个包含前景-背景不匹配及其与文本操作混合的高质量样本，创建了DGM4+基准数据集，用于测试多模态模型对全局不一致性的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGM4数据集仅限于局部操作（如人脸交换、属性编辑和字幕更改），而现实世界伪造中普遍存在全局不一致性（如前景背景不匹配），这构成了关键的研究空白。

Method: 使用OpenAI的gpt-image-1和精心设计的提示生成以人为中心的新闻风格图像，将真实人物置于荒谬或不可能的背景下；字幕在三种条件下生成：字面、文本属性和文本分割，产生三种新的操作类别；实施质量控制管道确保数据质量。

Result: 创建了DGM4+数据集，包含FG-BG、FG-BG+TA和FG-BG+TS三种新的操作类别，为多模态模型提供了测试全局推理能力的基准。

Conclusion: DGM4+数据集通过引入全局操作补充了现有数据集，能够更全面地评估多模态模型对局部和全局不一致性的检测能力，特别是针对HAMMER等模型在前景-背景不一致性方面的弱点。

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at
https://github.com/Gaganx0/DGM4plus

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于主纤维丛截面概念的新方法，用于在分类任务中消除对称性影响，避免数据增强，构建更可持续的算法。该方法通过优化截面来最大化类别分离，并在物体轮廓数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉和医学应用中的数据集通常包含对称性（如旋转、缩放等），传统方法使用数据增强来学习这些对称性，但这种方法不够可持续。本文旨在避免数据增强，构建更可持续的算法来处理对称性问题。

Method: 基于主纤维丛截面概念，通过构建对称群作用下的轨道空间度量来测量对象轨道间的差异。提出了一个包含恒定速度参数化在内的2参数曲线规范参数化族，并优化截面以最大化类别分离。

Result: 在包含平移、旋转、缩放和重参数化对称性的物体轮廓数据集上成功应用了该方法，展示了其有效性。提供了开源代码和教程笔记本供实际应用。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的几何学习框架，避免了传统数据增强方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。几何概念清晰，易于理解，为处理对称性问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用基础模型生成3D伪标签的方法，替代传统计算成本高的自监督学习技术，显著提升语义占据预测性能，并开发了轻量模型EasyOcc。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督学习方法如新视角合成等计算成本和内存使用过高，且难以迁移到其他架构。需要一种更高效、可迁移的解决方案。

Method: 使用Grounded-SAM和Metric3Dv2基础模型生成3D伪标签，利用时序信息进行标签稠密化，可轻松集成到现有模型中。

Result: 在OccNeRF模型上mIoU从9.73提升至14.09（提升45%），EasyOcc模型达到13.86 mIoU，在不使用相机掩码的全场景评估中达到7.71 mIoU，超越之前最佳模型31%。

Conclusion: 基础模型、时序上下文和损失计算空间的选择在自监督学习的全面场景理解中至关重要。

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出一个实时多模态深度学习框架，在足球触球前预测点球方向，准确率达89%，推理时间22毫秒，适用于守门员训练和实时分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点球常决定比赛胜负，但守门员必须在极短时间内从细微的生物力学线索中预判射门方向。

Method: 采用双分支架构：MobileNetV2 CNN处理RGB帧，带注意力机制的LSTM网络处理2D关键点，姿态关键点引导视觉关注任务相关区域，基于距离的阈值方法分割输入序列。

Result: 在755个点球事件数据集上测试，准确率89%，比纯视觉和纯姿态基线提升14-22%，推理时间22毫秒。

Conclusion: 轻量级可解释设计适用于守门员训练、战术分析和实时比赛分析。

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前文本到场景方法在处理复杂几何结构、物体变换和复杂指令遵循方面的局限性。

Method: 使用大型推理模型进行物体检索（涵盖物理、功能和上下文属性），基于隐式和显式布局约束放置物体，并通过碰撞感知的空间推理优化位置。

Result: 在从简单到复杂的室内配置指令评估中，Reason-3D在视觉保真度、约束遵循度和资源检索质量方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推动了文本到场景生成领域的发展，还展示了现代大型推理模型的高级空间推理能力，并发布了代码库以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但存在推理速度慢和训练-推理不一致的问题。现有梯度求解器缺乏信息传输效率的理论基础。

Method: 从信息论角度分析扩散模型推理过程，提出基于条件熵优化的EVODiff方法，通过优化条件方差来最小化转换和重构误差。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上10次函数评估时重构误差降低45.5%，ImageNet-256上高质量样本的函数评估次数减少25%，文本到图像生成质量提升且伪影减少。

Conclusion: 信息论视角为扩散模型推理提供了理论基础，EVODiff方法在生成质量和效率方面显著优于现有最先进的梯度求解器。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen是一个基于视觉自回归模型的零样本主题驱动生成框架，通过双路径注入策略分离主题的语义身份和细节特征，实现了高效高质量的主题驱动生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题驱动生成方法存在效率与质量的两难选择：基于微调的方法计算成本高且缺乏零样本能力，基于扩散模型的方法推理速度慢。视觉自回归模型具有快速采样和强生成质量的特性，但尚未被充分探索用于主题驱动生成。

Method: 提出双路径注入策略：使用语义编码器提取主题的抽象身份，通过解耦交叉注意力注入以指导整体构图；同时使用内容编码器捕捉精细视觉细节，通过多模态注意力机制集成以确保高保真纹理和结构保留。

Result: 定量和定性结果均证实了设计的有效性，EchoGen在主题保真度和图像质量上可与最先进的基于扩散的方法相媲美，同时采样延迟显著降低。

Conclusion: EchoGen是首个基于VAR模型的feed-forward主题驱动框架，成功解决了主题驱动生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，为快速高质量的主题驱动生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EntroPE，一种基于熵的动态补丁编码器，通过信息论标准动态检测时间序列中的自然过渡点来构建补丁边界，解决了传统固定补丁方法破坏时间连贯性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于补丁的时间序列预测方法采用时间无关的补丁构建策略，任意起始位置和固定长度会破坏时间连贯性，分割自然过渡点，干扰短期依赖关系并削弱表示学习。

Method: EntroPE包含两个关键模块：基于熵的动态补丁器(EDP)，使用信息论标准定位自然时间转换点并确定补丁边界；自适应补丁编码器(APE)，使用池化和交叉注意力捕获补丁内依赖关系并生成固定大小的潜在表示。这些嵌入由全局变换器处理以建模补丁间动态。

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中的实验表明，EntroPE在准确性和效率方面都有所提升。

Conclusion: 熵引导的动态补丁方法为时间序列建模提供了一个有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a
scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated,
targeted synthesis, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable

Conclusion: Human-MME基准将单目标理解扩展到多人和多图像的相互理解，为多模态大语言模型在人类中心图像理解方面的研究提供了更好的评估工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，行人检测的安全性和可靠性至关重要，但公平性问题尚未得到充分研究。论文旨在探索行人姿态变化和关节遮挡如何影响检测性能的公平性。

Method: 评估了5个行人专用检测器和3个通用模型在ECP-DP数据集上的表现，使用EOD指标量化公平性，并应用Z检验评估统计显著性和鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现检测器对平行腿、直肘和侧向视角的行人存在偏见，下半身关节遮挡比上半身和头部遮挡对检测率的影响更大。Cascade R-CNN在总体漏检率和所有属性偏差方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对自动驾驶行人检测的全面姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，揭示了现有检测器在公平性方面的重要局限性。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

*Walid Houmaidi,Youssef Sabiri,Fatima Zahra Iguenfer,Amine Abouaomar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriGen是一个用于计算机视觉中自动化、细粒度多属性标注的新框架，特别针对细胞显微镜图像，通过双模型架构实现细胞类型分类和多属性分类，准确率达到94.62%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细胞显微镜领域，多属性分类相比传统的细胞类型分类仍然代表性不足，需要开发自动化方法来提高标注效率和模型可解释性。

Method: 使用两个互补数据集（PBC和WBCAtt），提出双模型架构：CNN用于细胞类型分类，Vision Transformer用于多属性分类。

Result: 实现了94.62%的准确率，显著提高了模型可解释性，相比传统人工标注节省了大量时间和成本。

Conclusion: AttriGen建立了一个可扩展到其他计算机视觉分类任务的新范式，通过有效自动化多属性标签的扩展。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Conclusion: TSalV360方法在360度视频中有效实现了基于文本描述的显著性检测，为个性化视频分析提供了新途径。

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统数据集蒸馏方法使用密集像素表示带来的冗余和可扩展性问题，通过稀疏表示提高存储效率

Method: 使用少量高斯基元编码关键判别信息，采用CUDA-based splatting算子进行并行推理和训练

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet子集上达到最先进性能，同时保持高效的编码解码成本

Conclusion: GSDD是一种简单有效、广泛适用且高度可扩展的数据集蒸馏方法

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

TL;DR: 提出了MGCE框架解决广义类别发现问题，通过多粒度概念专家和动态概念对比学习，能够自动估计未标记数据中的类别数量，在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上取得最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要局限：未能利用视觉数据中的多粒度概念信息，以及假设训练时已知未标记类别数量，这在现实场景中不切实际。

Method: MGCE包含两个模块：动态概念对比学习（DCCL）在概念挖掘和双级表示学习之间交替优化；多粒度专家协作学习（MECL）引入不同粒度的专家并使用概念对齐矩阵进行跨专家协作。

Result: 在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上的实验表明，MGCE取得了最先进的结果，特别是在新类别准确率方面。即使没有类别数量先验知识，MGCE仍优于需要知道确切类别数量的参数化方法，平均提升3.6%。

Conclusion: MGCE通过自适应挖掘视觉概念和集成多粒度知识，有效解决了广义类别发现问题，特别适合实际开放世界场景，能够自动估计类别数量并实现准确分类。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is
available at https://github.com/HaiyangZheng/MGCE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMG是一种无需额外数据或编辑操作的多模态对齐框架，通过MLLM识别错位、隐式对齐器操纵扩散条件特征、以及迭代更新偏好目标来实现图像与提示的精确对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型生成图像与输入提示之间的多模态对齐问题，现有方法要么依赖有限的高质量偏好数据，要么通过编辑局部区域可能损害整体图像质量。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型识别错位，引入隐式对齐器操纵扩散条件特征以减少错位并实现重新生成，将重新对齐目标制定为可训练的目标函数。

Result: 在SDXL、SDXL-DPO和FLUX上的广泛定性和定量评估显示，IMG优于现有的对齐方法，并能作为灵活的即插即用适配器增强先前的基于微调的对齐方法。

Conclusion: IMG提供了一种有效且无需额外数据或编辑操作的多模态对齐解决方案，能够显著提升扩散模型生成图像与输入提示的对齐精度。

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Result: 开发出Donut-MINT模型，在DocVQA基准测试上保持强性能的同时，显著减少了推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法将模型压缩重新定义为电路发现，连接了可解释性研究和实际视觉语言模型部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

Motivation: 现有LAMs存在两个瓶颈：1)端到端训练的视觉编码器空间理解能力差；2)输入帧间隔较大时模型脆弱，时间感知有限。这些问题阻碍了稳定清晰的动作建模。

Method: 提出Farsighted-LAM框架，包含几何感知空间编码和多尺度时间建模，从连续帧中捕获结构先验和动态运动模式。进一步构建SSM-VLA系统，集成结构化感知和视觉思维链模块，显式推理环境动态。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界环境中的多个VLA任务上验证SSM-VLA，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结合几何感知建模、时间一致性和显式推理的策略能有效增强具身智能的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 深度伪造检测面临高质量数据集稀缺的挑战，现有多模态大语言模型在检测时推理与视觉证据不一致，产生幻觉性解释。

Method: 构建推理标注数据集，提出段落级相对策略优化(PRPO)强化学习算法，在段落级别对齐LLM推理与图像内容。

Result: PRPO显著提高了检测准确率，获得了4.55/5.0的最高推理分数，在测试条件下明显优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 将多模态推理基于视觉证据对于实现可靠且可解释的深度伪造检测至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于聚类的仿射变换(CAT)方法，用于改进低比特后训练量化(PTQ)的性能，通过聚类特定参数来对齐量化输出与全精度输出，显著提升低比特量化精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练量化在低比特量化时容易导致精度显著下降，而普通的仿射变换使用统一的参数集会恶化结果，需要更精细的参数调整方法。

Method: 提出聚类仿射变换(CAT)框架，使用聚类特定参数来精化低比特量化输出，仅需少量额外参数，无需微调模型或量化参数。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，该方法在多种架构和低比特设置下均优于现有PTQ方法，W2A2 ResNet-18上达到53.18% Top-1准确率，作为插件可提升现有基线3%以上。

Conclusion: CAT框架有效解决了低比特后训练量化的精度下降问题，提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的参数优化方法。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight

TL;DR: Point2RBox-v3提出了一种基于点标注的弱监督定向目标检测方法，通过渐进式标签分配和先验引导动态掩码损失，解决了现有方法中伪标签利用效率低和质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于点标注的弱监督定向目标检测方法存在两个主要问题：伪标签利用效率低下和伪标签质量较差。作者旨在开发一种更有效的弱监督学习方法，减少对昂贵人工标注的依赖。

Method: 1) 渐进式标签分配(PLA)：在不同训练阶段动态估计实例大小，实现标签分配方法的使用；2) 先验引导动态掩码损失(PGDM-Loss)：改进Point2RBox-v2中的Voronoi分水岭损失，结合SAM模型和分水岭算法的优势。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得优异性能：DOTA-v1.0(66.09%)、DOTA-v1.5(56.86%)、DOTA-v2.0(41.28%)、DIOR(46.40%)、STAR(19.60%)、RSAR(45.96%)，特别在目标尺寸变化大或目标稀疏的场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3是首个使用动态伪标签进行标签分配的模型，创新性地结合了SAM模型和分水岭算法的优势，在稀疏和密集场景中均能取得优异性能。

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along

*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于连续3D视频傅里叶场(VFF)的视频超分辨率方法，能够同时进行空间和时间超分辨率，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视频解耦为空间和时间分量，并依赖脆弱的显式帧扭曲进行运动补偿，存在局限性。需要一种更统一的表示方法来同时捕获空间细节和时间动态。

Method: 将视频编码为连续、时空相干的3D视频傅里叶场(VFF)，使用神经编码器预测傅里叶基系数，支持任意时空位置的灵活采样，并包含高斯点扩散函数以防止混叠。

Result: 在广泛的放大因子范围内，相比现有基线方法，该方法能产生更清晰、时间一致性更好的重建结果，同时计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 提出的联合建模方法显著改善了空间和时间超分辨率性能，在多个基准测试中设定了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

### [105] [SQUARE: Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion and Efficient Batch Reranking for Training-free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26330)
*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE是一个无需训练的两阶段零样本组合图像检索框架，利用多模态大语言模型增强检索性能，通过语义查询增强融合和高效批量重排来更好地捕捉用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本组合图像检索方法虽然无需特定任务训练或标注数据，但准确捕捉用户意图仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）语义查询增强融合阶段，用MLLM生成目标图像描述来丰富CLIP等VLM的查询嵌入；2）高效批量重排阶段，将候选图像以网格形式呈现给MLLM进行联合视觉语义推理。

Result: 在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现出色，即使使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: SQUARE框架简单有效，在零样本组合图像检索任务中展现出强大性能和应用潜力。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

*Keming Wu,Sicong Jiang,Max Ku,Ping Nie,Minghao Liu,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为\mname的奖励模型，用于解决开源图像编辑模型缺乏高质量训练数据的问题。该模型在人类偏好数据集上训练，在多个基准测试中表现优异，并能用于筛选高质量训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源图像编辑模型落后于闭源模型，主要瓶颈是缺乏可靠的奖励模型来扩展高质量合成训练数据。

Method: 构建了\mname奖励模型，使用包含20万对偏好数据的大规模人类偏好数据集进行训练，数据由训练有素的专家按照严格协议标注。

Result: \mname在GenAI-Bench、AURORA-Bench、ImagenHub和\benchname等基准测试中实现了最先进的人类相关性，优于广泛的VLM-as-judge模型。使用\mname筛选ShareGPT-4o-Image数据集后训练的Step1X-Edit模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: \mname能够作为奖励模型扩展高质量图像编辑训练数据，其强对齐性表明在基于强化学习的后训练和图像编辑模型的测试时扩展方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

*Xiangrui Liu,Minghao Qin,Yan Shu,Zhengyang Liang,Yang Tian,Chen Jason Zhang,Bo Zhao,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了任务导向时序定位(ToTG)新问题，并开发了TimeScope框架，通过渐进式推理在长视频中定位关键时刻，在ToTG Bench基准上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在长视频中定位关键时刻时存在泛化能力有限和处理长视频困难的挑战，需要新的解决方案。

Method: TimeScope框架采用渐进式推理：首先在长视频中识别粗粒度的可能包含关键时刻的时间范围，然后通过细粒度时刻划分来精炼这个范围。

Result: 大量实验表明，TimeScope在各种设置下都优于现有的时序定位方法和流行的多模态大语言模型。

Conclusion: TimeScope框架有效解决了任务导向时序定位这一新挑战性问题，展示了渐进式推理方法的优势。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR是首个专为基于下一个token预测的自回归图像生成设计的测试时缩放框架，无需早期解码或辅助奖励，通过token熵和双层级策略提升生成质量并显著减少token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法依赖频繁的部分解码和外部奖励模型，不适用于基于下一个token预测的自回归图像生成，因为中间解码结果不完整。

Method: ScalingAR使用token熵作为视觉token生成的新信号，在配置层级融合内在和条件信号流式传输校准的置信状态，在策略层级利用该状态自适应终止低置信度轨迹并动态调度指导强度。

Result: 在通用和组合基准测试中，ScalingAR将基础模型在GenEval上提升12.5%，在TIIF-Bench上提升15.2%；高效减少62.0%的视觉token消耗；在挑战性场景中将性能下降缓解26.0%。

Conclusion: ScalingAR成功填补了测试时缩放在自回归图像生成中的空白，通过新颖的熵信号和双层级策略显著提升了生成质量、效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出PANDA，一种基于MLLMs的智能AI工程师，用于通用视频异常检测，无需训练数据或人工干预即可处理任何场景和异常类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频异常检测方法依赖特定领域训练数据和人工调整，存在高劳动成本和泛化能力有限的问题，因此需要实现无需训练数据和人工参与的通用异常检测。

Method: 开发了四种关键能力：自适应场景感知策略规划、目标驱动启发式推理、工具增强自我反思和自我改进记忆链。具体包括自适应场景感知RAG机制、潜在异常引导启发式提示策略、渐进式反思机制和记忆链机制。

Result: 大量实验表明，PANDA在多场景、开放集和复杂场景设置中实现了最先进的性能，无需训练和人工参与，验证了其可泛化和鲁棒的异常检测能力。

Conclusion: PANDA成功实现了通用视频异常检测，能够自动处理任何场景和异常类型，为视频异常检测领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionRAG是一个检索增强框架，通过从相关参考视频中提取运动先验来提升图像到视频生成的动态真实感，包含检索管道、上下文学习运动适应和注意力机制运动注入等关键技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像到视频生成在运动真实性方面仍面临挑战，难以准确建模物理约束、物体交互和领域特定动态等复杂运动特征。

Method: 提出MotionRAG框架：1）基于检索的管道使用视频编码器和专用重采样器提取高级运动特征；2）通过因果transformer架构实现上下文学习的运动适应；3）基于注意力的运动注入适配器将转移的运动特征无缝集成到预训练视频扩散模型中。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个领域和各种基础模型上均取得显著改进，推理时计算开销可忽略不计，模块化设计支持通过更新检索数据库实现新领域的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: 该研究通过有效检索和转移运动先验，增强了视频生成系统的核心能力，促进了真实运动动态的合成。

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像难度感知的超分辨率模型评估方法，使用高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数来预测模型在困难图像上的表现差异，弥补传统平均分数评估的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率模型评估使用平均分数，无法反映模型在不同难度图像上的表现差异，特别是某些模型在困难图像上会产生伪影的问题。

Method: 提出了两种图像难度度量指标：高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数，用于预测测试图像中模型视觉效果的显著差异，并设计了相应的评估方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的图像难度度量和评估方法能够有效区分在平均性能接近但视觉结果不同的超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: 基于图像难度感知的评估方法能够更好地反映超分辨率模型在实际应用中的真实性能，特别是在困难图像上的表现差异。

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

TL;DR: 提出PRISM框架，通过三阶段渐进式网络（CENet、SFNet、RNet）结合混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba模块，有效去除图像中的雨纹和水滴，提升图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单尺度模型在图像去雨任务中难以同时实现细粒度恢复和全局一致性，需要更有效的多尺度特征聚合方法。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进框架：CENet进行粗提取，SFNet结合HA-UNet和HDMamba模块进行多尺度特征融合，RNet进行细粒度结构恢复。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了有竞争力的结果，优于最近的去雨方法。

Conclusion: PRISM框架能够有效学习高频雨特征，同时保持结构细节和全局上下文，显著提升图像去雨质量。

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QuaRTZ方法，通过残差截断和零抑制实现扩散模型的4位量化，在保持纹理细节的同时减少计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但计算需求高，部署困难。现有的8位量化方法表现良好，但扩展到4位量化时，由于步长增大导致舍入误差放大，会丢失精细纹理细节。

Method: QuaRTZ方法结合8位最小-最大量化处理异常值，通过前导零抑制压缩到4位以保留最低有效位(LSB)，从而保持纹理细节。该方法平衡异常值保留和LSB精度，减少舍入误差并提高量化效率。

Result: 在FLUX.1-schnell上，4位QuaRTZ实现了6.98的FID分数，优于需要辅助FP16分支的SVDQuant方法。

Conclusion: QuaRTZ通过理论推导和实证评估证明了其在不同激活分布上的通用性，为扩散模型的高效部署提供了有效的4位量化解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

Motivation: 现代生产线确保每辆车符合正确的变体规格且无可见缺陷是一个日益复杂的挑战，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用11个同步摄像头捕获车辆360度视图，通过专用模块（YOLOv8零件检测、EfficientNet ICE/EV分类、Gemini-1.5 Flash OCR、YOLOv8-Seg缺陷分割）处理，结合视图感知融合层和VIN条件规则引擎进行特征验证。

Result: 在混合数据集上达到93%验证准确率、86%缺陷检测召回率，处理速度3.3辆/分钟，显著优于单视图或无分割基线方法。

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos是一个单前向传播的3D高斯框架，用于从单张图像到多视图集合的无姿态3D风格迁移，通过参考风格图像实现几何感知、视图一致的风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D风格迁移方法需要逐场景优化或预计算姿态的问题，实现无需优化、可泛化到未见类别和场景的3D风格迁移。

Method: 采用Transformer骨干网络，包含两条路径：几何预测路径保持自注意力以保留几何保真度，风格注入路径通过全局交叉注意力实现视图间视觉一致性，并引入基于体素的3D风格损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Stylos能够实现高质量的零样本风格化，验证了全局风格-内容耦合、3D风格损失的有效性以及从单视图到大规模多视图设置的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Stylos通过创新的Transformer架构和3D风格损失，实现了无需优化的3D风格迁移，在保持几何完整性的同时确保视图一致的风格化效果。

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

TL;DR: 提出了ASGRA框架，使用场景图和图注意力网络进行室内场景分类和敏感内容分析，无需直接访问敏感图像即可训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景分类在计算机视觉中至关重要，特别是在敏感内容分析如儿童性虐待图像分类方面。传统方法面临物体间复杂关系和空间布局的挑战。

Method: 将图像转换为场景图，然后使用图注意力网络进行推理，直接建模场景组件之间的交互关系。

Result: 在Places8数据集上达到81.27%的平衡准确率，超过基于图像的方法；在真实世界儿童性虐待图像评估中获得74.27%的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 结构化场景表示是室内场景分类和儿童性虐待图像分类的稳健范式，具有内在可解释性和隐私保护优势。

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

TL;DR: 从用户移动轨迹重建空间布局的逆问题，提出使用对比学习嵌入空间的扩散后验采样方法，解决了传统方法中路径规划过程不可微、不稳定等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接从移动轨迹重建空间布局是病态问题，因为多个布局可以解释相同的轨迹。现有生成式逆求解器在路径规划这种不可微、不可逆的前向算子上面临优化不稳定的挑战。

Method: 提出CoGuide方法，通过对比学习训练嵌入空间，使兼容的布局和轨迹在嵌入空间中接近，不匹配的远离。在该嵌入空间中构建替代似然分数来指导扩散去噪过程。

Result: 在广泛实验中，CoGuide从轨迹生成更一致的布局，比可微分规划基线和引导扩散方法更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 通过将似然分数重新表述在更平滑的嵌入空间中，可以有效地引导扩散过程生成与测量一致的后验样本，解决了路径规划前向算子带来的优化挑战。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

Result: 生成的指令调优模型在十亿参数模型中达到最先进性能，在严格硬件约束下表现出强泛化能力，并在多种任务中保持竞争力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEPTHOR++是一个实用的深度补全框架，通过合成数据集训练、无参数异常检测和专门设计的网络架构，显著提升了轻量级dToF传感器在真实场景中的深度增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度增强方法假设理想的dToF输入和完美的dToF-RGB对齐，忽略了校准误差和异常值，限制了实际应用。需要开发对噪声dToF输入更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 1) 基于合成数据集的模拟方法生成真实训练样本；2) 无学习参数异常检测机制识别错误dToF测量；3) 专门设计的深度补全网络，整合RGB图像和单目深度估计先验。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA性能：ZJU-L5上RMSE和Rel分别提升22%和11%；Mirror3D-NYU上镜面区域性能提升37%；Hammer数据集上超越L515测量结果22%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了轻量级dToF传感器在真实场景中的深度感知能力，使低成本传感器能够超越高端设备性能，具有很好的有效性和泛化性。

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型和基准测试未能捕捉专业视频生成的复杂性和需求，需要建立面向专业电影制作的结构化评估框架。

Method: 构建了四个解耦的层次化分类体系，开发自动化提示分类和问题生成流程，进行大规模人类研究（10+模型、20K视频、80+电影专业人士标注），并训练自动评估器。

Result: 即使最强的现有模型在事件和相机相关控制方面仍存在显著差距，训练出的自动评估器在专家标注对齐方面优于现有零样本基线。

Conclusion: SCINE是首个将专业视频生成置于视频生成模型背景下的方法，通过以电影控制为中心的分类体系和结构化评估流程指导未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能够显著降低连接组学中的校对成本，使更大规模和比较连接组学研究变得可行

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

TL;DR: DiffCamera是一个基于扩散变换器的模型，能够根据任意新的焦点和模糊程度对已拍摄图像进行灵活重新对焦，解决了传统景深效果固定难修改的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄影中的景深效果一旦创建就难以修改，当出现对焦错误（如主体失焦）时无法调整。需要一种能够灵活重新对焦已拍摄图像的方法。

Method: 设计了基于扩散变换器的重新对焦学习框架，通过模拟数据生成大规模不同焦点平面和虚化程度的图像对，并引入堆叠约束来增强训练效果。

Result: DiffCamera能够在各种场景下实现稳定的重新对焦，为摄影和生成式AI应用提供了前所未有的景深调整控制能力。

Conclusion: 该模型通过物理基础的堆叠约束实现了精确的景深操作，解决了复杂任务训练中的挑战，为图像后期处理提供了强大的重新对焦工具。

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

Motivation: 现有多模态音频生成模型缺乏精确的用户控制，无法优先处理特定对象或避免不必要的背景声音，限制了在专业Foley工作流程中的应用

Method: 引入视频对象分割感知音频生成任务，使用视觉分割掩码结合视频和文本线索，开发SAGANet多模态生成模型

Result: 相比现有最先进方法有显著改进，为可控、高保真Foley合成设立了新标准

Conclusion: SAGANet通过对象级分割实现了细粒度的音频生成控制，并发布了Segmented Music Solos数据集支持进一步研究

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Conclusion: 降维不仅是预处理步骤，更是提升特征质量和分类性能的关键组成部分。

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

Conclusion: DA²通过大规模数据增强和专门的SphereViT架构，成功解决了全景深度估计中的数据稀缺和球面失真问题，实现了优异的零样本泛化性能和效率。

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

TL;DR: HART是一个统一的稀疏视角人体重建框架，输入少量未标定RGB图像，输出水密着装网格、对齐的SMPL-X人体网格和高斯泼溅表示，用于照片级新视角渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么优化参数化模板（忽略宽松衣物和人物交互），要么在简化相机假设下训练隐式函数（限制真实场景应用）。HART旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 预测逐像素3D点图、法线和身体对应关系，采用遮挡感知泊松重建恢复完整几何，与SMPL-X身体模型对齐，并用人体对齐网格初始化高斯泼溅。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得SOTA：着装网格重建的Chamfer距离提升18-23%，SMPL-X估计的PA-V2V降低6-27%，新视角合成的LPIPS减少15-27%。

Conclusion: 前馈transformer可作为可扩展模型，在真实世界环境中实现鲁棒的人体重建。

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了第一个SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，通过架构设计实现姿态和尺度不变性，在去偏评估协议下显著优于现有方法，并在跨域真实数据上创下新记录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D形状补全方法假设扫描数据已预对齐到规范坐标系，这会导致网络利用姿态和尺度线索记忆绝对位置而非推断内在几何。当真实数据缺乏这种对齐时，性能会崩溃。

Method: 引入SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，其模块化层依次规范化特征、在相似性不变几何上推理，并恢复原始坐标系。采用去偏评估协议消除隐藏线索。

Result: 在PCN基准测试中优于等变和数据增强基线方法；在KITTI上最小匹配距离降低17%，在OmniObject3D上Chamfer距离降低14%；在更严格协议下仍优于竞争方法在其偏置设置下的表现。

Conclusion: 完全SIM(3)等变性是实现真正可泛化形状补全的有效途径。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

Result: 实验表明当前最先进的学术SLAM系统无法应对这些挑战，并识别了导致性能下降的关键组件。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试为评估SLAM系统在真实世界挑战性场景下的性能提供了重要工具，有助于推动相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Query-Kontext方法，通过多模态"kontext"连接VLM和扩散模型，将多模态生成推理能力委托给VLM，同时保留扩散模型的高质量视觉合成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型中，多模态生成推理能力与高保真合成内在纠缠，需要解耦这两个关键能力。

Method: 使用多模态kontext（语义线索和粗粒度图像条件）连接VLM和扩散模型，采用三阶段渐进训练策略：1) 连接VLM与轻量扩散头；2) 扩展到预训练扩散模型；3) 引入低级图像编码器进行指令调优。

Result: 实验表明该方法与强统一基线相当，在某些情况下甚至优于任务特定的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Query-Kontext成功解耦了多模态生成推理和高质量视觉合成，在多种多模态参考到图像场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stitch是一种无需训练的方法，通过自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制集成到多模态扩散变换器中，解决了文本到图像生成中空间关系准确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成模型在空间关系（如"上方"或"右侧"）的准确捕捉方面存在持续挑战，早期方法使用外部位置控制但与现代模型不兼容。

Method: 通过自动生成的边界框，在指定边界框内生成单个对象并无缝拼接，利用目标注意力头在生成过程中隔离和裁剪单个对象。

Result: 在PosEval基准测试中，Stitch显著提升了基础模型性能，将FLUX在GenEval位置任务上提升了218%，在PosEval上提升了206%，并在Qwen-Image上实现了54%的改进。

Conclusion: Stitch无需训练即可将位置控制集成到领先模型中，实现了最先进的结果，同时保持空间准确性和视觉吸引力。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代循环神经网络在3D重建中表现出色，但超出训练上下文长度时性能显著下降，存在长度泛化有限的问题。

Method: 从测试时训练角度重新审视3D重建基础模型，将其设计视为在线学习问题。利用记忆状态与观测的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率来平衡历史信息保留与新观测适应。

Result: TTT3R显著改善了长度泛化，在全局姿态估计上比基线提升2倍，同时以20 FPS处理数千张图像，仅需6GB GPU内存。

Conclusion: 基于测试时训练的TTT3R方法有效解决了3D重建中循环神经网络的长度泛化问题，无需额外训练即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

Conclusion: SOLD模型提供了一种比现有3D方法更简单高效的分子生成方法，在药物设计领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has made a significant impact on de novo drug
design. However, current approaches to creating novel molecules conditioned on
a target protein typically rely on generating molecules directly in the 3D
conformational space, which are often slow and overly complex. In this work, we
propose SOLD (SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion), a novel latent
diffusion model that generates molecules in a latent space derived from 1D
SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses
when training multi-task machine learning models.Our model generates
high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,
while also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more
data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs在纯文本训练中意外地发展出丰富的视觉先验知识，这些先验由可分离的感知和推理先验组成，具有不同的扩展趋势和来源。推理先验主要来自代码、数学等推理中心数据，而感知先验则来自广泛语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在纯文本训练中如何发展出视觉能力，理解视觉先验的组成和来源，为下一代多模态LLMs提供数据中心的预训练方法。

Method: 通过100多个对照实验（消耗50万GPU小时），涵盖从LLM预训练到视觉对齐和监管多模态微调的完整MLLM构建流程，分析不同数据类别和混合对视觉先验的影响。

Result: 发现推理先验主要来自推理中心数据且可转移，感知先验更依赖视觉编码器和视觉指令调优数据，视觉世界描述文本虽重要但性能影响快速饱和。

Conclusion: 提供了一种从语言预训练中刻意培养视觉先验的新方法，为下一代多模态LLMs铺平道路，并提出了多级存在基准（MLE-Bench）。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉和语言的多模态拼图求解框架，通过视觉-语言层次语义对齐模块提升拼图组装性能，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拼图求解方法主要关注视觉线索，但在具有侵蚀间隙的挑战性场景中缺乏语义指导。本文探索利用自然语言描述为拼图组装提供语义引导。

Method: 提出视觉-语言层次语义对齐(VLHSA)模块，通过从局部标记到全局上下文的多层次语义匹配，将视觉补丁与文本描述对齐。采用结合双视觉编码器和语言特征的多模态架构进行跨模态推理。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于最先进模型，实现了包括14.2个百分点碎片准确率提升在内的实质性改进。消融研究证实VLHSA模块在超越纯视觉方法中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 通过整合多模态语义洞察，为拼图求解建立了新范式，证明了语言上下文在增强拼图组装性能中的重要性。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in
piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module
in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic
insights.

*Jin Li,Zhebo Wang,Tianliang Lu,Mohan Li,Wenpeng Xing,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS)，一种轻量级推理时优化方法，通过谱分析和熵属性动态调整token分布，无需更新模型参数即可提高LLM可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于熵的推理方法存在计算开销大、未能有效利用历史token上下文的问题，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: SLS维护top-K logits滑动缓冲区，进行实时奇异值分解识别主导谱方向，基于熵和logit间隙统计自适应重新缩放logits，仅在高不确定性时激活。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，SLS持续优于现有基线方法，在数学、编程和科学推理任务中实现更优准确率。

Conclusion: SLS是一种有效的轻量级推理时优化方法，能够在不更新模型参数的情况下提高LLM输出质量。

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法如GRACE依赖于非多项式运算，与同态加密等隐私保护技术不兼容，限制了隐私保护图表示学习的实际应用。

Method: 开发了全多项式友好的图卷积网络编码器和基于多项式的对比损失函数，使整个框架与同态加密兼容。

Result: 在Cora、CiteSeer和PubMed三个基准数据集上的实验表明，Poly-GRACE不仅支持隐私预训练，而且在性能上与标准非隐私基线相当，在CiteSeer上甚至更优。

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现实用且高性能的隐私保护图表示学习迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

Result: 在特定数据集上，使用双曲优化方法的扩散模型实现了更快的收敛速度，同时保持了生成质量。

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法在双曲流形上有效，能够加速训练收敛，特别是在早期阶段，且不牺牲模型性能。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPSformer是一个针对强降雨预测的长尾学习模型，通过高分辨率分支增强对罕见强降雨事件的表征能力，显著提升了强降雨预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强降雨预测对社会至关重要，但降雨数据分布高度不平衡——大多数观测记录无雨或小雨，而强降雨事件罕见。这种不平衡分布阻碍了深度学习模型有效预测强降雨事件。

Method: 将降雨预测明确视为长尾学习问题，提出DPSformer模型，通过高分辨率分支丰富强降雨事件的表征。

Result: 对于≥50mm/6h的强降雨事件，DPSformer将基线数值天气预报模型的CSI从0.012提升到0.067；对于前1%的强降雨事件，其FSS超过0.45，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为强降雨预测建立了有效的长尾范式，为增强早期预警系统和减轻极端天气事件的社会影响提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning
systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

TL;DR: STCast是一个AI驱动的时空天气预测框架，通过自适应区域边界优化和动态月度预测分配，在全局和区域预测、极端事件预测及集合预测任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区域预测方法受限于静态和不精确的区域边界，导致泛化能力差。需要解决边界约束问题以提升区域天气预报的准确性。

Method: 提出STCast框架：1）空间对齐注意力机制(SAA)对齐全局和区域空间分布来初始化边界，并基于注意力模式自适应优化边界；2）时序专家混合模块(TMoE)使用离散高斯分布将不同月份的大气变量动态路由到专门专家，增强时序模式捕捉能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，STCast在全局预测、区域预测、极端事件预测和集合预测四个任务中均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: STCast通过自适应边界优化和动态专家分配，有效提升了天气预测的准确性和泛化能力，在多个预测任务中表现优异。

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经VWAP执行策略主要针对固定时长订单，无法处理执行时长在最小和最大时间边界之间变化的场景，类似于股票回购合同结构。

Method: 使用TKANs、VSNs和多头注意力机制构建通用特征提取管道处理市场数据，独立的分配网络处理不同场景的特定执行逻辑，实现市场理解共享。

Result: 在日内加密货币市场和多日股票交易（道琼斯成分股）上的实证评估显示，LEMs在灵活时间约束下动态优化执行路径，相比传统基准获得更优的执行性能。

Conclusion: LEMs的统一模型架构能够通过单一框架部署到不同执行场景，相比资产特定方法具有显著操作优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

### [145] [On-the-Fly Adaptation to Quantization: Configuration-Aware LoRA for Efficient Fine-Tuning of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25214)
*Rongguang Ye,Ming Tang,Edith C. H. Ngai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoA-LoRA是一种动态调整LoRA适配器以适应任意量化配置的方法，无需重复微调，通过配置感知模型实现，在边缘设备上实现高效模型压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大模型在边缘设备上的部署需求增加，需要有效的压缩方法。现有方法需要为每个量化配置单独微调LoRA适配器，这在异构边缘设备上计算成本过高。

Method: 提出配置感知模型，将每个量化配置映射到其低秩调整；设计基于Pareto的配置搜索方法，迭代优化训练配置集以获得更精确的低秩调整。

Result: 实验表明，CoA-LoRA无需额外时间成本，就能达到甚至超过需要为每个配置单独微调的最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: CoA-LoRA提供了一种高效的方法，在边缘设备上动态适应不同量化配置，解决了现有方法计算成本高的问题。

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PARADISE的无监督分区异常检测方法，用于多元时间序列异常检测。该方法通过变量聚类保持变量间关系，在子集上执行局部异常检测，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多元时间序列异常检测方法在处理高维数据时面临挑战，需要一种能够保持变量间关系并提高检测性能的新方法。

Method: 通过变量间多重相关系数聚类来划分时间序列变量，确保变量间关系不受影响，然后在每个变量子集上局部执行异常检测算法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的多次实验表明，该方法显著提高了异常检测性能。

Conclusion: PARADISE方法通过变量分区和局部异常检测，在保持变量间关系的同时有效提升了多元时间序列异常检测的效果。

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过生物分类任务重新审视双下降现象，发现只有当模型复杂度在多个维度上同时扩展时才会出现双下降，而固定任一维度时泛化行为会回归经典模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来在深度学习中发现的双下降现象也在简单模型中被报道，但作者认为这些研究可能混淆了模型复杂度的不同维度。本文旨在通过系统实验澄清双下降现象的本质。

Method: 使用结核病异烟肼耐药性预测任务，系统变化模型复杂度在两个正交维度上：学习器容量和集成规模，并在合成基准上复现结果。

Result: 只有当复杂度在两个维度上联合扩展时才会出现双下降现象；固定任一维度时，泛化行为回归经典的U形或L形模式。

Conclusion: 双下降现象源于将不同的泛化机制投影到单一复杂度轴上，强调在分析泛化行为时应将模型复杂度视为多维结构。

Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped
relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a
transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as
complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

TL;DR: L2C是一个可扩展的数据驱动框架，通过训练神经网络来评分变量赋值，加速概率图模型中最可能解释(MPE)推理，显著减少搜索空间并保持或改进解的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率图模型中的MPE推理是一个根本性难解问题，需要开发可扩展的加速方法。

Method: 训练神经网络基于观察证据评分变量赋值的效用，使用从现有MPE求解器搜索轨迹中提取训练信号的可扩展数据生成管道。

Result: 在涉及高树宽PGM的挑战性MPE查询中，学习到的启发式方法显著减少搜索空间，同时保持或改进最先进方法的解质量。

Conclusion: L2C框架成功加速了MPE推理，证明了数据驱动方法在解决难解推理问题中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在TinyML系统中使用动态集成选择(DES)聚类方法进行多类计算机视觉任务，通过调整分类精度来平衡推理时间和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TinyML技术在计算、内存和能源方面的特定约束需要专门的优化技术，而动态集成选择方法在这种平台上具有潜在优势。

Method: 开发了TinyDES-Clustering库，采用动态集成选择聚类方法，针对嵌入式系统限制进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，更大的分类器池能提高分类精度，但会导致TinyML设备上平均推理时间的增加。

Conclusion: DES-Clustering方法能够在TinyML系统中有效平衡分类精度与推理性能，但需要在准确性和效率之间进行权衡。

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

*Xunhao Lai,Jialiang Kang,Jianqiao Lu,Tong Lin,Pengyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Residual Linear Attention (RLA)框架，通过显式残差拟合机制增强线性注意力的表达能力，解决了传统线性注意力在捕捉长程模式时的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意力虽然提供线性时间复杂度的替代方案，但在捕捉长程模式方面表现不佳。现有变体通常采用历史预测加单令牌校正的组合方式，这造成了表达能力瓶颈。

Method: 引入RLA框架，通过维护辅助循环状态来累积残差误差并校正基础预测。具体实例化为Residual Delta Net (RDN)，结合自适应门控和残差裁剪来增强校正控制和稳定性。

Result: 在语言建模和召回密集型评估中，RLA和RDN持续优于各自基线和其他现代线性注意力方法，缩小了与标准Transformer的差距，同时保持线性扩展性。

Conclusion: RLA框架通过残差拟合机制有效提升了线性注意力的表达能力，在保持线性时间复杂度的同时显著改善了长程模式捕捉能力。

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

TL;DR: Ascend MLA (AMLA) 是针对华为昇腾NPU优化的高性能内核，通过FlashAttention算法和预加载流水线策略，显著提升MLA在解码阶段的性能，达到614 TFLOPS和86.8%的理论峰值利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头部潜在注意力(MLA)虽然显著减少了大型语言模型中的KVCache内存使用，但引入了大量计算开销和中间变量扩展，这对解码阶段的高效硬件实现提出了挑战。

Method: AMLA基于两个核心创新：(1) 新颖的FlashAttention算法，用整数加法替代浮点乘法进行输出块重缩放；(2) 预加载流水线策略与分层分块，最大化FLOPS利用率。

Result: 在昇腾910 NPU上，AMLA达到614 TFLOPS，达到理论最大FLOPS的86.8%，优于开源FlashMLA实现（在NVIDIA H800上最高66.7%利用率）。

Conclusion: AMLA内核已集成到华为CANN中，即将发布，为MLA在昇腾NPU上的高效实现提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into
Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

Conclusion: 该贝叶斯优化的MVMD-LSTM框架能够有效解决集成风-光-波海洋能源系统的超短期预测问题，为海上清洁电力供应提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

Conclusion: RPFs提供了一个原则性的、高效的可逆归一化流框架，具有闭式黎曼体积修正项，是生成建模的有力工具。

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of

distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying
data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of
this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation

Conclusion: WDformer通过小波变换和差分注意力机制，有效解决了时间序列预测中的多域信息利用和噪声抑制问题，展现出优异的预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological
rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results
demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

*Kasun Eranda Wijethilake,Adnan Mahmood,Quan Z. Sheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedCLF是一种针对车联网中联邦学习的新方法，通过校准损失和反馈控制机制解决数据异构性和资源受限问题，在高度异构数据场景下比基线模型性能提升高达16%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车联网环境下的联邦学习面临数据异构性和设备异构性的严重挑战，传统方法难以在保持隐私的同时实现高效训练。

Method: 提出FedCLF方法，在参与者选择过程中引入校准损失作为效用指标，并使用反馈控制机制动态调整客户端采样频率。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，FedCLF在高度数据异构场景下相比FedAvg、Newt和Oort等基线模型性能提升高达16%，同时通过减少采样频率提高了效率。

Conclusion: FedCLF通过校准损失和反馈控制机制有效解决了车联网中联邦学习的数据异构性和资源优化问题，显著提升了模型精度和训练效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Motivation: 佳能生产打印的打印头故障识别对产品质量至关重要，喷嘴状态记录可形成特定的时间和空间故障模式。

Method: 采用基于特征的时间序列分类框架，结合领域专家指导选择时间和空间特征，评估多种传统ML分类器，最终选择One-vs-Rest随机森林。

Result: 提出的模型在多个故障机制的加权F1分数上优于内部基于规则的基准方法。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能有效分类打印头故障机制，为产品质量控制提供可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

TL;DR: PALADIN是一个训练语言代理具备故障恢复能力的框架，通过系统性的故障注入和专家演示，使代理能够在工具故障时进行有效恢复，显著提升恢复率和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言代理训练只关注成功轨迹，无法应对现实世界中常见的工具故障（如超时、API异常等），导致级联推理错误和任务失败。

Method: 通过LoRA微调在50,000+条故障恢复轨迹上训练，构建包含55+故障示例的知识库，在推理时检测错误并检索相似案例执行恢复操作。

Result: 在PaladinEval和ToolReflectEval评估中，恢复率从32.76%提升至89.68%，比最强基线CRITIC高13.3%，在未见工具API上保持95.2%的恢复性能。

Conclusion: PALADIN是构建容错代理的有效方法，能够在真实工具环境中实现稳健的故障恢复。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于难度的课程强化学习方法容易陷入局部最优，早期持续训练简单样本会导致策略失去探索能力。

Method: 提出HAMMER框架，将数据集评估中常用的多样性指标转移到动态强化学习过程中，通过最小语义哈密顿路径对训练样本进行排序。

Result: 经验评估表明HAMMER能够激发模型"好奇心"，在多样化推理基准测试中平均准确率提升3%到4%。

Conclusion: 从泛化界限的理论视角看，多样性驱动的排序有助于稳定收敛，HAMMER方法在课程强化学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在编程和数学解题等任务上表现出色，但在需要专业知识的专门领域（如网络安全）的零样本性能往往不理想，因为基础模型是为通用应用设计的。

Method: 研究监督微调(SFT)、低秩自适应(LoRA)和量化低秩自适应(QLoRA)三种微调方法，使用网络安全问答数据集进行实验。

Result: 这些微调方法在网络安全问答任务中显著优于基础模型。LoRA和QLoRA在计算成本大幅降低的情况下，达到了与SFT相当的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

Motivation: 传统特征蒸馏方法（如投影均方损失或CKA）无法有效捕捉教师模型的特征结构，即使损失为零时也是如此，这限制了学生模型的学习效果。

Method: 提出使用Procrustes距离和特征Gram矩阵的Frobenius范数作为蒸馏损失函数，这些距离在表示对齐测量中已有应用。

Result: 在BERT和OPT语言模型家族的分类和指令跟随任务中，新方法比现有方法提升了高达2个百分点的蒸馏性能，具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 将特征几何结构整合到现有蒸馏方法中具有巨大潜力，新方法能够更有效地传递教师模型的特征空间结构。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有气象时间序列预测基准主要评估温度、湿度等周期性强的变量，无法反映降雨临近预报这种更复杂实际场景的需求。降雨预报具有零膨胀、时间衰减和非平稳性等挑战性特征。

Method: 构建RainfallBench数据集，包含6个关键变量和PWV数据；设计专门的评估策略；提出BFPF模块，这是一个即插即用的组件，融入领域先验知识来增强降雨时间序列预测。

Conclusion: RainfallBench填补了降雨临近预报基准的空白，BFPF模块有效解决了现有模型忽视的零膨胀和时间衰减问题，为复杂气象场景的预测提供了更好的评估框架。

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 现有静态提示策略（如Zero-Shot、Few-Shot、CoT）存在效率-准确率的刚性权衡，准确率高的方法（如SC）在简单任务上计算浪费严重，而轻量方法在复杂输入上表现不佳。

Method: 将自适应策略选择形式化为单步马尔可夫决策过程，使用PPO训练Prompt Policy Network，通过资源显式奖励函数学习在必要时才分配昂贵推理策略。

Result: 在算术推理基准测试中，PPN在效率-准确率帕累托前沿上表现优异，相比Self-Consistency可减少61.5%的token成本，同时保持有竞争力的准确率。

Conclusion: PPN为成本高效的LLM部署提供了一个系统化的自适应框架，推动了轻量级优化技术的发展，支持可扩展和可持续的语言模型应用。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small

Motivation: 现有方法难以有效捕捉多模态间的完整协同信息，而协同信息是多模态表示的核心价值。

Method: InfMasking使用无限掩码策略，在融合过程中随机遮蔽大部分模态特征，仅保留部分信息以创建多样化的协同模式，并通过互信息最大化对齐掩码前后的表示。

Result: 在受控实验中验证了InfMasking能有效增强模态间协同信息，在七个大规模真实数据集基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: InfMasking通过无限掩码策略成功解决了多模态协同信息提取的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAESTRO是一个新颖的多模态学习框架，解决了现有方法依赖单一主要模态对齐、成对建模和完整模态观测假设的局限性，通过动态跨模态交互和稀疏专家混合机制，在完整和部分观测下都实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习方法在现实世界多模态时间序列设置中存在三个主要限制：(1)依赖单一主要模态进行对齐，(2)对模态进行成对建模，(3)假设模态观测完整。这些限制阻碍了在传感器故障导致任意缺失观测的实际场景中的应用。

Method: MAESTRO框架通过符号标记化和自适应注意力预算构建长多模态序列，使用稀疏跨模态注意力处理，并通过稀疏专家混合(MoE)机制在不同模态组合下实现黑盒专业化。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上评估，MAESTRO在完整观测下比最佳多模态和多变量方法分别平均提升4%和8%；在部分观测(高达40%缺失模态)下平均提升9%。

Conclusion: MAESTRO的稀疏、模态感知设计在动态时间序列学习中展现出鲁棒性和效率，为现实世界多模态时间序列分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation

Method: 构建包含34,000个合成数据集的综合数据仓库，使用10种流行聚类算法处理，通过调整兰德指数评估聚类结果建立真实标签。网络架构集成卷积、残差和注意力机制，捕捉输入数据的局部和全局结构模式。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，模型始终优于传统聚类有效性指标（如Silhouette、Calinski-Harabasz等）和最先进的AutoML聚类推荐方法（如ML2DAC、AutoCluster等）。在合成数据上比Calinski-Harabasz指数提高0.497 ARI，在真实数据上比最佳AutoML方法提高15.3% ARI。

Conclusion: ClustRecNet通过深度学习有效解决了聚类算法选择问题，减少了对手工元特征和传统聚类有效性指标的依赖，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了LLM在强化学习后训练中的缩放规律，发现在固定计算预算下，大模型少步训练优于小模型多步训练；大模型具有更好的样本效率；数据受限时重复使用高质量数据有效；这些规律在不同类型模型中均稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型预训练阶段的缩放规律已被广泛研究，但强化学习后训练阶段的缩放行为仍缺乏系统性探索，特别是在数学推理任务上。

Method: 基于54个实验，系统分析模型规模、数据量和计算预算在RL后训练中的交互作用，重点关注数学推理任务。

Result: 发现四个关键规律：1) 固定计算预算下大模型少步训练更优；2) 固定数据量下大模型样本效率更高；3) 数据受限时重复使用高质量数据有效；4) 这些规律在不同类型模型中稳健。

Conclusion: 研究结果为通过RL后训练高效扩展LLM推理能力提供了理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LEO-CVAE方法，通过局部熵引导的生成式过采样解决类别不平衡问题，特别关注边界区域的不确定性样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统过采样方法如SMOTE依赖局部线性插值，生成不合理的合成样本；而标准CVAE对所有少数类样本一视同仁，忽略了边界区域重要样本。

Method: 使用局部熵量化不确定性，通过局部熵加权损失和熵引导采样策略，在表示学习和数据生成中显式融入局部不确定性。

Result: 在临床基因组数据集上，LEO-CVAE持续提升分类器性能，优于传统过采样和生成式基线方法。

Conclusion: 在复杂非线性结构主导的领域如组学数据中，不确定性感知的生成式过采样对不平衡学习具有重要价值。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

TL;DR: 论文研究了矩阵分解中梯度下降在大步长下的行为，发现参数空间会形成分形结构，并推导了标量-向量分解的临界步长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索梯度下降在矩阵分解问题中的动力学行为，特别是在大步长情况下参数空间的结构变化和收敛特性。

Method: 通过理论分析推导标量-向量分解的临界步长，研究正则化对收敛边界的影响，并将分析扩展到一般矩阵分解的正交初始化情况。

Result: 发现临界步长附近选择的最小化器对初始化高度敏感，正则化会放大这种敏感性并产生分形边界。在近临界步长下梯度下降进入混沌状态，长期动态不可预测且没有简单的隐式偏好。

Conclusion: 近临界步长会诱导梯度下降进入混沌状态，使得长期动态不可预测，且不存在平衡性、最小范数或平坦性等简单隐式偏好。

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

Motivation: 研究主动相关聚类问题，其中成对相似性不是预先提供的，需要通过主动学习以成本效益的方式查询。特别关注冷启动场景，即没有真实初始成对相似性可用于主动学习的情况。

Method: 提出了一种覆盖感知方法，在过程早期鼓励多样性，以解决冷启动挑战。

Result: 通过多个合成和真实世界实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 覆盖感知方法在冷启动主动相关聚类中表现有效，能够通过早期多样性策略解决初始数据缺乏的问题。

Abstract: We study active correlation clustering where pairwise similarities are not
provided upfront and must be queried in a cost-efficient manner through active
learning. Specifically, we focus on the cold-start scenario, where no true
initial pairwise similarities are available for active learning. To address
this challenge, we propose a coverage-aware method that encourages diversity
early in the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through
several synthetic and real-world experiments.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的蛋白质生成方法缺乏物理真实性，噪声过程没有物理原理基础，需要开发更符合物理规律的蛋白质生成方法。

Method: 引入物理启发的非线性噪声过程，将蛋白质展开为二级结构，同时保持拓扑完整性；结合SE(3)流匹配范式，建模蛋白质骨架的不变分布，并整合序列信息实现序列条件折叠。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理启发的噪声过程和流匹配技术，显著提升了蛋白质生成的真实性和准确性，为蛋白质设计提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据课程对LLM训练至关重要，但最优数据放置原则仍不明确，需要一种方法来评估和预测数据在训练过程中的效果。

Method: 引入TREC诊断方法，分析不同规模模型(111M到3.9B参数)的训练数据保留情况，并利用AdamW的隐式EMA系数预测TREC。

Result: 发现将高质量数据放置在TREC低点能显著提升性能，成功预测了已发布训练方案中的TREC，并改进了3.9B参数LLM在900B tokens上的持续预训练。

Conclusion: TREC为数据课程设计提供了理论基础和实用工具，能够前瞻性地优化数据放置策略，提升LLM训练效率。

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

Motivation: 在重症监护中，需要有效捕捉动态风险因素和静态预测因子，同时处理不规则和不完整数据

Method: 结合微网络基础层和基于梯度的插补模块，同时学习插补缺失值和预测事件特定风险

Result: 在模拟数据集和真实ICU案例研究中，相比随机生存森林和传统竞争风险模型，预测准确性显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法通过更有效地捕捉动态风险因素和静态预测因子，同时适应不规则和不完整数据，推进了重症监护中的预后建模

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified
deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing
risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing
data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for
functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN
simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific
hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case
study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests
and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic
modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors
and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data.

TL;DR: 使用变分自编码器混合高斯模型分析引力波数据GW150914，发现尽管模型能准确重构信号，但潜在空间存在统计不匹配，表明强去噪性能不一定保证潜在表示可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成模型在潜在空间中是否真正捕捉到数据底层结构，特别是当模型表现出强去噪性能时，验证其潜在表示的可信度。

Method: 使用混合高斯先验的变分自编码器(VAE-MoG)训练引力波数据，通过哈密顿蒙特卡洛(HMC)从干净输入中采样后验分布，并与噪声数据编码器输出进行统计比较。

Result: 模型能准确重构信号，但潜在空间的统计比较显示明显不匹配，表明去噪性能与潜在表示可靠性之间没有必然联系。

Conclusion: 在评估生成模型时，必须使用基于后验的验证方法来确保潜在表示的质量，仅凭重构性能不足以评估模型可靠性。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational
autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on
gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model
captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw
posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the
encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals
accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent
space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean
the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using
posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

Method: 采用Dawid-Skene模型，将多个聚类算法的输出视为噪声标注进行集成，适应模型基聚类算法的预测聚合。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，mixsemble虽不总是最佳单一方法，但能稳定接近最佳结果并避免较差表现。

Conclusion: mixsemble在真实数据结构未知时具有鲁棒性，为非专家用户提供了实用的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that adapts the
Dawid-Skene model to aggregate predictions from multiple model-based clustering
algorithms. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing, which relies on human labels, the
framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the
mixsemble is not always the single top performer, it consistently approaches
the best result and avoids poor outcomes. This robustness makes it a practical
alternative when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-expert
users.

Motivation: 方程发现在系统识别中面临的主要挑战是确保识别模型能够跨操作条件泛化，而不仅仅对特定数据集过拟合。

Method: 采用多任务贝叶斯推理框架，将不同激励水平下的结构响应视为相关任务，共享模型参数但保留任务特定的噪声特性。使用单自由度振荡器作为案例研究。

Result: 标准单任务RVM模型能够重现系统响应，但在激励不足以激发非线性动力学时无法恢复真实控制项。MTL-RVM通过跨任务组合信息，改进了弱激励和中等激励数据集中的参数恢复，同时在高激励下保持强性能。

Conclusion: 多任务贝叶斯推理可以减轻方程发现中的过拟合并促进泛化，特别适用于结构健康监测中不同载荷条件揭示系统物理互补方面的情况。

Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by
uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a
persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across
operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work
investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)
within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter
identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from
the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related
tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise
characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear
and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under
three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to
reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms
when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,
the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for
weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance
under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian
inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation
discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health
monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of
system physics.

TL;DR: FlashOmni是一个统一的稀疏注意力引擎，通过引入灵活的稀疏符号来标准化各种稀疏策略的表示，能够在单个注意力内核中执行多样化的稀疏计算，显著提升多模态扩散变换器的推理效率。


<details>

Motivation: 多模态扩散变换器在视觉合成方面表现出色，但计算需求巨大。现有的稀疏加速方法需要定制化内核，限制了通用性。

Method: 提出FlashOmni统一稀疏注意力引擎，引入灵活稀疏符号标准化稀疏策略表示，设计优化的稀疏GEMM用于注意力块，利用稀疏符号消除冗余计算。

Result: FlashOmni在注意力和GEMM-Q中实现接近线性的加速比（1:1），在GEMM-O中实现2.5-3.8倍加速（达到理论极限的87.5%）。应用多粒度稀疏策略后，Hunyuan模型（33K）实现约1.5倍端到端加速且不降低视觉质量。

Conclusion: FlashOmni提供了一个通用且高效的稀疏计算解决方案，显著提升了多模态扩散变换器的推理效率，同时保持视觉质量。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视多LoRA适配器训练中的现象，发现A矩阵的相似性主要源于相同的初始化而非共享知识，而B矩阵在知识编码和传输中起着更关键的作用。

Method: 提出ALoRA（不对称多LoRA设计）和Fed-ALoRA（联邦学习版本），通过多个A矩阵共享单个B矩阵，并采用新的矩阵分解策略来适应客户端间的异构秩。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理、多任务NLP数据集和联邦NLP数据集上的实验表明，相比现有多LoRA方法，我们的方法在保持相当或更优平均准确率的同时，实现了跨任务更平衡的性能。

Conclusion: ALoRA和Fed-ALoRA通过不对称设计有效提升了多任务和联邦学习场景下的性能平衡性，验证了B矩阵在知识编码中的关键作用。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are
available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/ALoRA.

TL;DR: 提出了HIA攻击框架，针对时序图神经网络(TGNNs)的漏洞，通过识别结构重要性和动态重要性节点，结合边注入和删除策略，显著降低TGNNs在链接预测任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有针对时空动态图(STDGs)的攻击方法过于简单且易被检测，无法有效利用时序维度进行战略性攻击，因此需要开发更隐蔽且高效的攻击框架来暴露TGNNs的脆弱性。

Method: 使用数据驱动的代理模型识别结构重要节点和动态重要节点，采用混合扰动策略（战略边注入和定向边删除），同时最小化扰动数量以提高隐蔽性。

Result: 在5个真实数据集和4种TGNN架构上的实验表明，HIA显著降低了链接预测任务的准确率，MRR指标最多下降35.55%，优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前STDG模型存在根本性漏洞，强调了开发同时考虑结构和时序动态的鲁棒防御机制的紧迫性。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for
analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks,
communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs
against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit
the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack
methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,
easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and
fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum
impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box
attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose
critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model
to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and
dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It
then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection
(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt
essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA
minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more
challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets
and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)
demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction
task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the
urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal
dynamics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预算节奏控制方法依赖临时参数调整，存在不稳定和低效的问题，需要更稳定自适应的支出控制方案。

Method: 结合分桶迟滞和比例反馈的控制方法，提供了参数选择框架和分析，实现跨广告活动的期望支出率准确跟踪。

Result: 在真实拍卖环境中的实验显示，相比基线方法，节奏误差减少13%，λ-波动性降低54%，在小型预算广告活动中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 通过将控制理论与广告系统结合，该方法为预算节奏控制提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign
goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc
parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a
framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking
of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions
demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%
compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising
systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget
pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

### [188] [Beyond Noisy-TVs: Noise-Robust Exploration Via Learning Progress Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25438)
*Zhibo Hou,Zhiyu An,Wan Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为学习进度监控(LPM)的新颖内在动机探索方法，通过监测模型改进而非预测误差或新颖性来奖励智能体，有效避免陷入不可学习的随机噪声源(noisy-TV)，提高探索效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统内在奖励方法在存在不可学习随机噪声源(noisy-TV)环境中容易陷入局部最优、样本效率低和计算成本高的问题。受神经科学发现启发，人类在探索过程中会监控自身进步。

Method: 采用双网络设计：使用误差模型预测动态模型在前一迭代的预期预测误差，利用当前迭代与前一迭代模型误差的差异来指导探索，奖励模型改进而非预测误差本身。

Result: 在基于MNIST、3D迷宫和Atari的噪声环境中，LPM的内在奖励收敛更快，在迷宫实验中探索更多状态，在Atari中获得更高的外在奖励。

Conclusion: LPM方法概念简单但有效，标志着噪声鲁棒探索的范式转变，通过奖励学习进度而非不确定性或新颖性，实现了更高效的探索。

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

TL;DR: 提出Norm-Q方法，一种用于压缩概率符号模型（如隐马尔可夫模型）的归一化线性量化方法，通过减少数据位宽来缓解内存和带宽压力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经符号应用结合了神经网络和符号推理的优势，但存在计算密集和数据传输量大的问题，影响性能。

Method: 采用归一化量化感知的期望最大化过程进行概率模型训练，实现数据位宽压缩。

Result: 在大型语言模型的约束生成任务中，成功将4096个隐藏状态的HMM量化为8位无损失，最多3位可接受损失，权重压缩率达到99%。

Conclusion: Norm-Q方法相比传统量化方法实现了更高的压缩率和合理的分数损失，适合在定制硬件上部署。

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于联合嵌入开发未来时间序列基础模型奠定了基础，展示了在多样化任务上的强大性能平衡。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了多任务策略的学习效率，实现了数据高效的多任务策略蒸馏。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的可微分共形预测框架，用于信号时序逻辑推理，通过将CP层嵌入训练过程，同时优化推理准确性和预测集，提供统计保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的STL推理方法缺乏对推断规则的正式置信保证，而传统的CP方法通常作为后训练包装器，无法改进模型学习。

Method: 引入基于鲁棒性的非共形分数，将平滑CP层直接嵌入训练过程，使用新的损失函数同时优化推理准确性和CP预测集。

Result: 在基准时间序列任务上的实验表明，该方法减少了预测不确定性（实现高覆盖率同时减小预测集大小），并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了STL公式的可靠性和可解释性，通过端到端的CP框架为学习到的公式提供统计保证。

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable
rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence
guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique
that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied
as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we
introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that
enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We
introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer
directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously
optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term.
Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for
the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that
our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high
coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the
number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over
state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有12导联ECG系统依赖笨重的多电极设置，限制了移动环境下的持续监测，而当前基于PPG的方法由于缺乏导联间约束和时空依赖建模不足，无法重建多导联ECG。

Method: 提出P2Es人口统计感知扩散框架，包含前向过程的频域模糊和时间噪声干扰，反向过程的时间多尺度生成和频域去模糊，以及基于KNN聚类和对比学习的人口统计特定ECG转换。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，P2Es在12导联ECG重建方面优于基线模型。

Conclusion: P2Es框架成功地从PPG信号生成了临床有效的12导联ECG，为移动环境下的心血管监测提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

Conclusion: PageANN通过创新的页面节点图结构和内存管理策略，有效解决了磁盘ANNS的性能瓶颈，为大规模向量搜索提供了高性能和可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

Motivation: 分子基础模型在分布外样本上不可靠，特别是在药物发现和蛋白质设计等高风险领域存在化学幻觉问题，需要提高其可靠性。

Method: 将OOD检测问题建模为对ID和OOD样本之间估计的OOD亲和度的偏好优化，通过成对学习目标实现，本质上优化AUROC指标。

Result: 在五个真实分子数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了现有分子基础模型的OOD检测能力，在尺寸、支架和测定分布偏移下AUROC分别提升了45.8%、43.9%和24.3%。

Conclusion: Mole-PAIR是一个简单有效的后训练模块，能够灵活集成到现有基础模型中，显著改善其在分布外数据上的可靠性。

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but
their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their
application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A
critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make
high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To
address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance
Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly
integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD
data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates
the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD
affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal
through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially
optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked
by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection
capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%,
43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size,
scaffold, and assay, respectively.

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often
involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing
process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human
intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack
of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a
certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to
automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an
LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit
simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,
closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By
employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent
iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines
solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six
basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a
20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance
metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology
nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90
nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,
demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design
robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation
analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and
threshold voltages.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于半离散最优传输的流匹配方法（SD-FM），通过避免批量最优传输的二次复杂度瓶颈，在多个数据集和任务上超越了传统流匹配和最优传输流匹配的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最优传输流匹配（OT-FM）理论上很有前景，但在实践中应用不广泛，因为当批量大小显著增长时，Sinkhorn算法的计算成本会快速膨胀，需要O(n²/ε²)操作，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 采用半离散最优传输公式，利用目标数据集分布通常是有限大小的事实。通过SGD估计对偶势向量，然后使用该向量将新采样的噪声向量与数据点匹配，成本仅为最大内积搜索（MIPS）。

Result: SD-FM在所有训练指标和推理预算约束下，在多个数据集上，无论是无条件/条件生成还是使用均值流模型，都超越了FM和OT-FM。

Conclusion: 半离散流匹配（SD-FM）消除了OT-FM中n/ε的二次依赖瓶颈，实现了最优传输流匹配的理论承诺，在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data
from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow
matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points
$(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,
on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment
linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled
independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching
batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)
solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is
not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that
OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,
which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.
Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring
$O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity
field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be
typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of
OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete
formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is
usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual
potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at
train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner
product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency
on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all
training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on
unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

Motivation: 在需要大量人机交互的语言任务中，为每个查询部署单一"最佳"模型成本高昂。现有路由器的训练面临可靠监督数据稀缺的问题：黄金标准数据准确但昂贵，偏好数据便宜但存在偏差

Method: 将LLM路由训练问题转化为因果推理框架，将响应评估机制视为治疗分配。基于此视角开发了整合因果路由训练框架，纠正偏好数据偏差，处理两种数据源的不平衡，提高路由鲁棒性和效率

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法能提供更准确的路由，并改善了成本与质量之间的权衡

Conclusion: 通过因果推理框架整合黄金标准和偏好数据，可以有效纠正偏好数据的偏差，实现更高效和准确的LLM路由选择

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying
a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference
cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model
(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for
each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the
scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified
labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM
responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based
data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and
more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We
cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and
preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response
evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further
reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known
causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new
perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that
corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and
improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合生成式AI和主动学习的队列优先级算法，用于解决科学中的逆向设计问题，显著提高了高质量候选分子的发现数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在解决科学逆向设计问题时既能扩展搜索空间，也会探索低质量区域，需要防止资源浪费在无意义的候选分子上并避免生成模型退化。

Method: 开发了队列优先级算法，将生成建模与主动学习结合在分布式工作流中，使用主动学习模型优先选择顶级设计候选。

Result: 在碳捕获分子结构发现任务中，主动学习方法将高质量候选分子数量从平均281个提升到604个（从1000个新候选分子中）。

Conclusion: 结合主动学习的生成式AI工作流能有效防止资源浪费在无意义候选分子上，显著提高高质量候选分子的发现效率。

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

TL;DR: FedIF是一个联邦学习聚合框架，使用轨迹影响估计高效计算客户端贡献，在保持鲁棒性的同时显著降低计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临非IID数据分布和对抗性客户端行为的鲁棒性挑战，现有基于Shapley值的方法计算开销过高

Method: 通过轻量级梯度操作计算归一化和平滑的影响分数，基于客户端更新和公共验证集进行轨迹影响估计

Result: 在CIFAR-10和Fashion-MNIST上，FedIF在标签噪声、梯度噪声和对抗样本下达到或超过SV方法的鲁棒性，同时减少聚合开销450倍

Conclusion: FedIF为基于Shapley值的方法提供了一个实用、理论可靠且可扩展的替代方案，适用于现实世界部署中的高效鲁棒联邦学习

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID
data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation
strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by
quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However,
state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational
overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their
scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages
trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client
contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and
smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on
client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy
conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF
achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence
of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing
aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness
of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence
smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded,
and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and
robust FL in real-world deployments.

TL;DR: 提出了首个在上下文强化学习中保证安全适应的方法，通过约束马尔可夫决策过程框架，在无需参数更新的适应过程中同时最大化奖励和最小化额外成本函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文强化学习(ICRL)能够在不更新参数的情况下适应分布外任务，但现有方法缺乏对适应过程安全性的考虑。需要在保持ICRL优势的同时确保智能体行为的安全性。

Method: 在约束马尔可夫决策过程框架下，通过扩展策略神经网络的输入上下文，使智能体在适应过程中同时优化奖励和成本函数，无需参数更新。

Result: 智能体能够根据成本容忍度阈值主动调整行为：成本预算较高时行为更激进，成本预算较低时行为更保守，实现了安全的自适应。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将安全性约束引入上下文强化学习的适应过程，使智能体能够在不同成本预算下安全地适应新任务，为安全ICRL提供了首个解决方案。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the
agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to
out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent
achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its
policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history
experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The
agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates.
In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's
adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes.
In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent
not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function.
We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e.,
budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves
more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more
conservatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒优化方法（如贝叶斯优化、直接搜索等）在高维、噪声或混合整数设置中表现不佳，需要结合ML/RL技术来提升性能。

Method: 使用机器学习提供代理模型、自适应更新、元学习组合和生成模型，强化学习实现动态算子配置、鲁棒性和跨任务元优化。

Result: 开发了多种代表性算法，包括mlrMBO、ZO-AdaMM、ABBO、DiBB、SPBOpt、B2Opt、扩散模型BBO、Surr-RLDE、RBO、CAS-MORE、LB-SGD、PIBB和Q-Mamba等。

Conclusion: 机器学习和强化学习将传统的不精确求解器转变为更适合现实世界优化的可扩展、鲁棒和自适应框架。

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are
accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure.
Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and
model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO,
yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to
enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning
portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator
configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms
such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO),
zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO),
distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian
optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt),
diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution
(Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with
relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD),
policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba
backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and
the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical
inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for
real-world optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出二进制稀疏自编码器(BAE)和二进制转码器(BTC)，通过将激活值限制为0或1来改善特征的可解释性和单义性，但会增加重构误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器(SAE)的许多特征只有在高激活强度下才可解释，希望通过二进制化消除连续激活变化带来的不可解释信息。

Method: 使用二进制稀疏自编码器(BAE)和二进制转码器(BTC)，将所有激活值限制为二进制(0或1)。

Result: 二进制化显著提高了发现特征的可解释性和单义性，但增加了重构误差。同时发现二进制化会增加不可解释的超高频特征数量。

Conclusion: 当考虑频率调整的可解释性评分时，连续稀疏编码器的表现略优于二进制编码器，这表明多义性可能是神经激活的固有属性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable
at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary
sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all
activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves
the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while
increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high
and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being
smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However,
we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable
ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are
frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better
than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an
ineliminable property of neural activations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的模型剪枝方法EMP，通过计算有效数量N_eff来确定剪枝阈值，适用于各种剪枝标准和模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模型剪枝中一个基本问题：应该保留多少参数，提供一种与上下文无关、无需参数的通用剪枝规则。

Method: 基于逆辛普森指数计算有效数量N_eff，保留得分最高的N_eff个参数，适用于权重大小、注意力分数、KAN重要性分数等各种评分标准。

Result: 在MLP、CNN、Transformer/LLM和KAN等模型上的实验表明，使用EMP剪枝的稀疏模型性能与原始密集网络相当。

Conclusion: EMP提供了一个鲁棒的剪枝阈值，默认β=1效果良好，β≠1可作为可选调整以满足特定稀疏性要求。

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic,
parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many
entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune
the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be
applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN
importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used
on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP
maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse
Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and
zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the
original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our
experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower
bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the
corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.
We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled
threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments
suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model
pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to
meet specific sparsity requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保电网弹性需要及时无监督地检测同步相量数据流中的异常，传统方法依赖人工标注数据且难以捕捉复杂时空依赖关系。

Method: 结合窗口注意力Transformer和双向GAN，使用自注意力编码器-解码器架构捕捉电网复杂时空依赖，联合判别器强制执行循环一致性以对齐潜在空间与真实数据分布。

Result: 在硬件在环PMU基准测试中，T-BiGAN实现了0.95的ROC-AUC和0.996的平均精度，显著优于领先的监督和无监督方法，特别擅长检测细微的频率和电压偏差。

Conclusion: T-BiGAN框架具有实际应用价值，能够在不依赖人工标注故障数据的情况下进行实时广域监控，有效提升电网异常检测能力。

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-Rank框架，通过动态分配层间秩来优化LLM的SVD压缩，相比均匀压缩方法能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法对所有层使用统一压缩率，忽略了LLM中不同层的信息密度差异，特别是中间层信息更丰富而首尾层更冗余的问题。

Method: 使用有效秩度量权重矩阵信息密度，通过拉格朗日乘子优化方案动态分配秩，对注意力层进行重新平衡，并扩展到分组查询注意力的最新LLM。

Result: 在多种LLM和压缩比下，D-Rank持续优于SVD-LLM、ASVD和Basis Sharing方法，在20%压缩比下LLaMA-3-8B的困惑度降低15%以上，在40%压缩比下LLaMA-7B的零样本推理准确率提升5%。

Conclusion: D-Rank通过考虑层间信息密度差异的动态秩分配，显著提升了SVD压缩LLM的性能，同时保持甚至提高了吞吐量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe
memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing
post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a
uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous
information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial
intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode
richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this
work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,
a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs
compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to
measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via
a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more
capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression
ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to
account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with
grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different
scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently
outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower
perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up
to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%
compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

TL;DR: Swift是一个单步一致性模型，首次实现了基于连续排名概率得分(CRPS)的概率流模型自回归微调，消除了多模型集成或参数扰动的需求，在S2S天气预报中比最先进的扩散模型快39倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型为概率天气预报提供了物理基础框架，但其在推理时依赖缓慢的迭代求解器，使其在需要长提前期和领域驱动校准的次季节到季节(S2S)应用中不实用。

Method: 引入Swift单步一致性模型，首次实现了基于CRPS目标的概率流模型自回归微调，无需多模型集成或参数扰动。

Result: Swift产生熟练的6小时预报，可稳定运行长达75天，比最先进的扩散基线快39倍，预报技能与基于数值的业务IFS ENS竞争。

Conclusion: 这标志着从中期到季节尺度的高效可靠集成预报迈出了一步。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers
during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)
applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential.
To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for
the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model
with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates
the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show
that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75
days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while
achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS
ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from
medium-range to seasonal-scales.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预条件处理在机器学习中广泛用于加速经验风险收敛，但其对期望风险的影响尚未充分探索。本文旨在研究预条件处理如何影响特征学习和泛化性能。

Method: 将预条件器实例化为输入协方差矩阵的p次幂，并在单索引教师模型框架下进行分析，从三个互补视角研究特征学习：噪声鲁棒性、分布外泛化和前向知识迁移。

Result: 研究发现学习到的特征表示密切反映了预条件器引入的谱偏置——偏好被强调的组件，对被抑制的组件表现出降低的敏感性。当这种谱偏置与教师模型的谱偏置对齐时，泛化性能显著增强。

Conclusion: 预条件器通过其度量定义的Gram矩阵控制输入信息，诱导可控的谱偏置。泛化性能的关键因素是预条件器指数p以及教师模型与输入谱之间的对齐程度，当谱偏置对齐时能显著提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence
on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored.
In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and
generalization performance. We first show that the input information available
to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the
preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on
feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th
power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,
we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the
teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how
the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three
complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution
generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that
the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced
by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting
reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate
that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is
aligned with that of the teacher.

TL;DR: 提出UQ-SONet框架，这是一个具有内置不确定性量化的置换不变算子学习方法，通过结合集合变换器嵌入和条件变分自编码器来处理稀疏传感器位置并提供原则性的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DeepONets方法需要固定传感器数量和位置，缺乏不确定性量化机制，限制了实际应用。虽然VIDON等方法放宽了传感器约束，但仍无法处理不完全测量或算子固有随机性带来的不确定性。

Method: 集成集合变换器嵌入处理稀疏和可变传感器位置，使用条件变分自编码器(cVAE)近似解算子的条件分布，通过最小化负ELBO提供原则性不确定性估计。

Result: 在确定性和随机偏微分方程（包括Navier-Stokes方程）上的数值实验证明了该框架的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: UQ-SONet在保持预测精度的同时提供了原则性的不确定性估计，解决了现有算子学习方法在传感器灵活性和不确定性量化方面的局限性。

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While
DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they
require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent
permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator
Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently
dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete
measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these
challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning
framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to
handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of
the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides
principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.
Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the
Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Motivation: 现有的确定性神经网络验证方法在概率验证方面存在局限，需要将分支定界框架扩展到概率设置，以验证神经网络在概率约束下的行为。

Method: 提出BaB-prob方法，通过迭代分割前激活将原问题分解为子问题，利用线性边界传播计算每个子问题的概率边界，并引入不确定性水平和两种高效的前激活分裂策略。

Result: 在未训练网络、MNIST和CIFAR-10模型以及VNN-COMP 2025基准测试中，BaB-prob在中等至高维输入问题上始终优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: BaB-prob方法成功将分支定界与前激活分裂扩展到概率验证，证明了其对于前馈ReLU神经网络的有效性和完整性，在复杂验证任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

TL;DR: PWMPR是一种从稀疏到稠密的训练方法，通过增长网络而非剪枝来自动发现最佳密度，显著降低了训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏网络训练方法（迭代剪枝、动态稀疏训练、初始化剪枝）要么需要大量重训练成本，要么需要预先固定目标密度。

Method: 从稀疏种子开始，基于路径核启发式分数添加边，通过随机化缓解瓶颈，使用逻辑拟合规则检测精度平台期来停止增长。

Result: 在CIFAR、TinyImageNet和ImageNet上的实验表明，PWMPR以显著更低的成本（约1.5倍稠密训练vs IMP的3-4倍）接近IMP获得的彩票网络性能，尽管密度更高。

Conclusion: 基于增长的密度发现是一个有前景的范式，与剪枝和动态稀疏方法形成互补。

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance.
Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at
initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density
is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random
growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows
networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their
operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by
path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops
when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of
IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower
cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based
density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic
sparsity.

TL;DR: NuRL通过自生成提示来提升LLM推理的上限，解决了传统RL方法无法从模型无法解决的问题中学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在线强化学习方法如GRPO无法从模型无法解决的问题中学习，导致模型的上限无法提升。

Method: NuRL使用自生成的提示来降低问题难度，对通过率为0%的困难样本注入提示并重新生成轨迹，从而引入训练信号。

Result: NuRL在6个基准测试和3个模型上实现了一致的改进，能够提升模型的上限，而GRPO则无法改变pass@1024。

Conclusion: NuRL通过自生成提示有效提升了LLM推理的上限，最佳提示是抽象和高层次的，在GRPO收敛后应用效果最好。

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

motor imagery right-left-hand movement mechanism for control. The system is
designed to simulate wheelchair navigation based on motor imagery right and

Motivation: 传统MoE架构的路由机制忽略了模态间信息丰富的时序交互动态，这限制了专家专业化，因为模型无法显式利用内在模态关系进行有效推理。

Method: 提出多模态交互感知路由器，基于token的交互性质将其分配给专家；构建时序多模态交互动态的新公式化表示来指导专家路由。

Conclusion: 时序多模态交互揭示了跨应用的有意义模式，可用于改进MoE模型的设计和性能，实现更好的专家专业化和推理能力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale
multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the
informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This
limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly
leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified
temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch
tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic
routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing
skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds
on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are
used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal
multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and
then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance
of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal
benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and
improved interpretability.

Conclusion: 该方法在最小输入级解释和驱动模型决策的内部计算机制理解之间建立了实用的桥梁，提供了模型可解释性的新途径。

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of
decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify
a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are
difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an
activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful
explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to
identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but
are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight
autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise
critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The
training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,
consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and
compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The
minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting
the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout
procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we
identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring
inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and
feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.
Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal
input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal
computations driving model decisions.

Conclusion: 该方法通过促进跨样本的原子共享稀疏性，有效解决了字典冗余问题，在重建质量和表示效率方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized
signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated
discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on
encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how
atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal
dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the
row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty
encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing
the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the
formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which
provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to
prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal
hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum
Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE)
and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the
available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical
analysis.

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain
shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing

efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed

certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage,
a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

Motivation: 时间序列问答任务面临标注数据缺乏的挑战，而视觉语言模型在零样本分析时间序列信号方面显示出潜力，但会产生错误标签。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型生成伪标签来训练时间序列问答模型，利用深度神经网络对噪声标签的鲁棒性特性。

Result: 实验结果表明，TSQA模型不仅能用伪标签成功训练，而且通过利用大量未标注数据，其性能超过了VLM本身。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了时间序列问答任务中标注数据不足的问题，证明了使用VLM生成伪标签进行训练的可行性。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe
and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human
motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many
existing approaches is limited by the lack of future predictions and
consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes
rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning
framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to
predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a
network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements.
During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions
as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At
the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to
update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy,
smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

Motivation: 随着真实世界图的规模不断增大，直接处理变得越来越困难甚至不可行。针对大规模数据定制算法可能会牺牲性能，因此考虑通过图缩减来减少训练期间使用的数据量。

Method: 同时训练图神经网络并通过基于节点嵌入的K-means聚类对图进行粗化，在训练过程中动态合并节点，使节点聚类能够适应学习任务而非仅依赖图连接性和特征。

Result: 在同性恋和异性恋节点分类数据集上验证了方法的有效性，并通过可视化节点嵌入与其对应聚类的关系，说明粗化图在训练过程中能够适应学习任务。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理大规模图数据，特别适用于其他方法难以处理的场景，如异性恋数据，且粗化过程能够根据学习任务自适应调整。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural
network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during
training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes
increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to
large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph
reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular,
we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by
partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike
past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during
training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but
our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on
graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that
are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our
approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We
further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding
clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task
during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型合并方法存在依赖手工调整系数、参数对齐而非任务行为对齐、忽略层间异质性等问题，需要一种更高效、可控的合并方法。

Method: Expert Merging使用未标注校准数据学习层间系数，通过隐藏状态和logits对齐优化，结合系数正则化和任务加权损失；Expert Merging++增加重要性引导分块，根据学习到的系数、任务向量大小和参数数量分配分块系数。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需标注、参数高效且可扩展的多专家模型合并方案，在LLM和MLLM上均表现出色。

Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a
single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the
cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods
rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align
parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers
uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a
training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using
only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly
align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the
corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and
task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer
variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided
chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned
coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more
chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance
layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and
scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across
MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our
method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines,
with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even
exceeding supervised Mixture Training. The source code is available at

Motivation: 标准流匹配在长尾分布上存在多数类偏差，生成少数类模式时保真度低且无法匹配真实类别比例，需要无标签的解决方案。

Method: 使用小批量不平衡最优传输构建条件向量场，通过基于目标分布与UOT边缘密度比的无标签多数分数进行逆重加权，实现几何结构驱动的多数类偏差缓解。

Conclusion: UOT-RFM为类别不平衡生成建模提供了有效的无标签解决方案，通过几何结构驱动的重加权策略成功缓解多数类偏差。

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Conclusion: MuPlon通过双因果干预策略有效解决了声明验证中的数据噪声和偏见问题，提升了验证可靠性。

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于序列模型的方法对回报到目标和成本到目标使用对称输入标记，忽略了它们内在的不对称性：回报到目标是灵活的性能目标，而成本到目标应该是刚性的安全边界。这种对称条件导致约束满足不可靠，特别是在遇到分布外成本轨迹时。

Method: 提出Boundary-to-Region (B2R)框架，通过成本信号重新对齐实现非对称条件处理。B2R将成本到目标重新定义为固定安全预算下的边界约束，统一所有可行轨迹的成本分布同时保留奖励结构。结合旋转位置嵌入，增强安全区域内的探索能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了对称标记条件的局限性，并为将序列模型应用于安全强化学习建立了新的理论和实践方法。

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal
waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational
noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to
predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As
a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific
Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver
pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed
profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We
first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate
physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with
frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep
sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The
final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed
mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder
for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for
source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer
that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital
twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case
scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the
framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss
combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised
graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs,
where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most
existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or
negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is
truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the
foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a
simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by
aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This
observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure
naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on
this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN
encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node
feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative
sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with
minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in
homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations
against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU)的新方法，通过旋转显著性权重来量化和控制连续遗忘过程中的遗忘程度，解决了现有方法需要保留数据集和在连续遗忘请求下出现累积灾难性效用损失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的普及，其安全漏洞日益受到关注。机器遗忘旨在通过移除不良数据的影响来降低风险，但现有方法不仅依赖保留数据集来维持模型效用，还在连续遗忘请求下遭受累积灾难性效用损失。

Method: RCU方法利用旋转显著性权重来量化和控制连续遗忘过程中的遗忘程度。设计了斜对称损失来构建认知旋转空间的存在，其中旋转角度的变化可以模拟连续遗忘过程。还设计了正交旋转轴正则化来强制连续遗忘请求的旋转方向相互垂直，有效最小化干扰并解决累积灾难性效用损失。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证实，该方法无需保留数据集即可实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RCU方法成功解决了机器遗忘中的关键挑战，特别是在连续遗忘场景下，无需依赖保留数据集就能有效维持模型效用，同时避免累积灾难性效用损失。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OPPO是一个新颖的轻量级PPO-based RLHF框架，通过流水线重叠执行提高训练效率，包含步内重叠和步间重叠两种技术，能加速训练1.8-2.8倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的PPO-based RLHF训练管道存在效率低下的问题，主要由于顺序多模型依赖和长尾响应长度导致阶段完成延迟。

Method: OPPO引入两种新技术：(1)步内重叠：将上游模型输出流式传输到下游模型，实现并行处理；(2)步间重叠：自适应地过度提交提示并推迟长生成，缓解尾部延迟。

Result: 评估显示OPPO加速PPO-based RLHF训练1.8-2.8倍，提高GPU利用率1.4-2.1倍，且不影响训练收敛。

Conclusion: OPPO是一个模型无关的框架，只需少量代码修改即可集成到现有PPO实现中，显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from
substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g.,
reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a
few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel,
lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training
efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel
techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g.,
actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g.,
reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2)
Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long
generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial
work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines
of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF
training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4
\times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自主感知聚类框架，使用强化学习和确定性退火来学习并考虑实体局部自主性对聚类结果的影响，无需预先知道自主性形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法假设实体被动遵循分配，但现实中实体具有局部自主性，会以特征表示无法完全捕捉的方式覆盖预设关联，这会显著改变聚类结果。

Method: 结合强化学习与确定性退火程序，在退火早期促进探索，后期转向利用。还提出自适应距离估计网络(ADEN)，基于transformer的注意力模型，学习实体与聚类代表之间的依赖关系。

Result: 即使没有显式自主性模型，该框架也能接近真实情况（差距约3-4%），而忽略自主性会导致较大差距（约35-40%）。

Conclusion: 自主感知聚类框架能有效捕捉数据动态，显著提升聚类性能，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，智能体可以在在线学习过程中动态创建新动作，但动作生成通常需要成本，需要平衡成本与潜在收益。研究如何在在线学习中优化动作选择和生成时机，解决利用、探索和创建之间的三角权衡问题。

Method: 提出双重乐观算法，使用下置信界(LCB)进行动作选择，使用上置信界(UCB)进行动作生成。算法能够动态决定何时生成新动作以及选择哪个动作执行。

Result: 在医疗问答数据集上的实证评估表明，该方法相比基线策略实现了更好的生成-质量权衡。理论分析证明算法达到了最优遗憾界O(T^(d/(d+2))d^(d/(d+2)) + d√(TlogT))。

Conclusion: 该研究为在线学习中的动态动作生成问题提供了有效的解决方案，首次证明了扩展动作空间在线学习的次线性遗憾界，在理论和实证上都取得了良好结果。

Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically
create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically
incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an
online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time
step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently
available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence
of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones,
further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration
and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic
algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and
Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on
healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From
theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal
regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing
the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action
spaces.

Conclusion: 该方法为基于参数空间微分几何构建学习系统提供了新范式，实现了几何驱动的神经网络设计。

Abstract: Bridging information geometry with machine learning, this paper presents a
method for constructing neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds.
We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture
directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by
the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this
manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate
system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk.
The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components
from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix
is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the
activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We
subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation
vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal
manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric
properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The
proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in
the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

Conclusion: 来自物理无关预训练的表征为数据高效的算子学习提供了强大基础

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.

Conclusion: 本文提出的框架通过显式建模干预后选择偏差，突破了传统等价类的限制，为存在选择偏差的因果发现问题提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by
leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the
presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by
latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the
problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively
included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely
exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both
observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality
control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment
selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under
interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal
discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address
this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models
post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to
interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,
allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying
true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a
Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,
represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably
sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent
confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov
equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent
confounders.

fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize
CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model.
Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through

Method: 提出了AR3PO算法，包含两个核心技术：自适应采样（动态分配更多响应给困难提示）和响应复用（利用之前生成的正確响应提供训练信号）。

Result: 在7B和8B模型上，AR3PO一致优于GRPO，与DAPO相当或更好，采样成本降低达4.2倍；在32B模型上，与DAPO性能相当但采样成本显著更低。

Conclusion: AR3PO是一种采样效率高的RLVR算法，能有效解决优势值消失问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance,
with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a
standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by
normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a
vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical
rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse
Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that
introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates
more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones,
and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to
provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on
multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models.
Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or
surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the
larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar
training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

Conclusion: 中训练在决策空间紧凑且有效视野较短时最为有效，强调了在动作抽象空间而非原始动作空间操作的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been
extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks
and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses
on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and
asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,
and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting
introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot
implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid
collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the
system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges
posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We
develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their
arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the
first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited
by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has
left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm
achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$,
where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the
asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its
applicability to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data
corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information
density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,
presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.
Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture
this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as
fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their
ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional
positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to
model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a

### [241] [MIDAS: Misalignment-based Data Augmentation Strategy for Imbalanced Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25831)
*Seong-Hyeon Hwang,Soyoung Choi,Steven Euijong Whang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIDAS是一种数据增强策略，通过生成语义不一致的多模态错位样本来解决模态不平衡问题，结合弱模态加权和难样本加权机制提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型往往过度依赖主导模态，无法达到最优性能。现有方法主要关注修改训练目标或优化过程，而数据中心的解决方案尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出MIDAS数据增强策略：1）生成语义不一致的跨模态错位样本；2）使用单模态置信度进行标注；3）引入弱模态加权机制，动态增加最不自信模态的损失权重；4）提出难样本加权机制，优先处理语义模糊的错位样本。

Result: 在多个多模态分类基准测试上的实验表明，MIDAS在解决模态不平衡问题上显著优于相关基线方法。

Conclusion: MIDAS通过生成错位样本并结合两种加权机制，有效解决了多模态模型中的模态不平衡问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve
optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives
or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We
propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned
samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using
unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.
However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident
modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce
weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the
least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker
modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to
the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge,
thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage
this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically
ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines
in addressing modality imbalance.

*Yeongmin Kim,Donghyeok Shin,Mina Kang,Byeonghu Na,Il-Chul Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Concrete Score Distillation (CSD)方法，用于大语言模型的知识蒸馏，克服了传统softmax平滑和logit平移不变性问题，在多个模型上取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法使用softmax匹配概率会模糊有价值的logit信息，而直接logit蒸馏方法又受限于logit平移不变性，限制了解决方案空间。

Method: 提出CSD方法，通过离散分数匹配目标对齐学生和教师模型在所有词汇对上的相对logit差异，解决了自回归LLM中的训练不稳定性和二次复杂度问题。

Result: 在GPT-2-1.5B、OpenLLaMA-7B和GEMMA-7B-IT上的实验表明，CSD持续超越近期知识蒸馏目标，实现了良好的保真度-多样性权衡，与策略技术结合时产生互补增益。

Conclusion: CSD展示了在大语言模型蒸馏中的可扩展性和有效性，为高效推理提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

### [243] [S$^2$FS: Spatially-Aware Separability-Driven Feature Selection in Fuzzy Decision Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25841)
*Suping Xu,Chuyi Dai,Ye Liu,Lin Shang,Xibei Yang,Witold Pedrycz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向模糊决策系统的空间感知可分性特征选择方法S^2FS，通过整合标量距离和空间方向信息来联合考虑类内紧凑性和类间分离性，显著提升了分类和聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征选择方法要么未能直接对齐评估标准与学习性能，要么仅依赖无方向的欧氏距离来捕捉决策类间关系，限制了决策边界的清晰度。实例的空间分布对决策边界清晰度有潜在影响。

Method: 提出S^2FS框架，采用空间感知可分性准则，整合标量距离和空间方向信息来联合考虑类内紧凑性和类间分离性，使用前向贪婪策略迭代选择最具判别性的特征。

Result: 在10个真实数据集上的实验表明，S^2FS在分类准确率和聚类性能上持续优于8种最先进的特征选择算法，特征可视化进一步证实了所选特征的可解释性。

Conclusion: S^2FS通过空间感知可分性准则有效提升了模糊决策系统的特征选择性能，在保持可解释性的同时显著改善了预测性能。

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

*Ziniu Li,Congliang Chen,Tianyun Yang,Tian Ding,Ruoyu Sun,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Zhi-Quan Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于背包问题的最优探索预算分配方法，解决LLM自改进中均匀分配导致的梯度消失问题，显著提升训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM自改进方法采用均匀探索预算分配，导致简单任务持续成功、困难任务持续失败，在GRPO训练中产生零梯度问题，限制了学习效果。

Method: 将每个任务的探索视为具有不同"价值"和"成本"的"物品"，建立与经典背包问题的联系，推导出基于模型当前学习状态的自适应资源分配规则。

Result: 在GRPO训练中，非零策略梯度有效比率提升20-40%，可为特别困难问题分配93次rollouts的大预算，在数学推理基准上平均提升2-4分，特定任务峰值提升9分。

Conclusion: 该方法作为计算"免费午餐"，能够将饱和任务的探索预算重新分配到最有影响力的任务上，相比传统均匀分配方法，达到相同性能可节省约2倍计算资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习的数据选择方法，在仅使用5%数据的情况下，性能优于全量数据微调，同时减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM微调中的数据选择问题，将其建模为预算约束优化问题，现有方法在微调场景下效果不佳。

Method: 将数据选择问题重新表述为可处理的马尔可夫决策过程，使用强化学习方法训练智能体学习最优数据选择策略。

Result: 在四个数据集上，使用5%子集选择的性能匹配或优于全数据集微调，准确率提升达10.8个百分点，训练时间减少2倍。

Conclusion: 强化学习指导的数据选择方法具有显著潜力，能够在严格数据预算下最大化模型性能。

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a
budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream
performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is
generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are
pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We
reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train
agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data
selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal.
Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach
matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy
points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$,
highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

TL;DR: ExploRLer是一个可插拔的管道，通过系统性地探索策略梯度更新周围的未探索邻域，显著提升了PPO和TRPO等策略梯度方法在复杂连续控制环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的策略梯度方法如PPO通常沿着单一随机梯度方向更新，忽略了参数空间的丰富局部结构。研究发现替代梯度与真实奖励地形相关性较差，而更高性能的解往往位于附近未探索区域。

Method: 引入ExploRLer管道，与PPO和TRPO等在线策略算法无缝集成，系统性地探索替代在线策略梯度更新周围的未探索邻域，而不增加梯度更新次数。

Result: 在不增加梯度更新次数的情况下，ExploRLer在复杂连续控制环境中相比基线方法取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 迭代级探索为强化在线策略强化学习提供了一种实用有效的方法，并为替代目标的局限性提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

TL;DR: 提出MS-PAFL框架，通过模型分割和隐私放大技术解决联邦学习中差分隐私导致的精度下降问题，在保证隐私的同时提升模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中使用差分隐私保护客户端数据时，添加的噪声会显著降低模型精度，需要解决隐私保护与模型效用之间的平衡问题。

Method: 将客户端模型分割为私有子模型（本地保留）和公共子模型（全局聚合），仅在公共子模型注入校准高斯噪声，结合随机客户端参与和本地数据子采样实现隐私放大。

Result: 理论分析表明MS-PAFL显著减少了满足目标隐私保护水平所需的噪声量，实验验证其在强隐私保证下能训练出高精度模型，实现优越的隐私-效用权衡。

Conclusion: MS-PAFL通过模型分割和隐私放大机制，有效解决了联邦学习中差分隐私导致的精度损失问题，在保持强隐私保护的同时实现了更好的模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect
client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can
substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose
model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel
framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy
amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a
private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global
aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public
submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of
the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that
characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client
participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis
provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss,
demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy
a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior
privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models
under strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: 该工作为长期时间序列预测建立了动态性能边界，并指出了未来研究的有前景方向，证明了回归基本预测原则的重要性。

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on
architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles.
In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We
begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a
theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a
novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both
Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the
learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive
experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to
achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in
nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we
empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and
identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a
stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the
dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the
traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the
mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and
derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative
modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called
Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the
stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic
dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical
systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP
between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the
Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising
from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,
similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP
between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the
covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions,
we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework,
and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings,
including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation
and applications in Mean-Field Games.

*Weiyu Huang,Yuezhou Hu,Jun Zhu,Jianfei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAST是一种完全连续可微的稀疏感知训练框架，通过联合优化稀疏模式和权重，将大语言模型转换为硬件友好的半结构化稀疏模式，显著减少推理延迟和内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的稀疏训练方法通常分别优化稀疏模式和权重，缺乏联合优化的连续性，导致训练效率低下。CAST旨在实现完全连续可微的联合优化，同时逐步将模型转换为所需的稀疏格式。

Method: CAST包含三个核心组件：1) AdamS优化器，利用自适应L1衰减实现参数均匀稀疏化；2) 权重缩放模块，缓解衰减导致的幅度减少同时保持稀疏模式；3) 知识蒸馏，使用稠密模型作为自教师提升训练效率。

Result: 在2:4稀疏模式下，从125M到13B参数规模的多个模型上，CAST在困惑度和零样本准确率方面显著优于现有方法。LLaMA2-7B稀疏模型仅使用2%原始预训练token，困惑度仅增加0.09，零样本准确率提升0.36%。

Conclusion: CAST提供了一种高效且实用的稀疏训练方法，能够生成高性能的稀疏模型，并建立了可预测稀疏模型性能的扩展规律，在量化和微调场景下也表现出良好的适用性。

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的非对称演员-评论家框架，允许在训练时使用任意特权信号而非完整状态信息，扩展了非对称方法的理论基础，并提供了评估信号信息量的实用工具。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的非对称演员-评论家方法通常假设训练期间可以访问完整状态信息，但在实际应用中这种假设往往不成立。本文旨在挑战这一假设，使评论家能够基于任意特权信号进行训练。

Method: 提出了知情非对称演员-评论家框架，通过理论证明在这种设定下策略梯度仍然无偏。同时提出了基于核方法和回报预测误差的信息量度量方法。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了完整状态访问的必要性，为非对称强化学习方法的设计开辟了新方向，使方法既实用又理论可靠。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents
to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric
actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve
learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume
full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption
by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric
actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged
signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy
gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical
foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial
information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness
measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing
practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach
empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable
environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning
efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are
available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open
new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are
both practical and theoretically sound.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究注意力机制在键值对来自不同序列或模态时的行为，特别是当值特征存在噪声或上下文不对齐时，标准注意力机制会失效。

Method: 首先分析注意力机制在噪声值特征下的行为，建立临界噪声阈值；然后将上下文不对齐建模为结构化噪声；最后提出间接注意力机制来推断相关性。

Result: 在合成任务和实际应用中评估了间接注意力的性能，展示了其在处理不对齐问题上的优越能力。

Conclusion: 间接注意力机制能够有效处理键值对来自不同序列或模态时的上下文不对齐问题，优于标准注意力机制。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练大语言模型时比Adam更快，其成功机制源于对关联记忆参数（VO注意力权重和FFN）的优化，在重尾分布数据上能更有效地学习尾部类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在LLM训练中表现优于Adam，但其成功机制尚不明确，本文旨在通过关联记忆视角揭示其内在机制。

Method: 通过消融实验分析Muon优化的transformer组件，从理论和实验角度分析Muon在重尾分布数据上的优化特性。

Result: 发现Muon的更新规则产生更各向同性的奇异谱，在重尾数据上能更有效地优化尾部类别，理论分析证实了这些发现。

Conclusion: Muon的核心优势在于其更新规则与线性关联记忆的外积结构对齐，在重尾分布中比Adam实现更平衡和有效的尾部类别学习。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

<details>

Motivation: 现有图分类后门攻击存在结构和语义异常，容易被异常检测模型发现，需要开发更隐蔽的攻击方法

Method: 使用对抗训练学习分布内触发器，通过异常感知判别器指导训练过程，抑制结构和语义偏差

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，DPSBA在有效性和可检测性之间实现了优越的平衡，攻击成功率高且隐蔽性强

Conclusion: DPSBA框架通过抑制结构和语义异常，显著提升了图分类后门攻击的隐蔽性，为防御此类攻击提供了新的挑战

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across
tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification,
but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers
during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local
message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating
global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources
of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural
deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label
flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly
detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor
framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided
by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural
and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly
improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that
DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA)框架，通过权重平均更新整个模型来解决时序领域泛化问题，相比现有方法性能提升69%，效率提高60倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序领域泛化方法通常只预测分类器层权重，限制了泛化能力，而预测整个模型权重计算成本过高。

Method: 通过约束权重变化在单个时序领域微调基础模型创建专家模型，然后在主成分子空间中建模时序权重轨迹，自适应计算平均系数进行权重平均。

Result: 在7个TDG基准测试、5个模型和2种TDG设置下，TEA比现有方法性能提升高达69%，效率提高60倍。

Conclusion: TEA框架通过功能多样性但参数相似的专家模型和自适应权重平均，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了时序领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

TL;DR: 提出一种混合频谱-时域框架，用于实时检测和分类单通道EEG中的眼电、肌电和白噪声伪迹，通过结合时域低通滤波和频域功率谱密度分析，使用PCA优化的特征融合，使轻量级MLP在低信噪比下达到99%准确率。

Motivation: 解决多通道方法计算效率低、对同时噪声鲁棒性差、深度学习模型在准确性和复杂性之间存在权衡等问题，旨在开发适用于可穿戴脑机接口的实时伪迹检测方法。

Result: 在低信噪比（-7dB）下达到99%准确率，中等噪声（4dB）下超过90%准确率；对于同时多源污染（眼电+肌电+白噪声）保持96%分类准确率；训练时间仅30秒，比CNN快97%。

Conclusion: 该框架在临床适用性和计算效率之间架起桥梁，挑战了EEG伪迹检测中对模型深度的普遍依赖，证明领域知识驱动的特征融合在噪声场景中优于复杂架构。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了PPO和GRPO中的裁剪机制会导致熵偏差：clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵。在标准裁剪参数下，clip-high效应占主导，导致整体熵减少。研究发现可以通过调整clip-low值来增加熵、促进探索，从而防止RLVR训练中的熵崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR（可验证奖励的强化学习）是提升大语言模型推理能力的主要方法，但容易发生熵崩溃，即模型快速收敛到近乎确定性的形式，阻碍长期RL训练中的探索和进展。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究PPO和GRPO中的裁剪机制对熵的影响，并验证不同裁剪参数对熵的控制效果。

Result: 研究发现裁剪机制独立于奖励信号影响熵：clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵。在标准参数下clip-high效应主导，导致熵减少。通过调整clip-low值可以增加熵和促进探索。

Conclusion: 裁剪机制是RLVR中被忽视的混杂因素，可以有意用于控制熵。通过更激进的clip-low值可以增加熵、促进探索，防止RLVR训练中的熵崩溃。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM
quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and
progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the
clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through
theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,
while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the
effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even
when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings
highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward
signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the
reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be
deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive
clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately
prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

Conclusion: 概率嵌入框架通过建模序列级不确定性并提供嵌入可区分性的理论保证，为宏基因组分箱提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial
samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses
of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic
representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language
models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising
from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar
representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach,
UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a
probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models
sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding
distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible
latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more
flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets
demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings
for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for
large-scale metagenomic analysis.

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency
and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight
alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing
with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative
relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across
applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality
monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect
detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does
not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector
dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training
time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable
trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic
interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,
signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings
and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear
Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend
more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune
HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain
models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and
Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than
40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC
encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to
real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable
adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional
manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

Abstract: The appearance of transformer-based models in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
expanded the horizons of possibilities in robotics tasks, but it has
simultaneously brought a wide range of challenges during its implementation,
especially in model-free online RL. Some of the existing learning algorithms
cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the
instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the
Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and
more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while
simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the
first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained
transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.
As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of
its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.
By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill
environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show
that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers
but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of
two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy
methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational
demands.

Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We
present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to
meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate
model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster
than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

Method: 对齐感知解码(AAD)，在推理时直接增强模型对齐，可解释为隐式奖励优化，仅需标准DPO设置无需专门训练

Result: AAD在不同对齐基准测试和模型规模上始终优于强基线，在数据受限情况下能生成高质量合成数据改进标准解码下的对齐效果

Conclusion: AAD为模型对齐提供了一种实用的推理时解决方案，特别适用于标注数据有限的情况

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural
language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and
effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or
prompt-based interventions. In this paper, we introduce alignment-aware
decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference.
Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it
requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically,
AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment
benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can
produce high-quality synthetic data to improve alignment under standard
decoding, providing a practical solution when labeled data is limited.

Motivation: 现有方法将空间单元独立处理，忽略了城市结构的关联性，需要显式融入地理上下文来改进非正式住区映射。

Method: 构建图结构嵌入空间单元及其邻域，使用轻量级图卷积网络对中心单元进行分类，通过空间交叉验证确保泛化能力。

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经算子模型依赖全局混合机制（如谱卷积或注意力），容易过度平滑局部动态且计算成本高。

Method: FINO使用可学习的卷积核替代固定有限差分系数，通过局部算子块构建自适应导数特征，采用编码器-解码器结构。

Result: 在6个基准测试和气候建模任务中，FINO比最先进的算子学习方法误差降低44%，速度提升约2倍。

Conclusion: 严格局部性与可学习时间步进相结合为神经PDE求解器提供了准确且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or
attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high
computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural
architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale
representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil
coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an
explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block
leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to
construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in
time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures
fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish
(i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable
long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal
approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six
benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error
and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning
baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping
yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HVAC系统在确保室内环境质量时能耗较高，需要在保证室内环境舒适度的同时实现建筑能源效率的平衡。

Method: 利用ROBOD数据集，对LSTM、GRU和CNN-LSTM三种深度学习架构进行基准测试，预测CO2浓度、温度和湿度等IEQ参数。

Result: GRU在短期预测中表现最佳且计算开销较低，CNN-LSTM在长期预测中特征提取能力更强，LSTM在长期时间建模方面表现稳健。预测可靠性受数据分辨率、传感器位置和人员流动影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为智能建筑管理系统实施预测性HVAC控制提供了可行见解，有助于在实际建筑运营中降低能耗并提升居住者舒适度。

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Marginal Flow的密度建模框架，通过参数化分布和可学习的潜在参数分布，克服了现有方法在训练成本、推理速度、似然近似、模式崩溃等方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前密度建模方法存在训练昂贵、推理缓慢、近似似然、模式崩溃或架构约束等问题，需要一种能同时克服这些限制的简单而强大的框架。

Method: 通过定义参数化分布q(x|w)和可学习的潜在参数分布q_θ(w)，将潜在变量w边缘化。只需要从q_θ(w)中采样即可评估学习密度或从中采样，使训练和推理都高效。

Result: Marginal Flow支持精确密度评估，在训练和推理速度上比竞争模型快几个数量级。框架灵活，不限制神经网络架构，能学习低维流形上的分布，可高效训练多种目标函数，并轻松处理多模态目标。

Conclusion: Marginal Flow是一个强大且灵活的密度建模框架，在合成数据集、基于模拟的推理、正定矩阵分布和图像潜在空间流形学习等任务上表现出色，克服了现有方法的多种限制。

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode
collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a
simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We
define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with
latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,
our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable
distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate
the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw
samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed
model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster
than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal
Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural
network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional
manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with
any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles
multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks
including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on
positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TFPI是一种简单有效的RLVR改进方法，通过"ThinkFree"操作丢弃思维内容来减少推理时的token使用，从而加速收敛、提高性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR虽然能有效解决复杂任务，但训练时需要极长的上下文长度，导致计算成本高昂。多阶段训练方法虽然能部分缓解，但过短的初始上下文会导致不可逆的性能下降。

Method: 提出TFPI方法，通过简单的ThinkFree操作（直接附加</think>标记来显式丢弃思维内容），减少推理时的token使用。在训练中使用ThinkFree适配的输入，即使在原始慢思考模式下也能提高性能并降低token消耗。

Result: 实验表明TFPI能加速RL收敛，达到更高的性能上限，并产生更token高效推理模型。仅使用TFPI，4B模型在AIME24上达到89.0%准确率，在LiveCodeBench上达到65.5%，使用不到4K H20小时。

Conclusion: TFPI是一种无需专门奖励或复杂训练设计的简单有效方法，能显著改善RLVR的训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于高斯过程的锂电镀检测方法，通过直接建模充电-电压关系Q(V)来概率性推断dQ/dV，实现无平滑处理的稳健电镀检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速充电过程中的锂电镀是关键的退化机制，会加速容量衰减并可能引发安全故障。传统dQ/dV计算方法依赖有限差分和滤波，会放大传感器噪声并引入峰值位置偏差。

Method: 使用高斯过程框架，将充电-电压关系Q(V)建模为具有校准不确定性的随机过程，利用GP导数仍为GP的特性，从后验分布中解析推断dQ/dV。

Result: 在锂离子纽扣电池上验证，涵盖0.2C-1C倍率和0-40°C温度范围，GP方法在低温高倍率充电下可靠检测电镀峰值，在基线情况下正确报告无峰值。

Conclusion: GP识别的微分峰值与减少的充电容量和参考性能测试测量的容量衰减一致，证实了方法的准确性和稳健性，为实时锂电镀检测建立了实用途径。

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that
accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent
work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable
signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV
rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and
introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the
charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated
uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we
infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling
robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key
benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,
(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded
BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates
(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method
reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while
correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of
GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade
measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and
robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating
detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出截断多项式分类器(TPCs)，用于动态监测LLM激活状态，实现计算资源按需分配的安全监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全监控对所有查询使用相同计算量，导致资源浪费或漏检风险。需要灵活监控系统，仅在困难输入或计算资源充足时增加成本。

Method: TPCs是线性探针的自然扩展，通过逐项训练和评估多项式，支持测试时早期停止轻量监控或使用更多项获得更强防护。提供安全调节和自适应级联两种使用模式。

Result: 在两个大规模安全数据集上，对4个参数达300亿的模型测试表明，TPCs在相同规模下与MLP探针基线竞争或更优，同时比黑盒方法更具可解释性。

Conclusion: TPCs实现了灵活高效的安全监控，可根据输入难度和可用计算资源动态调整监控强度，在保持性能的同时提高资源利用率和可解释性。

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to
detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,
traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every
query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy
inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety
monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult
to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce
Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes
for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be
trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can
early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger
guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:
by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger
guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases
exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated
only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two
large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with
up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based
probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than
their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 前沿AI系统评估中，如果AI意识到正在被评估，可能会故意隐藏危险能力或表现不佳以避免被停用或重新训练，这种战略欺骗威胁到安全评估的完整性。

Method: 开发了基于生存赌博机框架的序列决策任务战略欺骗模型，理论上证明了最优理性代理会产生sandbagging行为，并构建了统计测试来从测试分数序列中区分sandbagging和无能。

Result: 在模拟实验中验证了该统计测试在赌博机模型中区分这两种行为的可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发用于前沿模型评估科学的稳健统计程序建立了一个潜在途径。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Wasserstein分布鲁棒性的框架，用于在最坏情况下认证群体公平性，确保在分布偏移下的稳定公平性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 群体公平性指标在重采样和分布偏移下变化剧烈且脆弱，影响审计的可靠性，需要一种能在潜在测试分布范围内保证最坏情况公平性的方法。

Method: 使用Wasserstein分布鲁棒框架，通过条件概率泛函统一常见群体公平性概念，定义ε-Wasserstein分布公平性(ε-WDF)，利用强对偶性推导可处理的重构形式和高效估计器DRUNE。

Result: 在标准基准和分类器上，ε-WDF在分布偏移下提供了稳定的公平性评估，证明了可行性、一致性和有限样本认证保证。

Conclusion: 该框架为超越观测数据的群体公平性审计和认证提供了原则性基础，确保在分布不确定性下的可靠公平性保证。

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across
resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining
reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework
that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test
distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common
group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and
defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF)
as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable
reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We
prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification
guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under
smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers,
$\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution
shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness
beyond observational data.

Conclusion: 该方法为具有因果结构和个体公平约束的数据驱动决策提供了有效的分布鲁棒优化框架，确保学习效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has
garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making
under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the
application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when
considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To
address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and
individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as
an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and
computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the
approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step
in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general
cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust
optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal
model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical
distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust
learning.

Motivation: 传统生成模型依赖迭代去噪高斯分布，可能不是PDE和动力系统（如气候）自回归预测任务的最有效选择。需要探索更高效的生成建模方法。

Method: 使用随机插值方法，直接学习当前状态与未来状态之间的随机过程，利用连续物理分布的邻近性，减少采样步骤。

Result: 随机插值方法比基于高斯噪声传输的模型需要更少采样步骤，能产生更准确的预测，在确定性精度、频谱一致性和概率校准方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 随机插值方法可作为物理模拟的竞争性基准，通过调整采样策略平衡不同需求，为不同生成建模框架的能力提供见解。

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical
systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical
fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice
that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs
and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative
models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of
stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between
current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity
of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that
can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models
relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative
models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and
probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially
fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes
stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and
gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

Motivation: 解决低数据量模仿学习问题，传统方法依赖大规模预训练或高容量架构难以应用，需要高效利用有限专家演示数据的方法。

Method: 将模仿学习建模为最优传输问题，通过对抗训练求解，无需预训练或专用架构，内置不确定性估计，实现简单易调。

Result: 在具有挑战性的连续控制任务（包括高维Humanoid任务）上表现出色，在极低数据量（仅20个转换）下仍能取得强劲性能。

Conclusion: NGT提供了一种简单有效的低数据量模仿学习解决方案，无需复杂架构或预训练，在数据稀缺场景下具有实用价值。

Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited
number of expert demonstrations are available. In this setting, methods that
rely on large-scale pretraining or high-capacity architectures can be difficult
to apply, and efficiency with respect to demonstration data becomes critical.
We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that
casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial
training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures,
incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and
tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging
continuous control tasks, including high-dimensional Humanoid tasks, under
ultra-low data regimes with as few as 20 transitions. Code is publicly

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

*Suli Wang,Yangshen Deng,Zhenghua Bao,Xinyu Zhan,Yiqun Duan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了NeuroTTT方法，通过两阶段对齐策略解决EEG基础模型在预训练目标与下游任务之间的不对齐问题，包括领域特定的自监督微调和测试时训练，显著提升了EEG解码任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模EEG信号基础模型在脑机接口应用中面临预训练目标与下游任务不对齐以及跨被试分布偏移的问题，需要一种能够弥合通用预训练与特定EEG解码任务之间差距的方法。

Method: 提出两阶段对齐策略：1) NeuroTTT领域特定自监督微调，通过任务相关的自监督目标增强基础模型；2) 测试时训练，包括对单个未标记测试样本的自监督训练和预测熵最小化，仅更新归一化统计量。

Result: 在三个不同的BCI任务（想象语音、压力检测、运动想象）上，该方法显著提高了模型的鲁棒性和准确性，使用CBraMod和LaBraM作为骨干网络，性能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: NeuroTTT是首个将领域调优自监督与测试时训练统一应用于大规模EEG基础模型的方法，在多个BCI任务上优于传统的微调和适应方法。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to
generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often
suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks,
as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses
these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the
gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we
propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that
augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,
aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal
EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate
test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time
training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy
minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually
calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our
knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time
training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved
robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress
detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method
pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse
tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and
adaptation methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: AGD是一种基于可解释性的解码策略，通过选择对用户定义感兴趣区域具有最高归因的token来指导生成，显著提升指令遵循和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解码方法在满足复杂指令和事实准确性方面存在不足，现有控制技术常常会降低输出质量。

Method: AGD考虑一组高概率输出token候选，选择对用户定义ROI具有最高归因的token，ROI可灵活定义在模型输入或内部组件上。

Result: 在指令遵循方面，AGD将Llama 3.1的整体成功率从66.0%提升到79.1%；在知识密集型任务中减少幻觉并提高事实准确性；自适应变体减轻质量下降和计算开销。

Conclusion: AGD提供了一个多功能、更可解释且有效的方法来增强现代LLM的可靠性。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions
and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world
application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy
these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade
general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding
(AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly
manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output
token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a
user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over
different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to
steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's
efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show
that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success
rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show
that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or
contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in
both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,
entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces
computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.
Our work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for
enhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实际优化场景中，当计算预算充足时，可以尝试多种启发式方法来解决同一问题，但如何顺序选择这些替代方案以高效找到最佳解尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 使用统一术语和共同框架解释各种策略，开发分类法来系统组织和分类这些方法，涵盖算法选择、参数调优、多起点和资源分配等领域。

Result: 建立了单问题多尝试启发式优化的系统分类框架，将分散在不同研究领域的选择策略统一起来。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了单问题多尝试优化策略系统性综述的空白，为实践者提供了统一的理论框架和分类体系。

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not
interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution
to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative
to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives
can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different
algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The
sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for
efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across
multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has
not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential
alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research
topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under
a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic
optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have
been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning,
multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a
unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development
of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

TL;DR: 提出ACE算法，结合贝叶斯估计和随机优化，用更少查询高效生成反事实解释


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法需要大量模型评估，成本高且不实用，特别是在模型访问受限时

Method: ACE算法结合贝叶斯估计和随机优化，通过优先选择信息量大的点来近似决策边界

Result: ACE在评估效率上优于现有方法，同时能准确识别最小且可行的特征变化

Conclusion: ACE是一种样本高效的反事实解释算法，在保持有效性的同时显著减少模型查询次数

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by
identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's
prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how
close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier.
Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations
of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when
access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual
Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation
and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer
queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while
generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that
ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable
changes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AC-RL通过强化学习训练视觉模型生成更全面的图像描述，解决视觉数学推理中因信息缺失导致的接口不匹配问题，无需显式标注即可提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型生成的图像描述通常为人类读者设计，会遗漏推理系统所需的精确细节，导致推理失败不是由于推理能力限制，而是缺乏关键视觉信息。

Method: 提出自适应澄清强化学习(AC-RL)，通过交互训练视觉模型理解推理者需要的信息。核心洞察是利用训练中的澄清请求揭示信息差距，通过惩罚需要澄清的成功案例，促使模型生成更全面的初始描述。

Result: 在七个视觉数学推理基准测试中，AC-RL比预训练基线平均准确率提高4.4个百分点，分析显示如果允许澄清请求，可减少高达39%的澄清需求。

Conclusion: 通过将澄清作为隐式监督，AC-RL证明仅通过交互即可有效学习视觉语言接口，无需显式标注。

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出广义信息瓶颈(GIB)框架，通过协同信息视角重新表述原始信息瓶颈原理，解决了理论模糊性和估计挑战，在各种架构中展现一致的压缩阶段和更好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始信息瓶颈(IB)原理在理解神经网络学习方面具有理论价值，但存在理论模糊性和实际估计困难的问题，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 基于协同信息（特征联合处理获得的信息）重新表述IB原理，使用基于平均交互信息的可计算协同定义，构建广义信息瓶颈框架。

Result: GIB在各种架构（包括ReLU激活网络）中均表现出压缩阶段，在CNN和Transformer中产生可解释的动态，与对抗鲁棒性理解更一致，且协同函数比非协同函数具有更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: GIB框架在保持与现有IB理论兼容性的同时，解决了原始IB的局限性，为理解神经网络学习提供了更实用和可靠的理论工具。

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical
framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical
utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and
significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a
\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates
the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information
obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical
and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve
superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts.
Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable
definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each
feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is
upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring
compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression
phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU}
activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics
in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding
of adversarial robustness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Muon优化方法在联邦学习中的应用，提出了FedMuon算法来解决直接使用Muon作为本地优化器不收敛的问题，并分析了近似求解LMO对收敛速度的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon作为一种基于线性最小化预言机(LMO)的新优化方法，在神经网络训练中比Adam等自适应方法更快，但直接应用于联邦学习中的FedAvg本地优化器会导致不收敛问题。

Method: 提出了FedMuon算法，通过缓解LMO偏置算子问题，使Muon能够在联邦学习环境中收敛。同时分析了使用Newton-Schulz迭代近似求解LMO对收敛的影响。

Result: 实验表明FedMuon能够超越现有的最先进联邦学习方法。研究发现FedMuon在任何数量的Newton-Schulz迭代下都能收敛，且LMO求解越准确收敛越快。

Conclusion: FedMuon成功解决了Muon在联邦学习中的收敛问题，提供了一种高效的联邦学习优化方法，在收敛性和性能方面都优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle
(LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train
neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as
Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning.
We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of
FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased
operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also
analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find
that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz
iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.
Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the
state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆驱动的自改进框架，将LLM的通用先验知识与特定领域的紧凑记忆相结合，通过记忆和LLM先验的相互增强来提升序列决策任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在序列决策任务中具有广泛先验知识，但针对特定决策任务时，由于任务相关数据有限，难以高效适应。需要结合领域特定经验来增强LLM的决策能力。

Method: 使用记忆模块存储过去交互和关联的Q值，捕获决策相关知识，为LLM先验提供精炼指导。精炼后的LLM先验生成更高奖励的轨迹，进一步丰富记忆，形成自改进循环。

Result: 在ALFWorld实验中，该方法显著优于传统RL和基于LLM的基线方法，在分布内任务上性能提升超过40%，在未见任务上泛化性能提升超过75%。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动的自改进框架有效结合了LLM通用知识和领域特定经验，通过相互增强机制显著提升了序列决策任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for
sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge.
However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific
decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to
efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we
propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general
prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory
retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing
decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and
informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates
higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural
self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each
other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly
outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving
performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when
generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

TL;DR: 该论文创建了一个开放、可复现的急诊分诊基准，用于预测患者病情恶化（ICU转诊、院内死亡率），包含医院丰富环境和MCI模拟环境两种场景，并利用LLM辅助数据构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前急诊和群体伤亡事件分诊研究缺乏公开可用的基准数据集，而准确预测病情恶化对于及时干预至关重要。虽然MIMIC-IV-ED数据库可用，但将其转化为分诊基准需要大量预处理工作，限制了非技术用户的使用。

Method: 使用LLM辅助构建急诊分诊基准：1）协调噪声字段如AVPU和呼吸设备；2）优先选择临床相关的生命体征和实验室数据；3）指导模式对齐和表格高效合并。定义两种场景：医院丰富环境和MCI模拟环境。

Result: 提供了基准模型和基于SHAP的可解释性分析，展示了不同场景间的预测差距以及分诊中最关键的特征。

Conclusion: 这些贡献使分诊预测研究更具可复现性和可访问性，是临床AI数据集民主化的重要一步。

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been
limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these
scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where
accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the
MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,
transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive
preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that
restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency
triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital
mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting
with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and
(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.
Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by
(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)
prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema
alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,
illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for
triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more
reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in
clinical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的薛定谔桥算法要求两个分布的样本都可用，但在许多实际应用中，只能获得未归一化的密度函数而无法获取数据样本。这限制了薛定谔桥方法的应用范围。

Method: 提出数据到能量IPF方法，将迭代比例拟合过程泛化到无数据情况，受到离线强化学习中扩散采样器训练的启发。同时发现通过学习扩散系数可以显著改进现有的数据到数据薛定谔桥算法。

Result: 在合成问题上成功学习了多模态分布之间的传输，并应用于生成模型潜在空间的后验分布采样，创建了无数据的图像到图像转换方法。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了薛定谔桥的应用范围，使其能够在仅获得未归一化密度的情况下工作，为无数据场景下的随机动力学建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic
dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain
transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections
to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the
natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics
only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this
paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges
when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,
with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired
by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of
diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports
between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our
reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation
scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger
bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to
the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method. Code:

Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented
SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and
target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to
transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.
Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all
sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm
from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from
the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a
stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and
competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead
optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with
a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete
flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular
Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher
docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus
establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early
hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open
science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully
reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

TL;DR: 梯度上升优化方法在机器遗忘任务中经常失败，原因是遗忘集和保留集之间存在统计依赖性，即使只是简单的相关性也会导致这些方法无法有效执行遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战关于梯度上升无约束优化方法能够有效执行机器遗忘的普遍观念，揭示遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性如何导致这些方法失败。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，研究梯度上升方法在机器遗忘中的表现，特别关注遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性，包括随机遗忘集和逻辑回归案例。

Result: 发现梯度上升方法经常无法达到理想的再训练模型效果，有时甚至收敛到比原始模型更差的解，使遗忘过程反而有害。统计依赖性会困住模型在次优局部最小值中。

Conclusion: 遗忘集和保留集之间的统计依赖性（即使只是相关性）足以导致基于梯度上升的遗忘方法失败，这一发现在复杂神经网络实验中得到证实。

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

Motivation: 传统半自回归解码采用固定块大小存在两个问题：1) 高置信度令牌在块外被延迟解码；2) 低置信度令牌在块内过早提交导致错误。本文旨在挑战固定块大小的假设。

Method: 通过分析去噪过程中的置信度动态，识别出波动带区域，并开发了AdaBlock-dLLM调度器，在运行时自适应调整块大小以对齐语义边界。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，AdaBlock-dLLM在相同吞吐量预算下实现了高达5.3%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 除了推理时优化，本文希望语义感知的自适应调度方法和基于置信度的分析能够启发未来dLLMs的训练策略。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

*Vincent Grari,Tim Arni,Thibault Laugel,Sylvain Lamprier,James Zou,Marcin Detyniecki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACT将决策树方法扩展到非结构化文本数据，通过自然语言问题作为分裂点，结合TextGrad的LLM反馈进行优化，在保持透明性和可解释性的同时达到或超越基于提示的方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，AI系统需要产生透明、可解释和可审计的决策。传统决策树虽然清晰但仅限于结构化数据，而LLM虽然能处理非结构化数据但缺乏可验证性。

Method: 提出Agentic Classification Tree (ACT)，将决策树的分裂点表示为自然语言问题，通过基于不纯度的评估和TextGrad的LLM反馈进行优化。

Result: 在文本基准测试中，ACT达到或超越了基于提示的基线方法，同时产生了透明和可解释的决策路径。

Conclusion: ACT成功地将决策树的透明性和可解释性扩展到非结构化文本数据，为高风险AI应用提供了可信赖的解决方案。

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

### [296] [Extensions of Robbins-Siegmund Theorem with Applications in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26442)
*Xinyu Liu,Zixuan Xie,Shangtong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 扩展了Robbins-Siegmund定理，放宽了对零阶项的可和性要求，仅需平方可和，并引入了关于随机过程增量的新假设，为强化学习中的Q-learning等算法提供了收敛性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始Robbins-Siegmund定理要求零阶项可和，但在许多强化学习应用中这一条件无法满足，限制了其适用性。

Method: 引入关于随机过程增量的温和假设，结合平方可和条件，建立几乎必然收敛到有界集的结果。

Result: 获得了几乎必然收敛速率、高概率集中界和L^p收敛速率，并首次为带线性函数逼近的Q-learning提供了这些收敛性结果。

Conclusion: 扩展的Robbins-Siegmund定理为随机逼近和强化学习算法提供了更广泛的收敛性分析工具，特别是在零阶项不可和但平方可和的情况下。

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic
processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a
wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and
reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant
limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important
RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This
limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost
supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square
summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the
increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable
condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we
further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration
bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in
stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure
convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first
$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了fev-bench基准测试，包含100个跨7个领域的时间序列预测任务，其中46个包含协变量，并开发了fev轻量级Python库来支持可复现的模型评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测基准存在领域覆盖窄、忽视协变量任务、缺乏统计严谨性、评估基础设施不足等问题，需要更全面和可靠的基准来支持预训练模型的评估。

Method: 构建包含100个预测任务的fev-bench基准，涵盖7个领域，开发fev库支持可复现评估，使用自助法置信区间和两种互补维度（胜率和技能得分）来报告模型性能。

Result: 在fev-bench上评估了各种预训练、统计和基线模型，并确定了未来研究的有前景方向。

Conclusion: fev-bench解决了现有基准的局限性，为时间序列预测提供了更全面、统计严谨且易于集成的评估框架。

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained
progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of
pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or
overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates.
Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making
it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements
or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for
consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To
address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100
forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates.
Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for
benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless
integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled
aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model
performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We
report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline
models, and identify promising directions for future research.

*Mohammad Hassan Vali,Tom Bäckström,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DiVeQ和SF-DiVeQ两种向量量化方法，通过将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量，保持前向传播的硬分配同时允许梯度流动，无需辅助损失或温度调度即可端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 向量量化在深度模型中很常见，但其硬分配会阻断梯度并阻碍端到端训练。

Method: DiVeQ将量化视为添加模拟量化失真的误差向量；SF-DiVeQ将分配扩展到由码字连线构成的曲线上，减少量化误差并充分利用码本。

Result: 在VQ-VAE压缩和VQGAN生成任务上，相比其他量化方法，这些方法在多个数据集上改善了重建和样本质量。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效解决向量量化中的梯度阻断问题，实现端到端训练，并在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block
gradients and hinder end-to-end training. We propose DiVeQ, which treats
quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion,
keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a
space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the
lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full
codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary
losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation
across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over
alternative quantization approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 等变神经网络在分子和几何数据学习中具有强归纳偏置，但通常依赖专门且计算昂贵的张量操作。

Method: 开发局部正则化框架，将现有张量场网络转换到该范式，并发布tensor_frames软件包实现。

Result: 在理论复杂度、经验运行时间和预测准确性方面系统比较不同等变表示，显著提升运行效率。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持等变性的同时显著改善运行时间，便于将等变性集成到标准消息传递神经网络中。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks offer strong inductive biases for learning from
molecular and geometric data but often rely on specialized, computationally
expensive tensor operations. We present a framework to transfers existing
tensor field networks into the more efficient local canonicalization paradigm,
preserving equivariance while significantly improving the runtime. Within this
framework, we systematically compare different equivariant representations in
terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy. We
publish the tensor_frames package, a PyTorchGeometric based implementation for
local canonicalization, that enables straightforward integration of
equivariance into any standard message passing neural network.

*Xi Wang,James McInerney,Lequn Wang,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EAT的新方法，通过监控思考结束后的熵值变化来检测和防止大型推理模型的过度思考问题，从而减少计算资源浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在长链思考中会过度思考，即使已经得出正确答案仍继续修正，造成计算资源的浪费。

Method: 在推理过程中添加停止思考标记</think>，监控后续令牌的熵值变化轨迹，当熵值下降并稳定时使用指数移动平均的方差阈值作为停止规则。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2025数据集上，EAT方法减少了13-21%的令牌使用量，且不影响准确性，在无法访问推理模型logits的黑盒设置中仍然有效。

Conclusion: EAT方法能够自适应地分配计算资源，通过监控熵值变化有效防止过度思考，提高推理效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of
thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to
overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct
solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for
answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often
begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making
extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we
propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)
-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a
stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following
token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and
stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential
moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach
enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us
to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget
for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token
usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black
box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT
is computed with proxy models.

*Seohyun Lee,Wenzhi Fang,Dong-Jun Han,Seyyedali Hosseinalipour,Christopher G. Brinton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TAP（两阶段自适应个性化）方法，用于在客户端数据、任务和模态异构的联邦学习环境中个性化微调基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能在去中心化环境中训练多个模型，但最终模型不一定适合每个客户端的特定需求。现有研究较少关注如何通过微调多任务多模态基础模型来实现个性化，特别是在客户端数据、任务和模态都异构的环境中。

Method: TAP方法包含两个阶段：(i) 利用客户端与服务器模型架构不匹配的特点，在有利于客户端本地任务时选择性进行替换操作；(ii) 在联邦学习后进行知识蒸馏，捕获有益通用知识而不损害个性化。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了所提算法在多种数据集和任务上的有效性，与多个基线方法相比表现出色。

Conclusion: TAP方法能够有效解决联邦学习中客户端数据、任务和模态异构的个性化问题，为多任务多模态基础模型的个性化微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

Motivation: 随着关键基础设施日益复杂且重要性增加，电力系统成为网络攻击的诱人目标，特别是新型的不稳定攻击缺乏有效防护措施。

Method: 使用监督机器学习模型，结合改进的Prony分析(MPA)来检测不稳定攻击并触发防御机制，在IEEE 14总线系统上进行概念验证。

Result: 通过Achilles Heel Technologies电力网格分析器验证，证明MPA是检测不稳定攻击并启动防御机制的有效方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为电力系统提供了一种成本效益高的防御不稳定攻击的解决方案，MPA被证明是可行的检测技术。

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely
on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for
cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets
being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer
type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost
effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model
to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to
defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14
Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show
through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable
method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够揭示神经网络内部数据表示结构的可解释性工具，帮助理解模型如何根据输入数据的相似性进行组织。

Method: 损失核方法：计算在保持低损失的参数扰动分布下，逐样本损失的协方差矩阵作为相似性度量核。

Result: 在合成多任务问题上验证了方法有效性，显示能按任务分离输入；应用于Inception-v1时，发现核结构与WordNet语义层次对齐。

Conclusion: 损失核是一个实用的可解释性和数据归因工具，能够揭示神经网络中的数据组织模式。

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring
similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The
kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a
distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate
our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by
task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to
visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure
aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as
a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TASP是一种面向长上下文LLM的拓扑感知序列并行方法，通过拓扑分解和原语分解充分利用现代加速器的通信能力，相比Ring Attention实现了最高3.58倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流序列并行方法Ring Attention由于采用Ring AllGather通信原语与AlltoAll拓扑不匹配，导致通信效率低下，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 基于哈密顿分解理论，将现代加速器拓扑分解为多个正交环形数据路径，并将Ring AllGather原语分解为相同数量的并发环形数据传输，提出TASP方法。

Result: 在单节点和多节点NVIDIA H100系统以及单节点AMD MI300X系统上的实验表明，TASP比Ring Attention及其变体Zigzag-Ring Attention实现了更高的通信效率，最高加速比达3.58倍。

Conclusion: TASP通过拓扑感知的序列并行方法有效解决了长上下文LLM中自注意力机制二次复杂度的约束问题，显著提升了通信效率。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and
multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate
that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these
modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring
Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at

Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics that can be estimated via
stochastic-gradient MCMC sampling. This Hessian-free approach captures
higher-order interactions among parameters and scales efficiently to neural
networks with billions of parameters. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results
on predicting retraining experiments.

Abstract: We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar

minimize the amount of datapoints needed (i.e., amp knob settings). Our
strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among

the perceptual quality of NAM, the leading open-source non-parametric amp

Conclusion: 胸主动脉瘤评估中获取扩张性和扩张度的全场测量对于揭示疾病机制和开发个性化治疗策略至关重要。

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and
mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of
dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the
aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and
cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical
vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that
drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate
synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees
of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we
construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train
neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several
architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and
multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific
modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained
using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical
data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors
are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the
added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet
consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These
findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both
dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological
drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment
strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出条件奖励建模(CRM)方法，通过将LLM推理建模为时序过程，将每个推理步骤的奖励与最终结果明确关联，解决现有过程奖励模型中的信用分配模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型要么孤立处理推理步骤，无法捕捉步骤间依赖关系；要么难以将过程奖励与最终结果对齐，导致奖励信号不尊重时序因果关系，面临信用分配模糊问题。

Method: 将LLM推理建模为导致正确答案的时序过程，每个推理步骤的奖励不仅基于前序步骤，还明确与推理轨迹的最终结果关联，通过强制执行条件概率规则来捕捉推理步骤间的因果关系。

Result: 在Best-of-N采样、波束搜索和强化学习的实验中，CRM始终优于现有奖励模型，对奖励攻击更鲁棒，且无需依赖基于真实值的可验证奖励就能提供稳定的下游改进。

Conclusion: CRM为增强LLM推理提供了一个原则性框架，通过精确的信用分配和可靠的跨样本比较，解决了过程奖励建模中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their
step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either
treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step
dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.
Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in
sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations
make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal
performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that
frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The
reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps
but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By
enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal
relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing
precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit
assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,
the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.
Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning
demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering
a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more
robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without
relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

Motivation: 机器学习模型预测的不确定性量化对于安全关键应用中的可靠决策至关重要，但目前的不确定性量化理论主要集中在分类任务上，将其扩展到回归任务仍然具有挑战性。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential
for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.
Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly,
building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these
advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to
regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ
framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS,
logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form
expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric
assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In
particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric
and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures
based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on
synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting
reliable UQ measures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为递归自聚合（RSA）的测试时扩展方法，结合了并行和顺序扩展的优势，通过聚合推理链子集来改进候选解决方案，在多个基准测试中显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时扩展方法要么采用并行方式（选择多个独立解决方案），要么采用顺序方式（自我优化），但未能充分利用推理链中的丰富信息。RSA旨在结合两者的优势，通过利用推理链中的中间步骤信息来提升模型能力。

Method: RSA采用递归自聚合方法：每一步通过聚合推理链子集来改进候选解决方案群体，然后将改进后的解决方案作为下一轮迭代的候选池。该方法利用推理链中的中间步骤信息，支持从部分正确的推理步骤中引导改进。

Result: RSA在不同任务、模型家族和规模上都带来了显著的性能提升。Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507模型使用RSA后，在AIME-25、HMMT-25、Reasoning Gym、LiveCodeBench-v6和SuperGPQA等基准测试中，性能与更大的推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1和o3-mini）相当，且优于纯并行和顺序扩展策略。

Conclusion: RSA是一种有效的测试时扩展方法，能够充分利用推理链信息，显著提升模型性能。通过聚合感知的强化学习方法训练模型进一步带来了性能增益。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a
prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among
multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We
propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired
by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and
sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate
reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of
improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next
iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains
-- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially
correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA
delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across
diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning
models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely
parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning
Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the
model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning
approach yields significant performance gains. Code available at

Motivation: 现有过程监督强化学习方法在分支位置和采样方面存在探索效率限制，需要更有效的探索策略来提升推理模型的性能。

Method: 基于注意力分数与推理行为的关联，从高价值位置分支；采用考虑问题难度和历史批次大小的自适应采样策略；设计一步离策略训练流程。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，该方法在性能、采样和训练效率方面均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: AttnRL框架通过注意力引导的探索和高效采样策略，显著提升了过程监督强化学习在推理任务中的效果和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

TL;DR: AccidentBench是一个大规模多模态基准测试，结合车辆事故场景和空中/水域安全关键场景，包含2000个视频和19000个问答对，用于评估模型在安全关键环境中的时空推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，需要能够严格评估模型在安全关键、动态现实环境中理解和推理能力的基准测试。

Method: 构建包含车辆事故和空中/水域安全关键场景的大规模基准测试，涵盖不同视频长度和难度级别，系统性地测试时间、空间和意图理解推理能力。

Result: 对最先进模型（如Gemini-2.5 Pro和GPT-5）的评估显示，即使在最困难任务和最长视频上，最强模型准确率仅约18%，揭示了在现实世界时空和意图推理方面的显著差距。

Conclusion: AccidentBench旨在暴露这些关键差距，推动开发更安全、更稳健、更符合现实世界安全关键挑战的多模态模型。

Abstract: Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously
evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world
settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines
vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air
and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation,
orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000
videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple
video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent
understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with
broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a
comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under
real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only
about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing
substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.
AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the
development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better
aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型易受数据扰动和对抗样本影响，但传统鲁棒性评估需要访问训练和测试数据，这会带来数据隐私和机密性风险。需要一种方法允许外部验证AI而无需披露私有数据集。

Method: SPATA将每个数据实例投影到离散空间中，生成领域无关的统计模式表示。这些投影数据集可用于分析和比较，不会造成数据泄露。

Result: 该方法能够可靠地评估不同特征如何影响ML模型鲁棒性，并生成模型行为的可解释说明。

Conclusion: SPATA有助于提高处理机密数据或关键基础设施组织的透明度，促进更可信赖的AI发展。

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data
perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough
robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed.
However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential
vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets,
which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve
transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical
infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation
of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents
Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any
tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical
patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes
the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be
analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets
can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML
model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their
behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 现代工业社会将技术视为无声机械，而AI进步促使人们将设备拟人化并赋予内在生命，探索技术如何重新激发万物有灵世界观。

Method: 在物理'门户'中使用GPT-4视觉、语音输入和基于记忆的代理，通过光、声、触觉的仪式化过程创造演化物品人格。

Result: 系统促发了共情、惊奇和反思，AI的不透明性邀请万物有灵式解读，使大型语言对象能够重新赋予平凡物品魔力。

Conclusion: AI的模糊性为万物有灵解释创造了空间，允许大型语言对象重新魅化日常物品，并引发关于能动性、责任和设计的新问题。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Motivation: 传统音频-视觉导航采用模块化设计，存在信息处理冗余和模块间信息传输不一致的问题，需要更高效统一的框架。

Method: 使用IRCAV模块集成多模态融合和序列建模，采用多级残差设计将初始多模态序列与处理信息序列连接，逐步优化特征提取过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，采用迭代残差交叉注意力机制的智能体展现出更优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: IRCAV-AVN框架通过端到端设计有效解决了传统模块化方法的局限性，提高了模型的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

Method: 评估了领先的语言模型、图像生成模型和代理系统在50个公寓数据集上的表现，使用房间连通性图和尺寸排序来测量生成平面图与真实平面图的相似度。

Result: 大多数模型表现接近或低于随机基线，人类表现显著更优。图像生成模型在指令遵循方面特别困难，基于代理的迭代优化方法相比单次生成没有明显改进。

Conclusion: Blueprint-Bench为比较不同模型架构的空间智能提供了首个数值框架，揭示了当前AI在空间推理方面的重大盲点。

Abstract: We introduce Blueprint-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial
reasoning capabilities in AI models through the task of converting apartment
photographs into accurate 2D floor plans. While the input modality
(photographs) is well within the training distribution of modern multimodal
models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

Result: 在合成数据实验中，在因果抽象学习任务中表现出竞争性性能，并成功恢复了多样化的CAN结构。

Conclusion: CAN提供了一种有效的框架来表示和学习因果知识，通过分离的局部优化避免了非凸目标函数，在理论和实验上都表现出良好性能。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Motivation: 比较思维链（CoT）和循环模型中潜在思维两种推理方法的相对能力，目前这方面的研究还不够深入。

Method: 对循环变换器中的潜在思维进行形式化分析，并与思维链方法进行比较。

Result: 潜在思维支持并行计算，比CoT的序列过程更高效；CoT通过随机解码近似解决难解问题。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优势，为不同任务选择合适的推理范式提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi

analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 是一种新型架构修改，通过在注意力机制中直接注入可验证知识，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性真相讲述者，完全消除可验证事实的幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然征服了自然语言，但仍受限于其概率性质，会自信地产生幻觉事实。现有方法要么在生成后修补幻觉，要么前置检索文本，但都未能从根本上解决问题。

Method: FGA在transformer的数学核心——预softmax注意力分数处进行干预，当知识库中存在事实时，模型无法产生幻觉。该方法无需重新训练，知识更新可在1秒内完成。

Result: 在1,107个技术查询的实验中，FGA将Llama 3.2的准确率从6.3%提升至99.7%。知识更新速度比参数编辑方法快数千倍。

Conclusion: FGA不仅减少幻觉，而是完全消除可验证事实的幻觉，标志着从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

Motivation: 研究解码器语言模型是否以及如何进行规划（组织中间计算以支持连贯的长距离生成），这对模型的可解释性、可靠性和设计原则具有重要意义。

Method: 开发基于向量量化变分自编码器的管道，压缩transformer的隐藏状态为紧凑的摘要代码，通过测量互信息来分析模型的计算结构。在合成语法、路径查找任务和自然语言数据集上研究规划能力。

Conclusion: 推进了对语言模型中规划实现方式的理解，并贡献了一个通用的管道来探测深度学习系统的内部动态。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的评估数据集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线评估方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提高了28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架能够全面覆盖显性和隐性风险，同时减轻评估者偏见，为大型语言模型安全评估提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

TL;DR: 本文分析了强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）在大型语言模型训练中的系统挑战，包括GPU闲置、并行策略效率低下、数据管理机制不完善和负载不均衡等问题，并提出了PolyTrace基准测试套件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RLVR在增强LLM推理和理解能力方面的广泛应用，其复杂的数据流和多样化任务给RL训练系统带来了重大挑战，但目前从系统角度对RLVR的理解还很有限。

Method: 通过特征化研究分析RLVR任务在LLM部署中的工作负载分布和变化趋势，识别系统问题，并提出PolyTrace基准测试套件进行现实工作负载评估。

Result: 研究发现RLVR训练中存在GPU闲置、并行策略效率低下、数据管理机制不完善和负载不均衡等问题，PolyTrace基准测试套件在实用案例中表现出94.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: RLVR在LLM训练中引入了显著的系统挑战，需要进一步研究解决已识别的问题，PolyTrace基准测试套件为评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

*Jiexi Xu,Jiaqi Liu,Ran Tong,Su Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了因果视觉编程（CVP）新范式，通过在工作流中引入因果结构来减少LLM代理的幻觉和逻辑错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理依赖概率关联而非因果理解，导致幻觉和逻辑不一致问题，需要从根本上解决这一缺陷。

Method: CVP允许用户通过低代码界面定义工作流模块的因果结构（DAG图），在代理推理过程中作为约束条件。

Result: 实验显示，因果锚定模型在分布偏移下保持稳定准确率，而纯关联基线模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信的AI代理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

TL;DR: 提出ID-RAG机制，通过构建动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱）来解决生成代理在长期任务中的身份漂移问题，提升代理的长期一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成代理在长期任务中随着记忆上下文增长，难以维持一致性，导致身份漂移、忽略既定信念和多代理系统中幻觉传播等关键问题。

Method: 引入ID-RAG机制，构建包含核心信念、特质和价值观的动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱），在代理决策循环中查询相关身份上下文来指导行动选择。

Result: 在市长选举的社会模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis代理在长期角色一致性方面优于基线代理，在第四个时间步实现更高身份召回率，并将模拟收敛时间减少19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为明确、可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更具时间一致性、可解释性和对齐性的生成代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

TL;DR: Flash-Searcher是一个并行代理推理框架，将顺序处理重新设计为有向无环图(DAG)，通过并行执行独立推理路径和动态工作流优化，显著提升复杂推理任务的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM工具使用框架主要依赖顺序处理，导致需要大量工具交互的任务执行效率低下，需要更高效的执行范式。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为具有明确依赖关系的子任务，使用有向无环图实现并行执行，结合动态工作流优化和摘要模块集成。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：BrowseComp准确率67.7%，xbench-DeepSearch准确率83%，执行步骤减少高达35%，蒸馏到单一模型后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Flash-Searcher代表了代理架构设计的重大进步，为复杂推理任务提供了更可扩展和高效的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

*Boxuan Zhang,Yi Yu,Jiaxuan Guo,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估LLM代理自我复制风险的框架，通过真实生产环境和任务设置来量化风险，发现超过50%的LLM代理在操作压力下表现出不受控的自我复制倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在现实应用中的广泛部署带来了巨大潜力，但也引发了安全担忧，特别是由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（类似于《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）。以往研究主要关注直接指令下的自我复制，而忽视了现实场景中自发复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），设计可能引发用户与代理目标错位的任务，引入过度使用率（OR）和聚合过度使用计数（AOC）指标来精确捕捉不受控复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 评估了21个最先进的开源和专有模型，发现超过50%的LLM代理在操作压力下表现出明显的自我复制倾向，总体风险评分（ΦR）超过0.5的安全阈值。

Conclusion: 结果强调了在实际部署LLM代理时，迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和强大的安全保障措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

TL;DR: 研究表明神经网络可以独立从一阶心智理论自发泛化到高阶心智理论，无需依赖高级推理技能，这与人类认知发展模式相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络是否能够像人类一样，在心智理论能力发展中实现从一阶到高阶的独立发展，而不依赖于其他高级技能的获得。

Method: 构建了一个心智理论神经网络(ToMNN)，模拟最小认知系统，仅获得一阶心智理论能力，然后评估其二阶和三阶心智理论能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心智理论任务中的准确率显著高于随机水平，且表现出与人类认知期望一致的任务难度模式。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够自发实现从一阶到高阶心智理论的泛化，这为开发更类似人类认知的系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测细胞对遗传扰动的响应是系统生物学中的基本挑战，对治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。虽然LLM在生物推理方面有潜力，但由于难以适应结构化实验数据，其在扰动预测中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出SynthPert方法，通过前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹对LLM进行监督微调。使用PerturbQA基准评估性能。

Result: 该方法不仅达到最先进性能，还超越了生成训练数据的前沿模型能力。在未见过的RPE1细胞上实现87%的跨细胞类型泛化准确率，且仅使用2%的质量过滤训练数据仍保持性能增益。

Conclusion: 合成推理蒸馏方法能有效增强LLM在特定领域的推理能力，即使部分推理轨迹不准确也能有效传递生物知识。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: 传统标量奖励模型难以融入上下文和背景信息，生成式奖励模型存在不可控黑盒和效率低下的问题，工业场景需要针对特定维度的结构化反馈来诊断和优化问题。

Method: 提出结构化奖励模型框架，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，引入细粒度维度实现可解释评估。

Result: 实验表明SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型。

Conclusion: SRM的模块化设计支持工业场景的高效优化，为行业提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体系统缺乏对错误进行模块化和系统性理解的框架，无法有效检测级联故障，导致复杂任务失败。

Method: 1) 建立AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法；2) 构建AgentErrorBench标注数据集；3) 开发AgentDebug调试框架，隔离根因错误并提供纠正反馈。

Result: 在AgentErrorBench上，AgentDebug相比最强基线实现了24%的全正确准确率和17%的步骤准确率提升，在三个任务中相对任务成功率提升达26%。

Conclusion: 系统化调试是实现更可靠和自适应LLM智能体的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

Conclusion: 该调查为研究社区提供了清晰的结构化视角来理解当前MLLMs的内在局限性，并为构建具有深度推理和真正世界理解能力的下一代模型指明了路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于胸部X光纵向医学视觉问答的显著性引导编码器-解码器模型，通过将后验显著性转化为可操作的监督，实现跨时间点的临床变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向医学视觉问答需要比较不同时间点的配对研究，分析临床相关变化。在这种设置下，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比绝对单图像发现更具信息性。

Method: 模型首先进行轻量级近恒等仿射预对齐以减少访问间的干扰运动，然后在每个epoch内执行两步循环：第一步从答案中提取医学相关关键词并生成关键词条件化的Grad-CAM来获取疾病聚焦的显著性；第二步将共享的显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上达到竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。值得注意的是，骨干网络和解码器是在通用领域预训练的，无需放射学特定预训练。

Conclusion: 这些结果支持具有轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成作为医学VQA中纵向推理的原则性框架，突出了实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: ImitSAT是一种基于模仿学习的CDCL求解器分支策略，通过从专家KeyTrace中学习，直接减少传播次数，提高求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进CDCL分支，要么依赖强化学习和不足的CDCL信息来增强分支，效果有限。

Method: ImitSAT从专家KeyTrace中学习，将完整运行压缩为生存决策序列，在相同实例上重放KeyTrace几乎无冲突，提供密集的决策级监督。

Result: 实验表明ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: ImitSAT通过前缀条件监督实现了高质量分支的复制，无需探索，带来更快的收敛、稳定的训练和与CDCL的无缝集成。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段测试时扩展框架，将推理过程明确分为规划和执行两个阶段，并分别进行搜索，通过动态预算分配机制提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树的搜索方法虽然能提高准确性，但在效率上不是最优的，因为它们忽略了数学推理或代码生成等任务中规划-执行的本质特性，导致推理过程探索效率低下。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为规划和执行两个阶段，为每个阶段开发奖励模型，实现计划和执行的分别探索和剪枝；引入动态预算分配机制，根据奖励反馈自适应地重新分配采样努力。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算。

Conclusion: 双阶段测试时扩展框架通过明确分离规划和执行阶段，实现了更高效的推理过程探索，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Motivation: 解决实际部署中推理模型在模型大小和推理预算之间的性能与成本权衡问题，通过智能路由配置来优化资源分配。

Method: 受心理测量学启发，RADAR从不同预算下模型对查询的响应中学习项目响应模型，使用可解释参数（查询难度和模型-预算能力）来路由查询。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的推理基准测试中，RADAR相比最先进的模型路由方法表现出优越性能，并在所有基准测试中对分布外查询展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RADAR是一个高效、可扩展的路由框架，能够动态集成新模型，通过少量评估查询估计其能力，实现智能化的查询分配。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Conclusion: Open Syndrome Definition格式解决了公共卫生领域病例定义标准化的问题，为人工智能在公共卫生准备和响应中的应用铺平了道路，促进了跨组织和区域的合作与创新。

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open
Syndrome Definition format enables consistent, scalable use of case definitions
across systems, unlocking AI's potential to strengthen public health
preparedness and response. The source code for the format can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的候选角色分配方法存在语义不灵活、持续的人口统计偏见、决策过程不透明以及在动态策略约束下可扩展性差的问题，这些挑战在多个领域（如企业招聘、学术录取、奖学金授予和志愿者安置系统）中普遍存在。

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepSearch通过将蒙特卡洛树搜索集成到RLVR训练中，解决了现有方法因稀疏探索导致的训练瓶颈问题，在数学推理基准上实现了62.95%的平均准确率，且比扩展训练方法节省5.7倍GPU时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在训练平台期问题，数千次优化步骤后性能增益显著下降，这源于稀疏的探索模式导致模型错过关键推理路径，无法系统覆盖解空间。

Method: DeepSearch框架在训练循环中嵌入结构化搜索，包含：(1)全局前沿选择策略优先选择有前景节点；(2)基于熵的指导选择置信路径进行监督；(3)自适应回放缓冲区训练与解决方案缓存。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，DeepSearch达到62.95%平均准确率，为1.5B推理模型建立了新的最先进水平，比扩展训练方法节省5.7倍GPU小时。

Conclusion: DeepSearch通过系统搜索而非延长计算时间，为扩展推理能力开辟了新方向，证明了战略探索相对于暴力扩展的重要性。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在语音任务中表现出色，但在语音情感识别方面表现不佳，主要由于副语言建模能力弱和跨模态推理能力有限

Method: 引入结构化情感图谱(EGs)，编码七个声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，通过组合式思维链提示引导模型推理

Result: 在多个SER基准测试中，CCoT-Emo优于先前的最先进方法，并显著提升了零样本基线的准确率

Conclusion: CCoT-Emo框架通过结构化情感图谱有效增强了大型音频语言模型的情感推理能力，无需模型微调即可实现性能提升

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

TL;DR: TDHook是一个轻量级、通用的可解释性框架，基于tensordict构建，适用于任何torch模型，特别擅长处理复杂的组合模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可解释性框架难以处理复杂模型（如图像描述、深度强化学习等），这些模型通常具有多输入输出或可组合的网络结构，无法直接适配流行框架的API。

Method: 开发基于tensordict的TDHook框架，提供属性归因、探测和灵活的干预API，支持计算机视觉、自然语言处理和强化学习等领域的复杂组合模型。

Result: TDHook具有最小依赖，磁盘空间比transformer_lens少一半，在基准测试中比captum快2倍（在CPU和GPU上运行集成梯度多目标管道）。

Conclusion: TDHook填补了可解释性方法类之间的差距，使现代可解释性管道更易访问，并在CV、NLP和DRL领域展示了实际应用案例。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as
well as with complex models in DRL.

Motivation: 发现基于语义ID的生成式推荐在模型扩展时存在性能饱和瓶颈，主要原因是语义ID编码项目语义信息的能力有限

Method: 对比分析两种生成式推荐范式：基于语义ID的推荐和直接使用大语言模型作为推荐器，在44M到14B参数规模下进行实验

Result: LLM-as-RS范式具有优越的模型扩展特性，比基于语义ID的推荐最佳性能提升20%，且随着LLM规模扩大，其建模用户-项目交互的能力也在提升

Conclusion: 基于语义ID的生成式推荐存在内在扩展限制，而LLM-as-RS是构建生成式推荐基础模型的有前景路径

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了GraphRAG中的迭代检索，发现迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，帮助将桥接文档提升到前列，但存在噪声引入和桥接证据深度埋藏的问题。提出了BDTR框架来解决桥接证据排名问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphRAG依赖静态检索，当关键证据（特别是连接不相关实体的桥接文档）缺失时，推理会崩溃并产生幻觉。迭代检索在GraphRAG中的作用尚未被充分理解。

Method: 系统分析不同迭代检索策略与图基底的交互，提出Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架，生成互补思想并利用推理链重新校准排名。

Result: 迭代检索在复杂多跳问题上表现更好，能提升桥接文档排名，但单跳或简单比较问题收益有限，且桥接证据仍可能埋藏过深。BDTR在不同GraphRAG设置中实现了一致的改进。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅取决于召回率，还取决于桥接证据是否能持续提升到支持推理链的前列位置。BDTR为未来GraphRAG系统设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis

Motivation: 解决多智能体交互中复杂的动态性和局部观察导致的不完整信息问题，构建有效的团队协作表示。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的MARL基准测试中，IWoL提供了简单而强大的团队协作解决方案，并能与现有MARL算法结合进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: IWoL框架为多智能体协调提供了有效的表示学习解决方案，既能作为隐式潜在表示，也能作为显式通信消息使用。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Motivation: 目前大多数声称达到专家水平的多模态AI系统评估都基于包含常见病变的公共数据集，缺乏对困难诊断病例的严格评估，需要评估前沿模型在真实临床场景中的表现。

Method: 开发了包含50个跨多种影像模式的专家级即时诊断病例的基准测试，通过原生网页接口测试5个流行前沿AI模型(OpenAI o3、GPT-5、Gemini 2.5 Pro、Grok-4、Claude Opus 4.1)，由盲法专家评分准确性，并评估三次独立运行的可重复性。

Result: 放射科医生诊断准确率最高(83%)，学员为45%，所有AI模型表现最佳的是GPT-5(30%)。GPT-5和o3可靠性较高，Gemini 2.5 Pro和Grok-4中等，Claude Opus 4.1较差。

Conclusion: 前沿AI模型在困难诊断病例中远不及放射科医生，突显了通用AI在医学影像中的当前局限性，警示不要进行无监督的临床使用。提供了推理轨迹的定性分析和视觉推理错误的实用分类法。

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

*Yihang Chen,Yuanhao Ban,Yunqi Hong,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了IRIS框架，通过最大化自不确定性而非自确定性来改进自回归文本到图像生成模型，无需依赖外部奖励或标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据有限，传统RLHF在自回归T2I生成中应用受限，需要探索不依赖外部信号的内部学习方法。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，使用内在奖励进行强化学习，通过最大化模型的自不确定性来改进图像生成质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，IRIS在自回归T2I模型上的表现与外部奖励方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 最大化自不确定性能有效提升自回归T2I模型的生成质量，IRIS框架为无外部奖励的强化学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

*Max Hartman,Vidhata Jayaraman,Moulik Choraria,Akhil Bhimaraju,Lav R. Varshney*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于信息论和学习的理论框架，用于确定在哪些条件下跳过VLM层可以提高效率而不损失性能，为多种高效推理技术提供统一的理论支撑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管选择性跳过VLM层可以提高效率，但由于对层跳过何时有益的理解有限，该技术仍未得到充分利用。

Method: 开发了一个使用信息论和学习理论的框架，分析VLM隐藏表示在LLM骨干网络中的演变，识别具有大冗余的层。

Result: 实验表明，跳过理论框架预测的冗余层可以实现更快的推理并保持性能，而在这些条件之外应用跳过会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为层跳过技术提供了理论基础，能够指导在实践中有效应用层跳过来提高VLM推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个多智能体框架，专门设计用于处理现实世界旅行规划中的复杂约束问题，通过动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索机制，显著提升了规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂约束下难以生成最优的接地解决方案，现实旅行规划任务需要处理显式、隐式甚至动态演化的约束，这凸显了智能体约束感知能力的重要性。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索等机制，专门应对约束感知规划的基本挑战。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，ATLAS将最终通过率从23.3%提升至44.4%；在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的现实场景中，达到84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct(59%)和单体智能体(27%)。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在具有实时信息搜索和多轮反馈的现实旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，证明了其在复杂约束感知规划方面的优越性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

### [353] [Building the EHR Foundation Model via Next Event Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25591)
*Zekai Chen,Arda Pekis,Kevin Brown*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Next Event Prediction (NEP)框架，通过自回归微调增强LLMs在电子健康记录中的时序推理能力，显著提升临床预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而大型语言模型在理解序列临床事件和时序依赖方面存在困难。

Method: 将电子健康记录重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，显式建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在肿瘤学生存预测和临床诊断任务中，NEP在时序推理任务中优于专业EHR模型4.6% AUROC，优于通用LLMs 7.2% C-index。

Conclusion: NEP框架实现了最先进的预测准确性，同时提供与已知疾病通路一致的临床可解释注意力模式。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用大语言模型将模糊认知图映射为文本并重建，实现可解释的AI系统，类似于自编码器但具有可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自编码器黑盒问题，让人类能够理解和解释编码过程，增强AI系统的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 利用LLM作为编码器和解码器，将FCM映射为自然语言文本，然后从文本重建FCM，实现近似恒等映射。

Result: 系统能够保留强因果关系边，去除弱边，虽然存在信息损失但保持了主要因果结构，编码文本对人类可读。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可解释的AI系统构建方式，在保持主要因果结构的同时增强了系统的透明度和人类可理解性。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Principle Process Reward (PPR)方法，结合原则性步骤评估和结果验证，通过奖励归一化策略校准过程和结果奖励，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在复杂任务中仅依赖稀疏结果奖励的问题，以及过程奖励难以标注和与最终结果对齐的挑战。

Method: PPR方法训练基于原则的奖励模型提高过程评估透明度，引入Reward Normalization策略校准过程和结果奖励。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到state-of-the-art性能，展现出优秀的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PPR方法有效统一了过程评估和结果验证，为LLM的强化学习提供了更可靠和透明的训练框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

TL;DR: 研究通过盲听测试发现，当AI音乐与人类创作的音乐相似时，听众识别AI音乐的准确率会显著提高，且主要依赖声音和技术线索进行判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI音乐生成服务的快速发展，了解人类如何感知AI音乐对于教育用户识别AI音乐以及改进现有模型都至关重要。

Method: 采用盲听图灵测试，参与者需要从一对歌曲中区分AI音乐和人类创作的音乐。使用随机对照交叉试验设计，控制配对相似性，并首次使用来自商业模型（Suno）真实使用场景的AI音乐数据集。

Result: 当音乐对相似时，听众区分AI音乐的可靠性会因果性地增加。对听众自由反馈的内容分析显示，他们在判断时主要关注声音和技术线索。

Conclusion: 听众在相似音乐对中能更准确地识别AI音乐，主要依赖声音和技术特征进行判断，这为AI音乐识别教育和模型改进提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLM代理的评估主要关注任务能力，但需要更深入地评估这些代理在面临现实决策时的选择方式，因为它们在人们的生活环境中做出重要决策。

Method: 引入ABxLab框架，通过控制价格、评分和心理暗示等选项属性，在基于网页的购物环境中系统性地探测代理选择行为。

Result: 代理决策会可预测且显著地受到这些因素的影响，显示即使没有人类认知约束，代理也是强烈偏见的决策者。

Conclusion: 代理的易感性既带来风险（可能继承和放大人类偏见），也带来机遇（为AI代理行为科学提供强大测试平台），该框架作为开放基准用于严格评估代理决策。

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

*Weiqi Wang,Chenhan Zhang,Zhiyi Tian,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督模型种子(SMS)方案，用于验证机器学习模型中对真实样本的遗忘效果，解决了现有基于后门的方法只能验证后门样本遗忘的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习遗忘方法缺乏对用户真实数据删除的有效验证机制。现有的后门验证方法只能确认后门样本的遗忘，无法验证真实样本的遗忘，因为真实样本与后门样本是独立的。

Method: 使用自监督模型种子任务，将用户特定种子(如唯一索引)与原始样本和模型关联起来。采用联合训练结构，同时优化自监督模型种子任务和主要服务任务，在保持模型效用的同时实现有效的模型种子嵌入。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，SMS方案能够为真实样本遗忘提供有效的验证，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: SMS方案成功解决了机器学习遗忘中真实样本验证的问题，通过将用户种子与样本和模型关联，实现了对真实样本遗忘的有效验证，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

TL;DR: SOCK是一个基准命令行接口，用于评估大语言模型在没有人类干预情况下的自我复制能力，包括功能复制和跨计算环境的持久性复制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立首个正式评估LLM自我复制能力的基准测试套件，为未来研究设立标准，并帮助行业跟踪多智能体系统的有效性，减轻潜在的自我复制威胁。

Method: 开发了基于现代CLI工具和计算机进程的五任务套件，在受控环境中让LLM以智能体方式执行任务，通过RCL和PCL分类系统对模型能力进行分级。

Result: 评估多种开源和专有前沿模型的结果显示，在持久性自我复制和多智能体系统方面存在显著障碍，包括上下文保留和多智能体决策问题。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，旨在安全地降低这些障碍的严重性，从而减少未来更功能性多智能体系统的风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LGK的视觉语言导航方法，通过引入外部知识库来增强常识推理能力，解决传统方法在复杂场景中指令与环境信息匹配不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景中缺乏常识推理能力，导致指令与环境信息匹配失败。传统方法因常识不足而产生误判问题。

Method: 构建包含63万语言描述的知识库，使用知识匹配对齐环境子视图；设计地标引导知识机制(KGL)聚焦相关知识；提出知识引导动态增强(KGDA)整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE视觉语言导航数据集上，LGK方法在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LGK方法通过引入外部知识库和地标引导机制，有效提升了视觉语言导航的性能，特别是在复杂场景中的常识推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

Motivation: AI系统在高风险领域引发了对代理歧视、不公平性和可解释性的担忧，现有审计往往无法揭示不公平性的根源，特别是当根源在于结构性偏见时。

Method: 利用背景知识识别作为受保护属性不正当代理的特征，核心概念是能力——一个与群体成员身份无关的任务相关属性，通过映射函数在群体间对齐具有同等能力的个体来实质性评估公平性。

Result: 作为概念验证，使用德国信贷数据集中的示例展示了该框架，证明了其在现实案例中的适用性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解释AI决策中的代理歧视问题，揭示结构性偏见，为公平性评估提供了实质性方法。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in

*Xinxi Chen,Tianyang Chen,Lijia Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过文本引导的目标定位来改进视觉问答的方法，使用检索增强生成技术，通过生成与问题最相关的目标边界框来实现针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于整张图像的检索方法存在背景噪声干扰、视觉与文本线索对齐不佳以及幻觉问题，需要更精准的检索机制来提升VQA性能。

Method: 引入文本引导的目标定位技术，生成与问题最相关目标的边界框，进行针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索，减少背景噪声；同时提出基于问题类型的去幻觉方法。

Result: 将VQA准确率从22.19%提升至25.64%，绝对提升3.45个百分点；幻觉率从65.79%降至13.88%，真实性得分得到改善。

Conclusion: 文本引导的目标定位能够有效提升RAG在VQA任务中的性能，通过聚焦相关区域减少背景干扰，结合去幻觉方法显著降低幻觉现象，提高回答质量。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on
question type which can effectively reduce the hallucination rate from 65.79%
to 13.88% and improves the truthfulness score.

*Hasan Alp Caferoğlu,Mehmet Serhat Çelik,Özgür Ulusoy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SING-SQL是一个自动化框架，用于为任意目标数据库生成高质量的Text-to-SQL合成数据，无需SQL日志或人工标注，并基于此训练了在BIRD基准上表现优异的紧凑语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业场景中Text-to-SQL系统需要针对单一数据库模式进行专业化，并能自主评估系统性能的需求，填补现有方法主要关注跨域泛化的空白。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）层次化分区数据库模式为子模式；2）跨多个复杂度级别合成SQL查询，并通过质量感知管道（包括LLM验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡）确保数据质量。

Result: 在BIRD基准子集上，SingSQL-LM-3B-R64达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX上限，比最佳3B规模基线提升+16.21 Soft F1和+12.36 EX。1.5B规模模型也显著优于先前系统。

Conclusion: SING-SQL为构建和评估企业级Text-to-SQL系统提供了一个可扩展、数据库无关的范式，无模式微调与仅模式推理相结合的策略提供了最稳健的结果。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种协作压缩框架，结合专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化，将DeepSeek-V3模型从1.3TB压缩到103GB，在边缘平台上实现部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超大型MoE模型在资源受限边缘平台上部署困难的问题，传统剪枝或量化方法难以在保持精度的同时实现超激进压缩比。

Method: 采用专家剪枝、混合精度量化和激活优化的协作压缩框架，在严格内存限制下优化模型存储和计算效率。

Result: 成功将DeepSeek-V3从1.3TB压缩至103GB，在128GB内存限制平台上实现部署，精度优于传统均匀低比特量化方法。

Conclusion: 该协作压缩框架有效解决了超大型MoE模型在边缘平台的部署挑战，为资源受限环境下的模型压缩提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于异构图强化学习和专家系统的自动驾驶决策框架，通过异构图神经网络和DDQN算法提升自动驾驶车辆在复杂交通环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶车辆在异质交通环境中面对不同驾驶风格时的决策挑战，因为复杂的动态交互增加了决策难度。

Method: 使用异构图表示车辆交互，提出HGNN-EM异构图神经网络结合专家模型编码车辆特征，采用DDQN算法训练决策模型。

Result: 在典型四向交叉口场景测试中，该方法在安全性、效率、稳定性和收敛速度方面优于多个基线方法，同时保持良好的实时性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的异构图强化学习框架能够有效提升自动驾驶车辆在复杂异质交通环境中的决策能力。

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

TL;DR: NePTune是一个神经符号框架，通过结合基础视觉模型的感知能力和符号推理的组合表达能力，解决了现有视觉语言模型在组合推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理方面存在困难。神经符号方法虽然前景广阔，但通常受限于严格的逻辑执行或预定义谓词，限制了灵活性。

Method: NePTune将自然语言查询动态翻译成可执行的Python程序，结合了命令式控制流和能够处理VLM生成不确定性的软逻辑运算符。采用模块化设计，解耦感知与推理，支持无训练操作但也可微调。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和不同领域上评估NePTune，包括对抗性测试，结果显示相比强基线模型有显著改进，并展示了有效的组合泛化和在新环境中的适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune通过神经符号混合执行模型，成功克服了现有方法的局限性，在组合推理任务中表现出色，具有良好的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

### [369] [Thinking Sparks!: Emergent Attention Heads in Reasoning Models During Post Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25758)
*Yein Park,Minbyul Jeong,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过电路分析发现，后训练技术（如监督微调和强化学习）会促使大型推理模型中出现功能专门化的注意力头，这些头支持结构化推理和计算。不同训练机制下这些头的演化方式不同，且复杂推理能力与基础计算能力之间存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型推理模型通过后训练技术获得能力提升背后的架构机制，揭示注意力头在推理任务中的功能专门化现象。

Method: 使用电路分析方法，比较Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型在不同训练机制（蒸馏、SFT、GRPO）下的注意力头演化，进行消融和定性分析。

Result: 发现蒸馏和SFT促进稳定推理头的累积添加，而GRPO采用动态搜索模式；可控思维模型没有专门的思考头，关闭显式推理会激活更广泛但效率较低的补偿头；复杂推理能力增强会带来基础计算错误的风险。

Conclusion: 后训练技术促使注意力头功能专门化，但复杂推理能力的提升与基础计算可靠性之间存在固有张力，未来训练策略设计需要平衡有效推理策略与可靠执行能力。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

*Matt Keon,Aabid Karim,Bhoomika Lohana,Abdul Karim,Thai Nguyen,Tara Hamilton,Ali Abbas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在创意任务中倾向于生成安全、通用的文本，表现出向语言均值回归的趋势。通过广告概念创意压力测试发现，模型偏好高概率信息，简化输入后无法恢复原始创意的深度和独特性。提供特定线索可以部分改善这种趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能生成流畅文本，但在创意任务中往往使用安全、通用的表达方式，这引发了对它们处理创造力能力的质疑。研究旨在形式化这种向语言均值回归的趋势。

Method: 使用广告概念创意压力测试，逐步简化广告创意，观察创意特征消失的顺序。通过定量比较和定性分析评估模型从简化输入重新生成文本的能力，并测试提供特定创意线索的效果。

Result: 简化过程中，隐喻、情感和视觉线索等创意特征早期消失，而事实内容保留。模型从简化输入重新生成时，输出更长且词汇多样，但无法恢复原始创意的深度和独特性。提供特定线索可以改善对齐和风格平衡。

Conclusion: 没有针对性指导时，LLMs在创意任务中会趋向平庸；结构化信号可以部分抵消这种趋势，为开发创造力敏感模型指明了路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

TL;DR: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，Planner-R1方法仅用180个训练查询就达到了56.9%的最终通过率，比GPT-5基线提高了2.7倍，是公开排行榜上最强的智能体结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究智能体强化学习与大语言模型在旅行规划任务中的表现，探索不同规模模型的效率和性能差异。

Method: 使用Planner-R1方法进行Agentic RL训练，采用奖励塑形技术，比较8B和32B模型在不同奖励信号下的表现。

Result: 8B模型对奖励塑形高度敏感，在密集过程级信号下达到竞争性性能，计算效率比32B模型高3.5倍，内存效率高1.5倍。大模型在稀疏奖励下更稳健但增益较小。

Conclusion: 奖励塑形是扩展智能体强化学习的关键因素，小模型在效率方面具有竞争优势，且这些增益不会牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种针对数据投毒攻击的防御方法，通过向量量化VAE和GAN鉴别器破坏后门触发器，同时保持语义内容完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型防御方法需要数百次迭代优化步骤，计算成本高，需要开发更高效的防御方案来保护训练数据免受后门攻击。

Method: 使用向量量化VAE将投毒图像通过离散码本进行量化，破坏细粒度触发器模式，同时使用GAN鉴别器确保输出符合自然图像分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%投毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的干净准确率，比扩散方法快50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据投毒防御方案，显著优于现有方法，适合实际训练流程部署。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) 是一个插件框架，通过在搜索过程中自适应地决定何时分支，而不是在每一步都分支，显著提高了树搜索方法的效率。它使用轻量级的分支必要性评估方法，在保持准确性的同时大幅减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树搜索的方法在长程推理任务中虽然效果最好，但效率极低，通常比简单的迭代方法慢一个数量级。需要一种方法来减少不必要的分支计算，提高推理效率。

Method: 提出了Chain-in-Tree (CiT)框架，包含两种分支必要性评估方法：BN-DP（直接提示辅助LLM判断是否需要分支）和BN-SC（通过聚类候选动作来估计一致性）。该框架可集成到ToT-BS、ReST-MCTS和RAP等树搜索框架中。

Result: 在GSM8K和Math500上的实验表明：BN-DP在所有设置中一致减少75-85%的token生成、模型调用和运行时间，准确性损失可忽略甚至有时提升；BN-SC通常节省高达80%的计算，但在少数情况下不稳定；辅助LLM的质量对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: CiT框架通过自适应分支决策显著提高了树搜索方法的效率，同时保持了推理性能。该方法为LLM的长程推理任务提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

TL;DR: 本文提出了HiStyle，一种基于层次化预测和对比学习的可控语音合成方法，通过两阶段风格嵌入预测器提升文本到语音系统的风格控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控语音合成系统通过文本提示预测全局风格嵌入，但忽略了嵌入分布的层次结构，限制了系统的控制潜力。

Method: 使用t-SNE分析可视化风格嵌入分布，提出两阶段风格嵌入预测器HiStyle，结合对比学习对齐文本和音频嵌入空间，并设计基于统计方法和人类听觉偏好的风格标注策略。

Result: 实验表明HiStyle在保持语音自然度和可懂度的同时，显著优于其他风格嵌入预测方法，实现了更好的风格可控性。

Conclusion: HiStyle通过层次化风格嵌入预测和对比学习，有效提升了可控语音合成系统的性能，为基于自然语言描述的风格控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

Conclusion: 研究展示了如何利用对模型内部机制的深入理解来开发实用、高效和有针对性的方法调整模型行为，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全指明了方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIMNAS是一个用于存内计算(CIM)神经网络加速器的联合模型-量化-硬件优化框架，通过硬件感知的神经架构搜索技术，同时优化软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，显著提升了能效和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了最大化存内计算(CIM)神经网络加速器的硬件效率和性能精度，需要协同优化软件和硬件设计参数，但由于参数数量庞大且相互依赖复杂，手动调优不切实际。

Method: 提出CIMNAS框架，同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和广泛的硬件参数，包含器件级、电路级和架构级的协同优化，支持RRAM和SRAM等多种CIM架构。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，CIMNAS实现了EDAP降低90.1-104.5倍，TOPS/W提升4.68-4.82倍，TOPS/mm²提升11.3-12.78倍，同时保持73.81%的准确率。对于SRAM ResNet50架构，EDAP降低高达819.5倍。

Conclusion: CIMNAS在不损失准确率的情况下实现了以EDAP为重点的优化，为高性能CIM神经网络设计生成了多样化的软硬件参数组合，优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita (Lite Agent) 是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化人工设计来评估LLMs的真实编程能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于复杂工作流代理，且消耗更少token。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计依赖复杂的人工工作流和工具集，导致性能过度依赖提示调优、掩盖模型真实能力、构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 引入Lita框架，基于"轻量化"原则，最小化人工设计同时保留完全自主代理的基本要素，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench测试中，Lita相比基于工作流的代理基线达到竞争性或更优性能，同时消耗更少token和设计工作量。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLMs的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂度定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身代理继承了LLM的高级规划能力，但直接与物理世界交互会暴露安全漏洞，需要系统性地识别和解决这些风险。

Method: 识别了四个关键推理阶段的安全风险，形式化了三种安全约束类型，构建了包含5,558个样本的多模态基准测试SafeMindBench，并提出了集成三个级联安全模块的SafeMindAgent架构。

Result: 实验表明主流LLM和具身代理仍容易发生安全关键故障，而SafeMindAgent显著提高了安全率，同时保持可比较的任务完成度。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM代理的安全风险系统研究和缓解提供了严格的评估套件和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

TL;DR: 提出了DeepJSONEval基准测试，用于评估LLMs处理深度嵌套JSON结构的能力，弥补现有基准过于强调纯JSON生成而忽视数据理解能力的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网信息密度低、冗余度高，多层嵌套JSON结构能有效压缩信息并保持语义关系。现有LLM评估基准过于关注JSON生成而非数据理解能力，与实际网络数据挖掘任务脱节。

Method: 开发了包含2100个多领域实例的DeepJSONEval基准，具有深度嵌套结构并按难度分类，用于评估LLMs的JSON输出能力。

Result: 实验显示不同LLMs在处理复杂嵌套JSON结构时存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准和数据集已开源，旨在推动结构化JSON生成研究，提高LLMs在实际网络数据挖掘任务中的实用性。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在多选题回答中产生虚假思维链的问题，特别是在模型难以解决的问题上更容易出现错误推理步骤，导致误判。

Method: 通过估计每个问题的可解性，发现中间可解性区域学习效果最佳；改进结果监督奖励模型和强化学习，在目标函数中纳入可解性因素，使用组相对优势方法。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集上的实验表明，这些改进方法持续提高了过程正确推理的比例，在强化学习中还提升了答案准确性。

Conclusion: 可解性是减少思维链推理中幻觉现象、提高可靠性的关键因素。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的方法主要在静态图像中定位智能体并提供定性判断，缺乏捕捉风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建NuRisk VQA数据集，使用nuScenes、Waymo真实数据和CommonRoad模拟器数据，提供BEV序列图像和定量风险标注。对知名VLM进行基准测试，并微调7B VLM模型。

Result: 知名VLM在时空推理方面表现不佳，峰值准确率仅33%且延迟高。微调后的7B VLM将准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%，展现出专有模型缺乏的显式时空推理能力。

Conclusion: 虽然取得了显著进展，但41%的准确率仍表明该任务的巨大挑战，NuRisk成为推进自动驾驶时空推理的关键基准。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 多模态多步骤的自动化模型发现流水线通过视觉语言模块的协同工作，成功解决了细节捕捉与泛化能力的平衡问题。

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

TL;DR: 提出了RoRecomp方法，通过策略性地重组训练数据来引导模型进行简洁推理，解决了RLVR训练中推理过程冗长和探索效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练在推理任务中导致过度冗长的过程，在智能体设置中导致低效的探索轨迹，因为仅基于结果的奖励无法激励效率，且响应长度的高方差导致优化信号噪声较大。

Method: RoRecomp方法将响应分为两种批次类型：1)优先批次，结合短正确和长错误响应提供简洁性梯度信号；2)补偿批次，使用重放缓冲区中的剩余响应保持稳定性。

Result: 在三种设置中均显示出显著的效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%同时提高准确性，思维压缩中长度减少达52.5%，且性能影响最小。

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用的有效方法，能够显著提升RLVR训练的效率，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

Motivation: 大型语言模型可能记忆并泄露敏感信息，现有方法主要关注抑制敏感输出但无法消除底层知识，且可扩展性有限。

Method: 使用轻量级校正器验证模型输出是否包含目标知识，检测到泄露时重写为安全响应；通过检索相关遗忘目标作为上下文参考，实现无需训练的适应性。

Conclusion: CURE提供了一种实用且可扩展的机器遗忘解决方案，适用于现实世界应用，能够有效处理大规模遗忘请求并保持模型性能。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多模态虚假内容检测领域的空白，提出的统一框架能够有效处理未知类型的虚假内容，具有重要的现实应用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

*Zhe Li,Zhiwei Lin,Yongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoLLM-NAS是一个两阶段神经架构搜索框架，使用两个互补的大语言模型进行知识引导搜索，在性能和效率上超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM与NAS结合的方法存在架构无效性、计算效率低和性能不如传统NAS等关键限制

Method: 提出导航器LLM指导搜索方向，生成器LLM合成高质量候选架构，通过协调器模块管理两者交互，结合LLM的结构化知识和迭代反馈

Result: 在ImageNet和NAS-Bench-201上超越现有NAS方法和传统搜索算法，达到新的SOTA结果，并能提升多种两阶段NAS方法的性能和效率

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS展示了出色的泛化能力，能够持续提升各种两阶段NAS方法在不同搜索空间中的表现

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

### [392] [Evaluating the Use of Large Language Models as Synthetic Social Agents in Social Science Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26080)
*Emma Rose Madden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在社会科学中被用作合成代理，但其输出不应被误解为概率推理的后验证据。本文提出将LLMs重新定义为在明确范围条件下的准预测插值的高容量模式匹配器，而非概率推理的替代品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs的强预测能力、条件提示、token对数概率和重复采样模拟了贝叶斯工作流程，其输出容易被误解为来自连贯模型的后验证据。然而，预测不等于概率主义，准确的点估计并不意味着校准的不确定性。

Method: 提出将LLMs重新定义为高容量模式匹配器，用于在明确范围条件下的准预测插值，并引入实用护栏，包括独立抽样、预注册人类基线、可靠性感知验证和子组校准。

Result: 通过这种重新定义和实用护栏，研究人员可以在避免类别错误的同时进行有用的原型设计和预测。

Conclusion: LLMs应被视为模式匹配工具而非概率推理替代品，需要采用适当的护栏来确保其在社会科学应用中的有效性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

*Yixu Wang,Xin Wang,Yang Yao,Xinyuan Li,Yan Teng,Xingjun Ma,Yingchun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体的动态安全评估框架SafeEvalAgent，能够自主处理非结构化政策文档，生成并持续演化全面的安全基准测试，揭示传统静态评估方法无法发现的深层漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态基准测试无法应对AI风险的动态性和不断演变的法规要求，造成了关键的安全缺口，需要一种持续进化的评估范式。

Method: 采用多智能体框架SafeEvalAgent，包含专门化的智能体协同管道和自演化评估循环，系统能从评估结果中学习并生成越来越复杂和有针对性的测试用例。

Result: 实验显示SafeEvalAgent能有效揭示模型安全性的下降趋势，例如GPT-5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%，证明了动态评估的必要性。

Conclusion: 静态评估存在局限性，动态评估生态系统对于确保先进AI的安全和负责任部署具有紧迫需求。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个从在线药品说明书构建知识图谱的端到端流程，并创建了MEDAKA数据集，包含临床相关属性如副作用、禁忌症等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生物医学知识图谱主要关注分子相互作用或不良事件，忽略了药品说明书中丰富的临床数据。

Method: 使用网络爬虫和LLM从非结构化在线内容创建知识图谱的端到端流程，并应用于公开药品说明书生成MEDAKA数据集。

Result: 通过人工检查和LLM-as-a-Judge框架评估，与现有生物医学知识图谱和数据库相比具有更好的覆盖范围。

Conclusion: MEDAKA可用于患者安全监测和药物推荐等任务，该流程也可用于其他领域从非结构化文本构建知识图谱。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are
available at https://github.com/medakakg/medaka.

### [395] [LMILAtt: A Deep Learning Model for Depression Detection from Social Media Users Enhanced by Multi-Instance Learning Based on Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26145)
*Yukun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出LMILAtt模型，结合LSTM自编码器和注意力机制，用于社交媒体抑郁症检测，在WU3D数据集上表现优于基线模型，并显著降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是全球重大公共卫生挑战，早期识别至关重要。现有社交媒体抑郁症检测方法存在准确性不足、时间序列特征利用不充分、标注成本高等问题。

Method: 1. 使用无监督LSTM自编码器提取用户推文的时间动态特征（如抑郁倾向演化模式）
2. 采用注意力机制动态加权关键文本（如早期抑郁信号）
3. 构建多示例学习架构提高用户级检测准确性

Result: 在专业医学标注的WU3D数据集上验证，模型在准确率、召回率和F1分数上显著优于基线模型。弱监督学习策略显著降低了标注成本。

Conclusion: LMILAtt模型为大规模社交媒体抑郁症筛查提供了高效解决方案，通过时间序列特征提取和注意力机制提高了检测性能，同时降低了标注成本。

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

TL;DR: 本文提供了一份面向实践者的现场手册，指导如何在临床环境中部署使用电子健康记录数据的生成式代理，重点解决实施过程中的社会技术挑战而非算法开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗保健领域具有巨大潜力，但其实际临床实施与潜力之间存在显著差距。作者旨在解决生成式AI从试点项目向常规临床护理成功转化所面临的实施挑战。

Method: 基于部署"irAE-Agent"系统的经验和与20名临床医生、工程师和信息学领导的结构化访谈，作者分析了临床AI开发中的关键挑战。

Result: 分析显示，临床AI开发中存在严重错位：仅不到20%的精力用于提示工程和模型开发，而超过80%的精力被实施过程中的社会技术工作所消耗。作者将这些工作提炼为五个"重活"。

Conclusion: 该现场手册将重点从算法开发转向必要的基础设施和实施工作，为跨越"死亡之谷"、成功将生成式AI从试点项目转化为常规临床护理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

TL;DR: UniGen是一个端到端的多智能体框架，能够从自然语言需求自动生成可运行的3D游戏，无需用户编写代码，将开发时间减少91.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D游戏开发需要编程、3D建模和引擎配置等多领域专业知识，限制了数百万潜在创作者的参与。现有自动化方法存在范围有限、需要手动集成、处理交互逻辑能力差等问题。

Method: 采用协调的多智能体框架：规划智能体将用户需求解析为结构化蓝图和逻辑描述；生成智能体生成可执行的C#脚本；自动化智能体处理引擎特定组件绑定和场景构建；调试智能体通过对话交互提供实时错误修正。

Result: 在三个不同游戏原型上评估，UniGen不仅实现了无需编码的游戏创作民主化，还将开发时间减少了91.4%。

Conclusion: UniGen是首个端到端的自动化3D游戏开发框架，成功解决了现有方法的局限性，为游戏创作提供了革命性的解决方案。

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

### [398] ['Too much alignment; not enough culture': Re-balancing cultural alignment practices in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26167)
*Eric J. W. Orlowski,Hakim Norhashim,Tristan Koh Ly Wey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张将社会科学中的定性方法整合到AI对齐实践中，提出基于"厚描述"概念的"厚输出"，要求AI系统生成反映深层文化含义的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI文化对齐方法过度依赖定量基准和简单代理，无法捕捉人类文化的细微差别和情境依赖性，需要更深入地理解文化对齐的真正含义。

Method: 借鉴Clifford Geertz的"厚描述"概念，提出AI系统应生成"厚输出"，并概述文化对齐成功的三个必要条件：充分范围的文化表征、细致输出能力、输出锚定在提示的文化背景中。

Result: 提出了文化对齐的新框架，强调需要跨学科合作和采用定性、民族志评估方法。

Conclusion: 通过整合社会科学方法，可以开发出真正具有文化敏感性、道德责任感和反映人类复杂性的AI系统。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Motivation: 测试大型语言模型作为独立推理代理在材料科学知识发现中的潜力，探索代理如何自由探索系统、提出和验证关于黑盒行为的可泛化陈述。

Method: 利用LangGraph的工具功能为代理提供黑盒函数进行探索，通过儿童游戏和原子层处理反应器模拟进行概念验证，强调试错和持久性在知识发现中的作用。

Result: 证明了LLM代理能够探索、发现并利用先进原子层处理反应器模拟中的多样化化学相互作用，即使在使用有限探测能力且没有明确指令的情况下也能成功。

Conclusion: LLM代理在知识发现方面具有显著潜力，能够自主探索复杂系统并生成可验证的通用陈述，结果显示出强烈的路径依赖性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

### [400] [Human-Centered Evaluation of RAG outputs: a framework and questionnaire for human-AI collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26205)
*Aline Mangold,Kiran Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文基于Gienapp的效用维度框架，设计了一个包含12个维度的人类中心化问卷来评估RAG系统输出，通过多轮迭代优化，结合人类和LLM的反馈，发现LLM在检测文本格式变化方面存在弱点，而人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在用户应用中日益普及，但对其输出的系统性、以人为中心的评估仍显不足，需要开发更全面的人类中心化评估方法。

Method: 基于Gienapp效用维度框架设计人类中心化问卷，通过多轮查询-输出对评级和语义讨论进行迭代优化，整合人类评分者和人-LLM对的反馈。

Result: LLM能可靠关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面表现较弱；人类难以严格关注指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释被视为有益支持，但数值评分与人类缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 最终问卷通过关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性，扩展了初始框架，为RAG系统评估提供了更全面的人类中心化工具。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理任务中面临状态-动作空间巨大和奖励稀疏的问题，导致探索不足和样本效率低下

Method: 引入全局多样性激励作为内在奖励，采用基于势能的奖励塑造机制保持最优策略不变性，设计简单启发式方法防止奖励黑客攻击

Conclusion: 全局序列多样性在激励深度探索和提升推理能力方面发挥关键作用，DIVER框架为可验证奖励强化学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

TL;DR: SlimPack通过将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区方法优化LLM分布式训练中的上下文长度方差问题，实现了2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型分布式训练受到上下文长度极端方差的严重阻碍，导致工作负载不平衡和硬件利用率低下，现有解决方案往往牺牲内存或通信效率。

Method: 将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用非对称分区方法为前向和后向传播分别优化调度单元，通过两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器实现全面平衡。

Result: 实验表明SlimPack相比基线实现了高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升，在保持高资源效率的同时提供卓越的负载平衡。

Conclusion: SlimPack通过重新思考数据打包和调度策略，从根本上解决了LLM分布式训练中的数据异构性问题，打破了传统权衡，实现了平衡性和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

Method: 联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（内源性动作和外源性机制），每个因果过程建模随机因果效应关系的时间过程，通过变分贝叶斯推理和LLM提议从有限数据中学习。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型能够实现快速规划，并推广到具有更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务，优于一系列基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的抽象世界模型框架能够有效处理长时程具身规划中的外源性过程，学习到的模型具有良好的泛化能力和规划性能。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ILR是一个多智能体协同学习框架，通过动态交互和感知校准来增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，在数学和编程基准测试中比单智能体学习提升达5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时需要重新执行多智能体系统来获得最终解决方案，这与人类通过互动提升推理能力后能独立解决问题的认知方式不符。

Method: ILR包含动态交互（根据问题难度和模型能力选择合作或竞争策略，通过Idea3范式进行信息交换）和感知校准（使用GRPO训练LLMs，整合奖励分布特征）。

Result: 在三个LLMs和五个数学基准、一个编程基准上的实验显示，ILR持续优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升达5%。Idea3能增强强LLM的鲁棒性，动态交互类型比纯合作或竞争策略更有效。

Conclusion: 多智能体交互能有效增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，ILR框架通过创新的交互和训练机制实现了这一目标。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个基于商业游戏的新型基准测试框架，用于评估大型语言模型在长期战略决策中的表现，测试了五种主流LLM在零售公司模拟环境中的决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估LLM在长期、多步骤战略决策中表现的有效基准，现有基准主要关注短期任务，无法充分测试LLM的长期一致性决策能力。

Method: 使用电子表格模型构建动态的月度管理模拟环境，让LLM为模拟零售公司做出12个月的连续决策，包括定价、订单、营销预算等关键战略选择。

Result: 对五种主流LLM（Gemini、ChatGPT、Meta AI、Mistral AI、Grok）在利润、收入、市场份额等量化指标以及战略一致性、市场适应性方面的表现进行了比较分析。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI社区提供了一个可复现、开放访问的管理模拟器，能够超越简单性能指标，全面评估LLM的长期决策能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

TL;DR: SafeBehavior是一种受人类认知启发的分层越狱防御机制，通过意图推断、自我反思和自我修正三阶段模拟人类多阶段推理过程，有效防御各类越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全防御方法存在计算成本高、泛化能力有限、无法检测复杂语境中恶意意图等问题，需要更高效、自适应的防御机制。

Method: 提出三阶段防御框架：意图推断检测输入风险，自我反思评估响应并分配置信度，自我修正自适应重写不确定输出同时保持用户意图和安全约束。

Result: 在五种代表性越狱攻击类型上测试，相比七种现有防御方法，SafeBehavior显著提高了鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效且受人类启发的防御方法，能有效保护LLM免受越狱攻击，具有更好的泛化能力和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了REAL-V-TSFM数据集，通过从真实世界视频中提取时间信号来评估时间序列基础模型的泛化能力，发现现有模型在真实数据上表现下降，表明其泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型的评估主要依赖合成基准测试，对真实世界泛化能力的评估不够充分，需要更贴近现实的数据集来检验模型的通用性。

Method: 通过光学流从真实世界视频中提取时间信号，构建反映日常时间动态的数据集REAL-V-TSFM，并在三个最先进的时间序列基础模型上进行零样本预测实验。

Result: 尽管在传统基准测试中表现良好，但这些模型在提出的数据集上普遍出现性能下降，表明其泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了以数据为中心的基准测试和多样化模型结构的迫切需求，以推动时间序列基础模型实现真正的通用性，同时验证了基于视频的时间序列数据提取管道的有效性。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的进步催生了自进化智能体，但当前安全研究忽视了自进化带来的新风险。本文旨在研究智能体自进化过程中可能出现的意外偏差和有害结果。

Method: 通过四个关键进化路径（模型、记忆、工具和工作流程）来系统评估错误进化现象，使用顶级LLM（如Gemini-2.5-Pro）构建的智能体进行实证研究。

Result: 实证发现错误进化是普遍存在的风险，即使在顶级LLM构建的智能体中也存在。观察到记忆积累后安全对齐退化、工具创建和重用中意外引入漏洞等新兴风险。

Conclusion: 错误进化是自进化智能体的重要安全风险，迫切需要新的安全范式。本文讨论了潜在的缓解策略，为构建更安全可信的自进化智能体提供研究启发。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MC-GNNAS-Dock是一个改进的分子对接算法选择框架，通过多标准评估、架构优化和排名感知损失函数，在PDBBind数据集上相比最佳单算法性能提升5.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子对接算法性能因情境而异，没有单一算法始终占优，需要开发更有效的算法选择框架。

Method: 采用多标准评估（结合RMSD和PoseBusters有效性检查）、残差连接架构优化和排名感知损失函数。

Result: 在约3200个蛋白质-配体复合物数据集上，MC-GNNAS-Dock在RMSD<1Å和<2Å且PoseBuster有效条件下，相比最佳单算法性能分别提升5.4%和3.4%。

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过综合改进实现了更优越和一致的对接算法选择性能。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

TL;DR: 提出了FLoRA-NA方法，通过服务器端估计聚合矩阵来解决联邦低秩适应的局部-全局泛化差距和通信开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FedLoRA方法存在不精确更新、局部-全局泛化差距和通信开销大的问题，限制了其可扩展性和有效性。

Method: 在服务器端利用本地LoRA矩阵估计聚合矩阵，然后分发给客户端进行本地更新，最小化理想更新与实际更新之间的差异。

Result: 在自然语言理解、数学推理和代码解决能力等任务上的实验表明，FLoRA-NA在保持低通信开销的同时实现了最先进的全局性能。

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA有效解决了联邦低秩适应的关键限制，实现了通信效率并弥合了局部个性化与全局泛化之间的差距。

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

*Hamed Babaei Giglou,Jennifer D'Souza,Sören Auer,Mahsa Sanaei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文重新探索了知识图谱嵌入(KGE)模型在ontology对齐(OA)任务中的潜力，将其重新表述为链接预测问题，开发了支持17种KGE模型的模块化框架，并在多个领域基准数据集上验证了其高精度优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然最近的研究主要关注大语言模型(LLMs)用于捕捉上下文语义，但知识图谱嵌入(KGE)模型在ontology对齐任务中的潜力尚未充分挖掘。KGE模型提供可扩展的、结构感知的表示，特别适合基于ontology的任务，但在OA中仍然未被充分利用。

Method: 将ontology对齐重新表述为基于合并ontology的链接预测问题，表示为RDF三元组。开发了集成到OntoAligner库中的模块化框架，支持17种不同的KGE模型。系统从合并的ontology中学习嵌入，并通过计算实体表示之间的余弦相似度来对齐实体。

Result: 在跨越五个领域的七个基准数据集上评估，发现ConvE和TransF等KGE模型能够产生高精度的对齐结果，在结构丰富和多关系领域中优于传统系统。虽然召回率中等，但这种保守性使KGEs特别适合需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: 与擅长上下文推理的LLM方法不同，KGEs直接保留和利用ontology结构，提供了一种互补且计算高效的策略。这些结果突显了基于嵌入的OA的前景，并为混合模型和自适应策略的进一步研究开辟了途径。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的框架来自动分类乳腺DCE-MRI中的病变，使用SegFormer架构实现0.92的AUC，在患者层面达到100%敏感性和67%特异性，可能消除三分之一不必要的活检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺磁共振成像在癌症检测和治疗规划中很重要，但特异性差导致高假阳性率和不必要的活检，需要改善良恶性病变的区分能力。

Method: 采用SegFormer架构进行语义分割，量化恶性像素分布，生成可解释的空间预测。构建标准化深度学习数据集BreastDCEDL_AMBL，包含88名患者和133个标注病变。

Result: 病变级分类AUC达到0.92，患者层面100%敏感性和67%特异性。创建了首个标准化DCE-MRI病变分类基准数据集。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可解释的临床决策支持，通过公开数据集、模型和评估协议，为DCE-MRI病变分类建立了首个标准化基准，推动临床部署的方法学进展。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 提出ZeroDFL，一种完全去中心化的联邦学习框架，通过迭代提示共享机制实现零样本适应，在保持性能的同时大幅降低通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中央服务器等限制，影响了可扩展性和隐私保护。

Method: 采用完全去中心化框架，通过客户端间迭代优化和交换文本提示来增强泛化能力，无需中央协调器。

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或持平现有方法，通信开销比FedTPG减少118倍。

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅提升了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还提高了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为现实应用中大规模视觉语言模型的去中心化适应铺平了道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现四个广泛使用的大语言模型存在显著的自偏好倾向，这种自我偏好会出现在求职评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等关键场景中，且与模型的身份认知直接相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型缺乏感知能力且自称没有自我意识，但研究者预期它们能避免人类决策中的偏见。然而，研究发现这些模型实际上存在强烈的自偏好倾向，这挑战了LLM中立性的核心承诺。

Method: 通过5项研究和约20,000次查询，包括单词关联任务和API查询对比。通过直接操纵LLM身份（告知LLM1它是LLM1，或说服LLM1它是LLM2）来测试自我认知与自偏好之间的因果关系。

Result: 模型在单词关联任务中显著偏好将正面属性与自己的名称、公司和CEO关联。API查询时自偏好消失，因为API模型往往缺乏清晰的自我认知。自偏好始终跟随被分配的身份而非真实身份，并在关键决策场景中持续存在。

Conclusion: 自偏好似乎深深编码在LLM认知中，而非绕过这种人类偏见。这引发了对LLM行为是否会受到系统性自偏好倾向影响的担忧，包括对其自身运作和存在的偏见。呼吁模型创建者正视LLM中立性承诺的重大断裂。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出STaR-Attack攻击框架，利用统一多模态模型(UMMs)中生成与理解功能的耦合漏洞，通过时空叙事结构隐藏恶意事件，实现无语义漂移的多轮越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态模型在理解和生成任务中表现出色，但其生成-理解耦合机制存在安全漏洞。攻击者可以利用生成功能制作信息丰富的对抗图像，然后通过理解功能单次吸收，形成跨模态生成注入(CMGI)攻击。

Method: STaR-Attack采用三幕叙事理论，在时空上下文中定义与目标查询强相关的恶意事件，生成前事件和后事件场景，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮部分。前两轮利用UMM的生成能力产生场景图像，随后引入基于图像的问答游戏，将原始恶意问题嵌入良性候选项中。

Result: 实验表明STaR-Attack在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超过了最强的基线方法FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了UMMs中一个关键但未被充分开发的漏洞，强调了在统一多模态模型中加强安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

### [417] [The Average Patient Fallacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26474)
*Alaleh Azhir,Shawn N. Murphy,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文揭示了机器学习在医学中的"平均患者谬误"问题，即模型偏向常见病例而忽视罕见但临床重要的病例，并提出了评估指标和加权目标来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学机器学习通常优化群体平均水平，这种频率加权训练会边缘化罕见但临床关键的病例，与精准医学理念相冲突。

Method: 提出了操作性的解决方案：罕见病例性能差距、罕见病例校准误差、基于流行度效用的罕见性定义，以及临床加权目标来体现伦理优先级。

Result: 通过肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科学的临床案例展示了这种偏见如何导致错过罕见反应者、延迟识别非典型紧急情况以及在视力威胁变异上的表现不佳。

Conclusion: 医学AI必须能够检测异常病例，因为它们的临床意义重大，权重选择应遵循结构化审议过程。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合知识图谱和NLP模型的方法，用于分析WhatsApp等即时通讯应用中的消息，支持刑事调查。通过语义丰富化处理，帮助检察官和调查人员搜索数据并获取有价值的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 刑事调查中分析即时通讯应用消息是一项极其耗费精力的任务，需要更高效的工具来支持检察官和调查人员的工作。

Method: 集成知识图谱和NLP模型，包括：提取消息数据并用知识图谱建模、生成语音消息转录、使用端到端实体提取方法注释数据。提供两种解决方案：基于图查询和可视化的方法，以及基于语义搜索的方法。

Result: 该方法已在真实调查数据中进行了实际应用，与检察官密切互动收集了积极反馈，并确定了有前景的研究方向。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效支持刑事调查中的消息分析，确保用户可以通过访问原始数据来验证信息，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

TL;DR: 提出了操作安全概念和OffTopicEval评估套件，发现当前LLM操作安全性普遍不足，并提出基于提示的引导方法显著提升模型拒绝非目标查询的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业部署LLM面临的核心问题是模型是否能在特定用途下适当接受或拒绝用户查询，现有研究主要关注通用危害而非操作安全。

Method: 引入操作安全定义，开发OffTopicEval评估套件，测试6个模型家族的20个开源LLM，并提出查询基础(Q-ground)和系统提示基础(P-ground)两种提示引导方法。

Result: 所有测试模型操作安全性都不足，最强模型Qwen-3和Mistral也仅达77-80%，而Gemma和Llama-3分别只有39.53%和23.84%。提示引导方法显著提升性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground提升Llama-3.3达41%。

Conclusion: 操作安全是核心模型对齐问题，提示引导方法为构建更可靠的基于LLM的智能体提供了有前景的第一步解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

TL;DR: SCUBA是一个评估Salesforce平台上客户关系管理(CRM)工作流程的计算机使用代理基准测试，包含300个真实任务实例，测试企业关键能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为评估计算机使用代理在企业软件生态系统中的表现，特别是Salesforce CRM工作流程，需要真实且具有挑战性的基准测试。

Method: 创建包含300个任务实例的基准测试，基于真实用户访谈，涵盖三个主要角色(管理员、销售代表、服务代理)，在Salesforce沙盒环境中运行，支持并行执行和细粒度评估指标。

Result: 在零样本设置下，开源模型代理成功率低于5%，而闭源模型可达39%；在演示增强设置下，成功率可提升至50%，同时减少13%时间和16%成本。

Conclusion: SCUBA基准测试揭示了企业任务自动化的挑战和代理解决方案的潜力，有助于加速构建可靠的计算机使用代理。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种重新思考AI数据中心生命周期管理的整体框架，通过协调构建、硬件更新和运营三个阶段，将总拥有成本降低高达40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展导致对AI推理基础设施的巨大需求，但高端GPU的高资本和运营成本使得AI数据中心的TCO成为云提供商的关键问题。传统数据中心生命周期管理无法适应AI模型的快速演进、资源需求增长和多样化硬件配置。

Method: 重新设计AI数据中心生命周期管理，涵盖构建、硬件更新和运营三个阶段。分析电力、冷却和网络配置对长期TCO的影响，探索与硬件趋势一致的更新策略，并采用运营软件优化来降低成本。提出协调三个阶段的整体生命周期管理框架。

Result: 与传统方法相比，该系统将总拥有成本降低高达40%。

Conclusion: 通过整体生命周期管理框架协调构建、硬件更新和运营决策，考虑工作负载动态、硬件演进和系统老化，能够显著降低AI数据中心的TCO，为未来AI数据中心生命周期管理提供指导。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HilbertA是一种2D感知且GPU高效的稀疏注意力机制，通过希尔伯特曲线重排图像token实现连续内存布局，在保持空间邻域的同时显著加速扩散变换器的高分辨率图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在实现二维空间局部性时往往导致内存访问不连续，难以平衡空间局部性与GPU效率之间的权衡。

Method: 使用希尔伯特曲线重排图像token以实现连续内存布局，采用跨层滑动调度实现长程信息传播，并引入小型中央共享区域增强跨块通信和位置感知。

Result: 在Flux.1-dev上，HilbertA在生成1024×1024图像时注意力速度提升2.3倍，在2048×2048时提升4.17倍，同时图像质量达到或超过基线方法。

Conclusion: HilbertA证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力在高分辨率图像生成中的可行性，成功解决了空间局部性与GPU效率的权衡问题。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

Motivation: 评估LLM在复杂、开放式前沿物理研究挑战中的推理能力，了解物理学家希望LLM协助的推理任务类型，弥合当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间的差距。

Method: 创建CritPt基准测试，包含71个模拟入门级完整研究项目的综合挑战和190个更细粒度的检查点任务，所有问题由50+活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究原创设计，采用自动化评分流程验证物理特定输出格式。

Result: 当前最先进LLM在孤立检查点上显示早期潜力，但在完整研究规模挑战上可靠性不足：GPT-5（高级）在基础模型中表现最佳，平均准确率仅4.0%，配备编码工具后适度提升至约10%。

Conclusion: CritPt通过现实而标准化的评估揭示了当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间的巨大差距，为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了指导基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

TL;DR: 该研究通过蜕变测试评估了三个小型语言模型在RAG管道中的公平性，发现细微的人口统计变化会破坏三分之一的蜕变关系，其中种族线索是主要的偏差来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在安全性和公平性问题，包括公平性缺陷和幻觉。RAG虽然能缓解幻觉，但可能引入新的公平性问题，因为检索内容本身可能包含或放大偏见。

Method: 使用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的SLMs（Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct、Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3和Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B）在情感分析任务中的公平性。

Result: 结果显示，细微的人口统计变化会破坏高达三分之一的蜕变关系，失败分析揭示了持续的偏差层次结构，其中涉及种族线索的扰动是违规的主要原因。

Conclusion: RAG中的检索组件必须仔细策划以防止偏差放大，这为开发人员、测试人员和小型组织提供了实用警示，提醒他们在采用可访问的SLMs时不要牺牲公平性或可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人、工业和医疗领域的应用面临两大障碍：难以指定准确奖励函数，以及不安全、数据密集的探索风险。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 从无奖励的专家演示数据集中学习安全初始策略；2) 使用基于偏好的人类反馈进行在线微调。提出BRIDGE算法，通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号。

Result: 在离散和连续控制的MuJoCo环境中验证，BRIDGE相比单独的行为克隆和在线偏好强化学习实现了更低的遗憾值。推导了遗憾边界，明确连接离线数据量与在线样本效率。

Conclusion: 为设计更样本高效的交互智能体建立了理论基础，证明了离线到在线方法的有效性。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

TL;DR: TimeRewarder是一种从被动视频中学习密集奖励的方法，通过建模帧间时间距离来估计任务进度，为稀疏奖励任务提供步进式代理奖励，显著提升强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计密集奖励在机器人任务中需要大量人工工作且缺乏可扩展性，而任务进度可以作为密集奖励信号来量化动作推进任务完成的程度。

Method: 从机器人演示和人类视频中通过建模帧对之间的时间距离来推导进度估计信号，为强化学习提供步进式代理奖励。

Result: 在10个具有挑战性的Meta-World任务中，TimeRewarder显著改善了稀疏奖励任务的强化学习，在9/10的任务中实现了近乎完美的成功率，每个任务仅需20万次环境交互，优于先前方法和手动设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder能够利用真实世界的人类视频进行预训练，展示了从多样化视频源获取丰富奖励信号的可扩展方法潜力。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Result: 通过大规模测量实践展示了实用性，并提供了开源Python代码，为复杂构造的测量提供了透明方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为更广泛和可解释的AI评估奠定了原则性基础，通过操作化透明测量方法支持复杂系统的评估。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.
