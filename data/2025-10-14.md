### [1] [MCE: Towards a General Framework for Handling Missing Modalities under Imbalanced Missing Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10534)
*Binyu Zhao,Wei Zhang,Zhaonian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE)方法来解决多模态学习中缺失模态的问题，特别是处理不平衡缺失率的情况。MCE包含两个组件：学习能力增强(LCE)和表示能力增强(RCE)，在四个多模态基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习面临的主要挑战是处理缺失模态，特别是在不平衡缺失率下。这种不平衡会引发恶性循环：缺失率较高的模态更新较少，导致学习进度不一致和表示质量下降。现有方法通常关注全局数据集级平衡，忽略了样本级模态效用变化和特征质量下降问题。

Method: MCE方法包含两个协同组件：1) 学习能力增强(LCE)：引入多级因素动态平衡模态特定学习进度；2) 表示能力增强(RCE)：通过子集预测和跨模态补全任务提升特征语义和鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个多模态基准测试上的综合评估表明，MCE在各种缺失配置下始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MCE通过同时解决学习进度不平衡和表示质量下降问题，有效提升了多模态学习在缺失模态情况下的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The
journal preprint version is now available at

### [2] [Connecting Giants: Synergistic Knowledge Transfer of Large Multimodal Models for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11115)
*Hao Tang,Shengfeng He,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SynTrans框架，通过从大型多模态模型转移多样化互补知识来增强现成的少样本学习器，显著提升少样本分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法利用小规模模型的语义知识来解决少样本学习中的数据稀缺问题，但这些方法由于数据固有的简单性而引入噪声和偏差

Method: 使用CLIP作为强教师模型，少样本视觉编码器作为弱学生模型，通过无监督代理任务蒸馏语义对齐的视觉知识；包含训练自由的协同知识挖掘模块、视觉-语义桥接模块、视觉权重生成器和语义权重重构器

Result: 在四个少样本学习数据集上的实验结果表明，即使与简单的少样本视觉编码器配对，SynTrans也显著优于当前最先进的方法

Conclusion: SynTrans框架通过有效转移大型多模态模型的多样化互补知识，成功提升了少样本学习的性能

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

*Khartik Uppalapati,Bora Yimenicioglu,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Adan Eftekhari,Bhavya Uppalapati,Viraj Kamath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TinyViT-Batten框架，使用少量样本的Vision Transformer从儿科脑部MRI中检测早期Batten病，模型仅5M参数，在79例确诊患者和90例对照数据上达到约91%准确率和0.95以上AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batten病是一种罕见儿科神经退行性疾病，早期MRI征象细微且常被漏诊，需要开发能够从有限训练样本中检测早期疾病的AI解决方案。

Method: 将大型教师ViT蒸馏为5M参数的TinyViT，使用基于度量的少样本学习（原型损失，5-shot episodes）进行微调，并集成Grad-CAM实现可解释预测。

Result: 在多中心数据集上达到高准确率（约91%）和AUC（至少0.95），优于3D-ResNet和Swin-Tiny基线，灵敏度大于90%，特异性约90%。

Conclusion: 模型的小尺寸和强性能展示了用于早期Batten病检测的实用AI解决方案，通过Grad-CAM提供可解释的预测。

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

### [4] [CoPRS: Learning Positional Prior from Chain-of-Thought for Reasoning Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11173)
*Zhenyu Lu,Liupeng Li,Jinpeng Wang,Yan Feng,Bin Chen,Ke Chen,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPRS是一个基于多模态思维链的位置感知模型，通过可微分的热图将语言推理与分割任务连接起来，提高了可解释性和分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么直接将语言模型的隐藏特征连接到掩码解码器，要么在文本中表示位置，这限制了可解释性和语义细节。

Method: 使用可学习的集中令牌聚合图像和推理文本特征，生成可微分的位置先验热图，通过轻量级解码器解码为精确掩码。

Result: 在RefCOCO系列和ReasonSeg数据集上，CoPRS达到或超过了现有最佳性能指标，热图质量与掩码质量密切相关。

Conclusion: 该范式在连接推理和分割方面具有实用性，显示出由推理驱动的集中性和更精确的掩码预测优势。

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics
including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The
methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and
usability of TreeNet in the demanding landscape of medical image analysis
specially in the realtime analysis.

### [7] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Omni Swift Action Tokenizer (OmniSAT)，通过B样条编码和多阶段残差量化技术，将动作序列压缩6.8倍，降低目标熵，提升自回归模型的训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型在处理长序列和高维动作时存在压缩效率低或重建质量差的问题，需要一种更有效的动作表示方法。

Method: 采用B样条编码进行归一化，然后对位置、旋转和夹爪子空间进行多阶段残差量化，生成具有粗细粒度的离散令牌。

Result: 在Droid数据集上预训练后，序列长度缩短6.8倍，目标熵降低，训练收敛更快，模型性能提升。

Conclusion: OmniSAT实现了高效压缩同时保持重建质量，支持跨具身学习策略，在真实机器人和仿真实验中表现优异。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

### [8] [Knowledge-Aware Mamba for Joint Change Detection and Classification from MODIS Times Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09679)
*Zhengsen Xu,Yimin Zhu,Zack Dewis,Mabel Heffring,Motasem Alkayid,Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KAMamba的新方法，用于改进MODIS时间序列变化检测，通过知识驱动的过渡矩阵和多任务学习来解决混合像素、时空谱信息耦合等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MODIS时间序列变化检测面临混合像素、空间-光谱-时间信息耦合效应和背景类别异质性等关键困难，需要更有效的方法来应对这些挑战。

Method: 设计了知识驱动的过渡矩阵引导方法（KAT-loss）、多任务学习方法（PreC-loss、PostC-loss、Chg-loss）、空间-光谱-时间Mamba模块（SSTMamba）以及稀疏可变形Mamba骨干（SDMamba）。

Result: 在加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的MODIS时间序列数据集上，变化检测的平均F1分数比基线提高了约1.5-6%，LULC分类的OA、AA和Kappa指标提高了约2%。

Conclusion: KAMamba方法有效解决了MODIS变化检测中的关键挑战，在变化检测和土地覆盖分类任务上都取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

### [9] [NNDM: NN_UNet Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09681)
*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NNDM混合框架，结合NN-UNet和扩散模型，通过迭代去噪过程提升脑肿瘤MRI分割的边界精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN模型在脑肿瘤MRI分割中存在泛化能力不足、边界精度差和数据多样性有限的问题。

Method: 将NN-UNet的稳健特征提取与扩散概率模型的生成能力相结合，通过扩散模型学习预测掩码与真实掩码之间的残差分布，迭代细化分割结果。

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上，NNDM相比传统U-Net和基于transformer的基线方法，在Dice系数和Hausdorff距离指标上表现更优，且在多模态和肿瘤子区域上具有更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NNDM为结合确定性分割网络与随机扩散模型开辟了新方向，推进了自动化脑肿瘤分析的技术水平。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情具有极低强度且难以被肉眼察觉，但能揭示真实情绪，在谎言检测、行为分析和心理评估中具有重要价值。

Conclusion: 输入表示和所提架构都对提升微表情识别性能起重要作用，为情感计算、谎言检测和人机交互领域的进一步研究和实际应用提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

*Dwip Dalal,Gautam Vashishtha,Utkarsh Mishra,Jeonghwan Kim,Madhav Kanda,Hyeonjeong Ha,Svetlana Lazebnik,Heng Ji,Unnat Jain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp是一种轻量级方法，通过多模态大语言模型的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行线性扭曲，在不改变模型权重或架构的情况下，将空间分辨率重新分配到模型认为重要的区域，从而提升细粒度感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在复杂场景中经常错过小细节和空间关系，导致细粒度感知定位错误。需要一种方法能够在不改变模型结构的情况下提升模型对重要区域的关注度。

Method: 使用MLLM的跨模态注意力进行图像线性扭曲，将分辨率重新分配到查询相关的内容区域，同时压缩信息量较少的区域，保持全局上下文不变。

Result: 在五个基准测试（TextVQA、GQA、DocVQA、POPE、MMMU）和四个MLLM（LLaVA、Qwen-VL、InternVL、InstructBLIP）上，AttWarp持续提高准确性，增强组合推理能力，减少幻觉，优于四个竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: 注意力引导的扭曲能够优先处理与查询相关的信息同时保持上下文，相同的MLLM在接收这种扭曲输入时表现更好。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

TL;DR: 研究多模态环境下外语学习者通过图像-句子对推断陌生词汇含义的能力，分析影响推断成功的特征因素和AI系统在此任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索外语学习者在多模态情境（图像配句子）中推断陌生词汇含义的新学习方式，了解哪些数据特征和语言背景有助于成功推断。

Method: 通过人类参与者实验，使用不同的图像-文本对，分析图像和文本特征对推断陌生词汇的影响，以及参与者语言背景与成功率的关联。

Result: 发现只有部分直观特征与参与者表现有强相关性，需要进一步研究预测性特征；AI系统在推理参与者表现方面显示出改进潜力。

Conclusion: 多模态外语学习环境具有研究价值，但需要更深入探索预测性特征，AI系统在此类推理任务中有进一步改进的空间。

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应分辨率选择方法，通过分析图像复杂性和VLLM不确定性方差来确定最佳分辨率，并使用参数高效微调技术扩展预训练VLLM的视觉输入分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉大语言模型（VLLM）通常预设固定分辨率用于下游任务，导致性能不佳。现实世界视觉语言应用需要不同级别的感知粒度。

Method: 1. 调查不同视觉语言任务的分辨率偏好，发现分辨率偏好与图像复杂性和VLLM在不同分辨率下的不确定性方差相关；2. 提出经验公式结合这两个因素确定最佳分辨率；3. 使用参数高效微调技术扩展预训练VLLM的视觉输入分辨率。

Result: 在各种视觉语言任务上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过自适应分辨率选择和参数高效微调，可以显著提升VLLM在不同视觉语言任务上的性能。

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

TL;DR: 使用合成人脸数据增强单形态攻击检测(S-MAD)，通过增量测试协议评估合成数据对泛化能力的影响，发现适度使用合成数据可改善性能，但仅依赖合成数据会导致最差效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于隐私问题导致真实人脸图像大规模数据集可用性有限的问题，探索合成数据在形态攻击检测中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用多种形态工具和跨数据集评估方案，实施增量测试协议来评估随着合成图像增加时的泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过精心控制合成图像数量或逐步添加真实图像，可以改善泛化能力；但不加选择地使用合成数据会导致次优性能；仅使用合成数据时获得最高的等错误率(EER)。

Conclusion: 在操作场景中，最佳选择不应仅依赖合成数据进行S-MAD，需要谨慎控制合成数据的使用比例。

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ceb的新型细胞实例分割方法，通过利用细胞边界特征和标签来将前景像素划分为细胞实例，相比现有像素聚类方法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于深度学习的细胞实例分割方法通常将实例信息分解为像素级目标，但这种方法可能会丢失细胞实例的重要几何特性（如形状、曲率和凸性），这些特性需要像素集合才能表示。

Method: Ceb方法首先从语义分割生成的概率图中提取潜在的前景-前景边界，然后为每个边界候选构建边界特征表示（边界签名），使用边界分类器预测其二元边界标签，最后基于预测的边界标签通过分割或合并相邻区域获得细胞实例。

Result: 在六个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Ceb在语义分割概率图上优于现有的像素聚类方法，并且与最先进的细胞实例分割方法相比具有高度竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Ceb方法通过利用细胞边界特征有效解决了像素级目标可能丢失几何特性的问题，在细胞实例分割任务中取得了优异的表现。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning (CAPEL)框架，通过在分类logits空间进行集成而不是特征空间平均，解决了传统提示集成方法导致类别中心偏移的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统提示集成方法在特征空间平均文本特征会导致类别中心偏离真实分布，影响零样本迁移性能。

Method: CAPEL框架将图像分类到多个类别簇中，每个簇由不同提示表示；在logits空间进行集成；引入簇保持正则化项；采用自适应提示权重技术。

Result: 该方法能更好地对齐视觉特征分布，保持提示的簇特性和判别能力，提升跨数据集和任务的鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: CAPEL通过簇感知的提示集成学习，有效解决了传统提示集成方法的局限性，在保持提示多样性的同时提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多目标跟踪方法，使用自监督编码器融合深度和掩码特征来生成稳定的对象表示，替代传统的分割IoU计算，在复杂场景中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOT方法依赖IoU进行关联，但在对象相似或被遮挡时不可靠，且计算分割掩码IoU计算成本高。

Method: 融合深度和掩码特征，通过自监督训练的紧凑编码器生成对象表示，结合边界框IoU和重识别特征进行匹配，使用零样本深度估计器和提示式视觉分割模型获取空间线索。

Result: 在SportsMOT和DanceTrack等复杂基准测试中优于现有TBD方法，在MOT17等简单基准测试中达到竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该方法首次使用自监督编码器改进分割掩码而不计算掩码IoU，在计算效率和跟踪性能方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

Motivation: 现有HDR视频质量评估数据集主要关注专业生成内容，缺乏对真实世界用户生成HDR视频中特有退化问题的理解。

Method: 构建包含856个UGC-HDR源视频的数据集，通过多种分辨率和比特率转码模拟真实场景，在Amazon Mechanical Turk上进行大规模主观质量评估。

Result: 创建了包含5,992个视频和211,848个评分的CHUG数据集，为分析UGC-HDR视频特有失真提供了基准。

Conclusion: CHUG数据集将推动无参考HDR视频质量评估研究，提供了一个大规模、多样化且真实世界的UGC数据集。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景通常具有不规则布局和变化复杂度，包含杂乱、遮挡和平坦墙面。需要最大化有限资源的利用率，以提升沉浸式体验的生成质量。

Method: 在估计的几何支架上记录观测统计数据，指导基函数的最优放置，并提出场景自适应虚拟视点来补偿输入轨迹中视图配置的几何缺陷。

Result: 在多个大规模室内场景中进行了综合分析和讨论，相比采用规则放置的基线方法，在渲染质量和内存需求方面都显示出显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于几何先验的场景自适应策略能够有效提升神经辐射场表示在室内环境重建中的性能，特别是在处理不规则布局和复杂场景时表现出色。

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决日常环境中因场景频繁变化导致的稀疏捕获挑战，传统方法需要密集的空间和时间观测，难以处理非结构化、稀疏的日常捕获数据。

Method: 将对象建模为模板高斯，作为共享对象轨迹的结构化可重用先验；通过少样本观察对模板进行细化调整以适应时变环境；通过简单变换实现跨时间步的泛化。

Result: 相比其他基线方法获得更优的重建质量，同时支持快速轻量级更新；在真实世界数据集上验证了方法的实用性。

Conclusion: LTGS框架能够有效处理日常环境的长期变化，从稀疏捕获中构建高质量的场景时序表示，显著提升了3D环境时序演化的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视角姿态估计方法在有限标注数据下难以实现准确跟踪，且不确定性估计效果不佳，需要解决这些挑战来支持动物行为科学研究。

Method: 使用多视角变换器(MVT)同时处理所有视角信息，采用补丁掩码方案学习跨视角对应关系；对于标定设置，通过3D增强和三角化损失引入几何一致性；扩展非线性集成卡尔曼平滑器(EKS)并增强不确定性量化；设计蒸馏过程利用改进的EKS预测生成高质量伪标签。

Conclusion: 开发了一个实用的、不确定性感知的系统，能够在真实世界数据约束下实现可靠姿态估计，支持下游行为分析。

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HeadsUp模型，这是一个单步扩散模型，专门用于肖像图像超分辨率，能够端到端地无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，避免传统混合方法产生的边界伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像超分辨率技术要么专注于通用真实世界图像，要么专注于严格对齐的人脸图像。在实践中，处理肖像照片需要混合不同模型：人脸专家模型处理人脸区域，通用模型处理其他部分，但这会因不同模型训练方法而引入混合或边界伪影，而人类感知对人脸保真度特别敏感。

Method: 在单步扩散模型基础上构建，开发了人脸监督机制来引导模型关注面部区域，集成基于参考的机制来帮助身份恢复，减少低质量人脸恢复中的模糊性，并构建了高质量4K肖像图像超分辨率数据集PortraitSR-4K。

Result: 广泛实验表明，HeadsUp在肖像图像超分辨率任务上实现了最先进的性能，同时在通用图像和对齐人脸数据集上保持相当或更高的性能。

Conclusion: HeadsUp通过端到端的单步扩散模型成功解决了肖像图像超分辨率问题，避免了传统混合方法产生的边界伪影，在保持人脸保真度方面表现出色。

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

Conclusion: 通过扩散模型和Controlnet的结合，可以有效克服现有水下图像数据集的局限性，推动海洋环境监测研究的发展。

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脑在整个生命周期中经历动态的结构变化，纵向MRI数据对于表征典型和非典型衰老轨迹很有价值。但由于数据在个体内和群体间的空间和时间采样模式不同，传统深度学习方法难以表示潜在的连续生物过程。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示(INR)将受试者特定的纵向T1加权MRI数据建模为连续函数，设计了能够部分解耦空间和时间轨迹参数的新型INR架构，并开发了直接在INR参数空间上操作的分类框架。

Result: 在更现实的不规则采样实验中，基于INR的方法在脑衰老轨迹分类任务中达到81.3%的准确率，优于标准深度学习基线模型(73.7%)。

Conclusion: INR方法能够有效处理纵向神经影像数据的不规则采样问题，为脑衰老轨迹分析提供了更准确的建模框架。

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

TL;DR: 提出了一种人机交互干预学习框架，通过人类对分割结果的针对性修正来引导模型学习鲁棒的语义特征，而非依赖虚假相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型在基准测试中表现良好，但在实际应用中容易依赖虚假相关性而非真实的物体边界，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 将人类修正作为干预信号，通过传播修正信息到视觉相似的图像中，系统性地纠正模型的失败模式，引导模型学习语义上有意义的特征。

Result: 在挑战性的立方体地图数据上分割准确率提升高达9 mIoU点（12-15%相对改进），标注工作量减少3-4倍，同时在基准数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人员和从业者提供了一种实用的方法，能够构建准确、鲁棒、数据高效且适应现实世界领域的分割系统。

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

TL;DR: 提出J-RAS方法，通过联合训练分割模型和检索模型，利用检索到的图像-掩码对增强分割性能，在多个数据集和架构上显著提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中标注数据稀缺、泛化能力差的问题，传统AI方法需要大量标注数据且难以适应不同成像条件和罕见病例。

Method: 联合训练分割模型和检索模型，分割模型利用检索到的图像-掩码对增强解剖学理解，检索模型学习分割相关的特征，超越简单的视觉相似性。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上，SegFormer结合J-RAS将Dice分数从0.8708提升到0.9115，Hausdorff距离从1.8130降低到1.1489，在多个架构和数据集上均显示一致改进。

Conclusion: J-RAS方法通过联合优化有效提升了分割性能，具有良好的通用性和架构适应性。

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通传感器部署成本高、维护困难，而现有视频分析技术难以处理大规模摄像头网络的动态视角和海量数据，需要开发成本效益高、可扩展的交通监控解决方案。

Method: 使用在本地城市场景微调的YOLOv11模型实时提取多模态交通密度和分类指标；提出图基视角归一化方法处理非固定PTZ摄像头的不一致性；集成领域特定大语言模型处理24/7视频流数据生成自动化交通模式摘要。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了作为实用、基础设施就绪的解决方案的潜力，能够以最少人工干预进行大规模、政策相关的交通监控。

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理原理的镜头光晕数据生成方法FlareX，包含参数化模板创建、光照感知的2D合成和基于物理引擎的3D渲染三个阶段，解决了现有合成数据缺乏多样性和物理真实性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有镜头光晕数据集通常通过将人工光晕模板叠加到背景图像上来合成，但模板缺乏多样性且忽略物理原理，导致训练模型难以泛化到真实场景。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 参数化模板创建；2) 光照感知的2D合成；3) 物理引擎驱动的3D渲染，最终生成包含2D和3D视角的混合数据集FlareX。

Result: 构建了FlareX数据集，包含从95种光晕模式衍生的9,500个2D模板和从60个3D场景渲染的3,000对光晕图像对，并设计了掩码方法从受损图像获取真实世界无光晕图像。

Conclusion: 大量实验证明了所提方法和数据集的有效性，能够更好地泛化到真实世界场景。

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了BurstDeflicker数据集，通过三种互补的数据采集策略解决闪烁伪影问题：基于Retinex的合成方法、真实场景采集和绿幕方法，有效提升闪烁去除研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滚动快门相机与交流电照明之间的相互作用导致短曝光图像中出现闪烁伪影，表现为不均匀亮度分布和暗带。这种结构化噪声不仅影响图像质量，还影响目标检测和跟踪等高级任务。缺乏大规模真实数据集阻碍了闪烁去除研究的进展。

Method: 1. 开发基于Retinex的合成流水线，可控制关键闪烁属性（强度、区域、频率）的操纵；2. 从不同场景采集4000张真实世界闪烁图像；3. 提出绿幕方法，在保持真实闪烁退化的同时将运动纳入图像对。

Result: 综合实验证明了数据集的有效性及其在推动闪烁去除研究方面的潜力。

Conclusion: BurstDeflicker数据集通过三种互补的数据采集策略，为闪烁去除研究提供了可扩展的基准，有助于模型更好地理解真实闪烁伪影的时空特性，并更有效地泛化到野外场景。

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型仅依赖文本指令，缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解；仅给出文本答案，缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。

Method: 提出MIMO模型，具有视觉参考的多模态输入和像素定位的多模态输出能力。构建MIMOSeg数据集（89.5万样本），从四个不同角度覆盖基础指令跟随和复杂问答任务。

Result: 在多个下游医学多模态任务上的实验验证，MIMO能够独特地结合视觉参考和像素定位能力，这是先前模型所不具备的。

Conclusion: MIMO模型能够有效解决医学视觉语言模型在输入和输出方面的局限性，通过多模态输入输出实现更好的医学图像理解和语义定位。

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

TL;DR: 提出Query-Adapter（Q-Adapter），一种轻量级视觉适配器模块，用于增强多模态大语言模型在视频字幕任务中的高效微调，仅需1.4%参数即可达到与全参数微调相竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法主要关注语言组件，在多模态任务中研究不足，且缺乏对视觉信息在微调过程中理解的充分探索。

Method: 在视觉编码器中引入可学习的查询令牌和门控层，无需外部文本监督即可有效提取稀疏的、与字幕相关的特征。

Result: 在MSR-VTT和MSVD数据集上，在BLEU@4、METEOR、ROUGE-L和CIDEr指标上均达到参数高效微调方法中的最先进性能。

Conclusion: Q-Adapter在平衡字幕质量和参数效率方面展现出强大潜力，证明了其在视频语言建模中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态3D高斯泼溅算法忽视了动态场景中固有的时空冗余，导致内存消耗过高，需要一种更紧凑的表示方法。

Method: 设计基于3D锚点的时空预测模块来利用高斯基元间的时空相关性，并结合自适应量化和上下文熵编码来压缩锚点数据。

Conclusion: P-4DGS通过有效利用时空相关性实现了高效的动态场景压缩，在保持高质量重建的同时大幅降低了存储需求。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

Motivation: 传统CNN方法受限于局部感受野，而Transformer方法在提取多模态系数和时序动态方面存在不足，需要更全面的空间-时间上下文建模。

Method: 使用并行双边架构的早期集成模块融合多尺度视觉特征和音频数据；多查询Transformer模块动态赋予音频查询学习能力，同时建模帧级和视频级关系；双模态对比学习促进统一特征空间中的跨模态对齐。

Result: 在S4、MS3和AVSS数据集上均达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: CCFormer通过结合局部和全局信息处理以及全面的空间-时间上下文捕捉，有效提升了音频-视觉分割性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学视觉语言模型通常依赖单次推理，忽略了局部视觉线索，而人类专家在临床实践中会迭代扫描、聚焦和优化感兴趣区域。ViTAR旨在缩小这种机器与人类感知差距。

Method: 提出ViTAR框架，将医学图像视为交互对象，支持多步骤视觉推理。构建了包含1K交互示例的高质量指令数据集和16K视觉问答训练数据。采用两阶段训练策略：先进行监督微调引导认知轨迹，然后使用强化学习优化决策。

Result: 广泛评估表明ViTAR优于现有最先进模型。视觉注意力分析显示，从"思考"到"再思考"阶段，ViTAR逐渐将视觉基础锚定到临床关键区域，并在推理过程中保持对视觉标记的高注意力分配。

Conclusion: 将专家风格的迭代思维链嵌入视觉语言模型中，可以同时提升医学AI的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly
proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included
in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and
other related areas.

TL;DR: 提出CLSL方法解决多标签图像识别中标签不完整问题，通过语义感知特征学习和标签恢复的协同学习框架，在MS-COCO、VOC2007和NUS-WIDE数据集上取得最优性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签图像识别中标签不完整任务面临两个核心挑战：语义感知特征学习和缺失标签恢复，需要统一解决这两个问题

Method: 设计语义相关特征学习模块学习鲁棒语义特征，提出语义引导特征增强模块生成高质量语义感知特征，引入协同学习框架整合特征学习和标签恢复

Result: 在三个广泛使用的公共数据集上，CLSL方法优于现有的多标签图像识别方法

Conclusion: CLSL方法通过协同学习语义感知特征和标签恢复，形成了相互增强的循环，有效解决了多标签图像识别中的标签不完整问题

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

*Pîrvu Mihai-Cristian,Leordeanu Marius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PHG-MAE模型，将神经图与掩码自编码器结合，通过随机掩码整个模态（不仅是图像块）来采样超边分布，统一了预训练和微调过程，并支持推理时集成和知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用自监督预训练方法（如MAE）无需手动标注数据的优势，结合神经图理论，为多模态多任务学习开发统一框架，特别针对无人机户外场景。

Method: PHG-MAE模型：1）随机掩码整个模态而非仅图像块；2）将预训练和微调整合到单一训练循环；3）支持推理时集成；4）可在小模型（<1M参数）上应用知识蒸馏。

Result: 开发了数据管道软件，创建并发布了Dronescapes数据集的自动化扩展版本，所有技术细节、代码和复现步骤均已公开。

Conclusion: PHG-MAE为多模态多任务学习提供了统一的理论框架，特别适用于无人机户外场景，并可推广到自动驾驶、室内机器人等类似领域。

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉基础模型的通用框架，用于追踪大规模滑坡疤痕的时空演化过程，通过将离散遥感图像重构为连续视频序列来实现连续监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于单阶段或前后双阶段滑坡识别，难以追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演化过程，这限制了早期预警和演化机制的理解。

Method: 将离散光学遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，利用为视频分割开发的视觉基础模型，在知识引导、自动传播和交互式精炼的范式下实现滑坡疤痕的连续准确识别。

Result: 在巴格滑坡和色拉滑坡两个代表性案例中验证了框架的有效性，能够连续追踪滑坡疤痕，捕捉早期预警所需的前兆特征和评估次生灾害所需的灾后演化过程。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演化，为早期预警和长期稳定性评估提供重要支持。

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

*Jiahui Lu,Haihong Xiao,Xueyan Zhao,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的框架，能够从无姿态的稀疏图像中实现鲁棒的新视角合成和几何一致的重建，通过VGGT基础模型获取初始姿态和密集点云，结合混合高斯表示和深度正则化等技术提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF和3DGS方法严重依赖准确的相机姿态和密集视角覆盖，这在稀疏视图设置中限制了应用，因为姿态估计不可靠且监督不足。

Method: 1) 使用VGGT基础模型获取可靠的初始姿态和密集点云；2) 混合高斯表示结合位置-形状双优化和视图间匹配一致性；3) 图引导属性细化模块增强场景细节；4) 基于光流的深度正则化提升深度估计精度。

Result: 在正向视角和大规模复杂数据集上的综合定量和定性实验表明，该方法相比其他无姿态方法实现了更鲁棒的性能。

Conclusion: Gesplat框架成功克服了传统方法在稀疏视图设置中的限制，实现了从无姿态稀疏图像的鲁棒3D重建和新视角合成。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，提出FedCoPL方法，利用CLIP模型通过伪标签分布估计和调整来解决类别不平衡问题，并通过部分提示聚合实现有效协作和个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督联邦学习主要关注表示学习和聚类任务，而视觉语言模型（如CLIP）的零样本预测能力为分类问题提供了新机会，但目前尚未在无监督联邦学习框架下探索。

Method: 提出FedCoPL方法：客户端估计并上传伪标签分布，服务器调整并重新分配以避免全局类别不平衡；引入部分提示聚合协议，服务器聚合视觉提示，客户端保留文本提示以实现协作和个性化。

Result: 大量实验表明FedCoPL相比基线方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 成功将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，FedCoPL方法通过伪标签分布调整和部分提示聚合有效解决了类别不平衡问题，实现了良好的协作和个性化效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了ACRE方法，通过一致性检查增强强化学习，解决推理链与最终答案不一致的问题，在视频推理和数学推理任务上分别提升2.2%和1.5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于结果的强化学习方法虽然提高了答案准确性，但可能导致推理过程与最终答案不一致，在MMVU任务中标准GRPO方法只有79.7%的一致性

Method: 修改GRPO算法，加入辅助一致性检查：在模型生成推理链和初始答案后，打乱选项顺序，用相同推理链预测第二个答案，设计一致性验证奖励机制

Result: 在视频推理和数学推理基准测试中，相比GRPO基线分别平均提升2.2%和1.5%

Conclusion: ACRE方法有效解决了推理-答案不一致问题，减少了模型对虚假模式（如选项顺序偏见）的依赖

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的后检测框架，通过统计不确定性和视觉特征重新调整检测置信度，提升紧凑型深度学习模型在火灾烟雾检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的火灾烟雾检测方法在效率和可靠性之间存在平衡问题，紧凑型深度学习模型（如YOLOv5n/YOLOv8n）在部署时容易出现误报和漏检，传统后处理方法仅依赖空间重叠，在复杂场景中效果有限。

Method: 提出轻量级置信度精炼网络，集成不确定性估计与颜色、边缘、纹理等视觉特征，在不修改基础模型的情况下调整检测分数。

Result: 在D-Fire数据集上的实验显示，相比现有基线方法，精度、召回率和平均精度均有提升，且计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 后检测重新评分能有效增强紧凑型深度学习模型在真实世界火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ImmerIris数据集，这是首个专为沉浸式VR/AR场景下离轴虹膜识别设计的大规模数据集，包含499,791张眼部图像。研究发现传统基于归一化的方法在离轴场景下表现不佳，提出了无需归一化的新范式，在沉浸式识别中表现更优。

Conclusion: 沉浸式虹膜识别需要新的方法范式，无需归一化的直接学习方法比传统方法更适合处理离轴采集带来的挑战，为鲁棒沉浸式识别指明了新方向。

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

Conclusion: 该方法有望成为支持临床医生进行帕金森病监测和进展跟踪的有前景的非侵入性工具。

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

Motivation: 现有低光照图像增强方法存在SSIM和PSNR分数低、计算复杂度高的问题；超分辨率方法中GAN模型复杂，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用DeepFusionNet架构，包含约250万参数用于低光照增强，约10万参数用于超分辨率，基于自动编码器而非GAN。

Result: 在LOL-v1数据集上，低光照增强达到SSIM 92.8%、PSNR 26.30；超分辨率达到PSNR 25.30、SSIM 80.7%。

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet在保持较低参数量的同时，显著提升了低光照图像增强和超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time
detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of
YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

*Yecong Wan,Mingwen Shao,Renlong Wu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Color3D是一个用于静态和动态3D场景着色的灵活框架，通过单张关键视图着色和个性化着色器微调，在保持颜色多样性和可控性的同时确保跨视图和时间的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注静态场景，通过平均颜色变化来强制多视图一致性，但这牺牲了色彩丰富性和可控性。需要一种既能保持颜色多样性又能确保一致性的3D着色方法。

Method: 核心方法是仅对单张关键视图着色，然后微调个性化着色器将颜色传播到新视图和时间步。通过个性化学习场景特定的确定性颜色映射，利用着色器的归纳偏置将对应颜色一致地投影到新视图和视频帧。

Result: 在多样化的静态和动态3D着色基准测试中，该方法能够提供更一致且色彩丰富的渲染结果，并具有精确的用户控制能力。

Conclusion: 该框架巧妙地将复杂的3D着色问题重新表述为更易处理的单图像范式，允许无缝集成任意图像着色模型，增强了灵活性和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

TL;DR: 提出Stroke Locus Net，一种端到端深度学习管道，使用MRI扫描进行检测、分割和闭塞血管定位


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺血性卒中诊断中准确定位闭塞血管是关键挑战，现有机器学习方法主要关注病变分割，血管定位研究有限

Method: 结合nnUNet分割分支用于病变检测、动脉图谱用于血管映射识别，以及pGAN生成分支从MRI合成MRA图像

Result: 在卒中影响的T1 MRI扫描上显示出有前景的闭塞血管定位结果

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力实现更快、更知情的卒中诊断

Abstract: A key challenge in ischemic stroke diagnosis using medical imaging is the
accurate localization of the occluded vessel. Current machine learning methods
in focus primarily on lesion segmentation, with limited work on vessel
localization. In this study, we introduce Stroke Locus Net, an end-to-end deep
learning pipeline for detection, segmentation, and occluded vessel localization
using only MRI scans. The proposed system combines a segmentation branch using
nnUNet for lesion detection with an arterial atlas for vessel mapping and
identification, and a generation branch using pGAN to synthesize MRA images
from MRI. Our implementation demonstrates promising results in localizing
occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, with potential for faster and
more informed stroke diagnosis.

*Benjia Zhou,Bin Fu,Pei Cheng,Yanru Wang,Jiayuan Fan,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMix是一个统一的角色一致性生成和编辑框架，包含ReMix模块和IP-ControlNet两个核心组件，解决了现有方法在身份一致性和空间可控性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在单一框架中统一角色生成和编辑任务。生成方法在跨实例的细粒度身份一致性上表现不佳，而编辑方法往往失去空间可控性和指令对齐能力。

Method: ReMix模块利用MLLM的多模态推理能力编辑输入图像的语义特征，并将指令嵌入适配到原生DiT骨干网络；IP-ControlNet扩展ControlNet，从参考图像解耦语义和布局线索，并在共享噪声空间中联合去噪参考图像和目标图像。

Result: ReMix支持个性化生成、图像编辑、风格迁移和多条件合成等多种任务，实验验证了其作为统一框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ReMix通过创新的模块设计和噪声空间共享机制，成功实现了角色一致性图像生成和编辑的统一框架，在保持身份一致性的同时提供了良好的可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SaFiRe框架解决指称图像分割中的模糊表达问题，通过模拟人类两阶段认知过程来处理对象干扰和类别隐式表达，并引入aRefCOCO新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RIS方法主要处理简单表达，无法有效应对现实世界中常见的模糊指称表达，如对象干扰表达和类别隐式表达。

Method: 提出SaFiRe框架，模拟人类两阶段认知过程：先形成全局理解，再进行细节导向的细化。利用Mamba的扫描-更新特性实现高效多周期细化。

Result: 在标准数据集和新提出的aRefCOCO基准上的大量实验表明，SaFiRe优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: SaFiRe通过两阶段认知建模有效解决了RIS中的模糊表达问题，Mamba的线性复杂度特性支持高效的多周期细化。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: SparseUWSeg是一个用于水下图像语义分割的框架，通过主动采样策略和混合标签传播方法，在稀疏点标注的情况下实现高效分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像分析对生态监测很重要，但获取密集专家标注成本高昂。稀疏点标注更容易获得，但面临如何选择标注点和传播稀疏信息的挑战。

Method: 采用主动采样策略指导标注者选择最有价值的点，然后结合SAM2和超像素方法的混合方法传播稀疏标签。

Result: 在两个不同水下数据集上的实验表明，SparseUWSeg优于现有方法，比D+NN提高了5% mIoU。

Conclusion: 开发了一个简单有效的交互式标注工具，使生态研究人员能够利用基础模型和计算机视觉高效生成高质量分割掩码。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

TL;DR: ViConEx-Med是一个基于Transformer的可视化概念可解释性框架，通过多概念可学习token联合预测和定位视觉概念，在医学数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念模型将概念视为数值属性，缺乏可视化解释来定位预测概念，限制了在高风险场景（如医疗应用）中的实用性。

Method: 提出ViConEx-Med框架，引入多概念可学习token，利用专门的注意力层处理视觉和基于文本的概念token，生成概念级定位图。

Result: 在合成和真实医学数据集上的实验表明，ViConEx-Med在概念检测和定位精度方面优于现有概念模型，并与黑盒模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建基于视觉概念的内在可解释模型提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注物体前表面的3D坐标预测精度，忽略了利用物体后表面和内部的潜力

Method: 预测物体前后表面的3D坐标并在其间密集采样，创建超密集2D-3D对应关系，提出分层连续坐标编码(HCCE)来准确高效表示坐标

Result: 在BOP网站的七个经典核心数据集上均优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 通过利用物体完整表面和内部信息，结合超密集对应关系和HCCE编码，显著提升了姿态估计精度

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机产生大量视频数据，但现有数据集存在标注粗糙冗余的问题，无人机领域的文本-视频检索研究不足。

Method: 构建DVTMD数据集，提出TCMA框架整合全局视频-句子对齐、句子引导帧聚合和词语引导补丁对齐，并设计了词语补丁选择模块和文本自适应动态温度机制。

Result: 在DVTMD和CapERA数据集上建立首个完整基准，TCMA在文本到视频检索中R@1达到45.5%，视频到文本检索中R@1达到42.8%。

Conclusion: DVTMD数据集和TCMA框架有效解决了无人机视频检索问题，为无人机文本-视频检索领域提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

TL;DR: 提出伪平衡方法，通过在半监督学习中强制人口统计平衡来选择伪标签，无需真实标注即可缓解人脸性别分类模型中的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸性别分类模型经常反映并放大训练数据中的人口统计偏见，导致在不同性别和种族子组中表现不均。

Method: 伪平衡方法在伪标签选择过程中强制人口统计平衡，仅使用来自种族平衡数据集的未标记图像，无需真实标注。

Result: 伪平衡方法在整体准确率达到79.81%，比基线提高6.53%，性别准确率差距减少44.17%。在东亚子组中，基线差距超过49%，该方法将差距缩小到仅5.01%。

Conclusion: 即使在没有标签监督的情况下，访问人口统计平衡或适度倾斜的未标记数据集可以作为消除现有计算机视觉模型偏见的有力资源。

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法仅建模成对物体关系，忽略了n元组合在多模态关系理解中的全局感知重要性，导致3D-语言对齐困难。

Method: 使用分组监督损失促进n元关系学习，在n元关系构建的场景图中，采用具有混合注意力机制的多模态网络进一步定位目标。

Result: 在ReferIt3D和ScanRefer基准测试中的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法，证明了n元关系感知在3D定位中的优势。

Conclusion: n元关系学习能够有效提升3D物体定位性能，特别是在处理涉及多个空间关系的复杂描述时表现出色。

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness

*Yuxiang Lai,Jike Zhong,Ming Li,Yuheng Li,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 大型视觉模型在零样本设置下直接应用于医学影像任务，无需医学数据训练，在器官分割、去噪、超分辨率和放疗运动预测等任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归视频建模原理是否可以直接应用于医学影像任务，尽管模型从未在医学数据上训练过。

Method: 在零样本设置下评估大型视觉模型（LVM），应用于四个代表性任务：器官分割、去噪、超分辨率和运动预测。

Result: 即使没有领域特定微调，LVM能够在CT扫描中描绘解剖结构，在分割、去噪和超分辨率任务中达到竞争性性能。在放疗运动预测中，模型从4D CT扫描的前期阶段直接预测未来3D CT阶段，产生解剖学一致的预测。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了医学视频建模中零样本能力的出现，突显了通用视频模型作为统一学习器和推理器的潜力，为未来基于视频模型的医学基础模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

### [67] [Opacity-Gradient Driven Density Control for Compact and Efficient Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10257)
*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个改进3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景下效率的框架，通过新的致密化触发机制和保守剪枝策略，显著减少基元数量，在保持重建质量的同时实现更高的紧凑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景中容易过拟合并产生臃肿的重建结果，现有方法虽然提高了质量但显著增加了基元数量。本文旨在优化3DGS的核心优化过程以优先考虑效率。

Method: 用基于不透明度梯度的新型致密化触发机制替代标准位置梯度启发式方法，结合更保守的剪枝策略防止破坏性优化循环，并使用标准深度相关损失进行几何指导。

Result: 在3视图LLFF数据集上，模型比FSGS紧凑40%以上（32k vs. 57k基元）；在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上实现约70%的减少，在质量与效率的帕累托前沿上达到新的最优水平。

Conclusion: 该框架通过重新设计致密化和剪枝策略，在少样本视图合成中实现了效率的根本性改进，建立了质量与效率权衡的新标准。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

TL;DR: VividAnimator是一个端到端的半身人体动画生成框架，通过音频和稀疏手部姿态条件驱动，解决了现有方法中头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频和姿态驱动的人体动画方法存在头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题，主要原因是音频与头部运动相关性弱，以及手部结构复杂。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1) 预训练手部清晰度码本(HCC)编码高保真手部纹理先验；2) 双流音频感知模块(DSAA)分别建模唇部同步和自然头部姿态动态；3) 姿态校准技巧(PCT)通过放松刚性约束来优化姿态条件。

Conclusion: VividAnimator通过创新的手部码本、双流音频建模和姿态校准技术，成功解决了音频和姿态驱动动画中的关键问题，实现了高质量的人体动画生成。

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法通常只使用透视视图或鸟瞰图特征，无法同时利用细粒度目标细节和结构化场景表示，限制了感知性能。

Method: 提出混合检测跟踪框架，结合PV和BEV特征，引入基础模型引导的BEV映射，通过新颖的蒸馏过程将DINOv2特征蒸馏到BEV表示中，使用可变形聚合增强3D检测跟踪。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明了基础模型BEV映射在自动驾驶感知中的潜力。

Conclusion: DualViewDistill通过结合PV和BEV特征的互补优势，利用基础模型增强BEV表示，为自动驾驶提供了更可靠的感知能力。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2虽然能够在低资源设置下实现快速推理，但其微调仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 在图像编码器和掩码解码器中集成低秩适配器，并使用结合分割BCE、SoftDice和FocalTversky损失的复合损失函数进行网络调优。

Result: 在11个具有挑战性的眼底分割数据集上评估，SAM2LoRA在跨数据集训练条件下在血管和视盘分割方面表现出高性能，分别达到0.86和0.93的Dice分数，以及0.98和0.99的AUC值。

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA在显著减少训练开销的同时实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界场景（如ScanNet中的场景）难以捕捉，可用数据有限。生成具有多样化物体姿态的逼真场景仍然是一个开放且具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 引入分解表示法，将场景分解为层次化组织的房间程序和物体姿态概念。学习可重用布局模式的函数库，使用大语言模型生成高级程序，并学习程序条件模型来层次化预测物体姿态，检索并放置3D物体。

Result: FactoredScenes生成了逼真的真实世界房间，难以与真实的ScanNet场景区分开来。

Conclusion: 该框架成功利用场景结构和物体姿态变化学习，实现了高质量3D场景的合成，在真实感方面表现出色。

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent
transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper
presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language
reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an
ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling
semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance
interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate
annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7
percent accuracy, an F1 score of 0.752, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of
0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results

incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄影测量需要70-80%的图像重叠率才能实现准确几何配准，但AI系统在资源受限条件下难以达到此要求，导致重建质量下降，影响农民对自主监测技术的信任度。

Method: 采用基于光流的框架，通过中间光流估计在连续航拍帧之间合成过渡图像，人工增强特征对应关系以改进几何重建。

Result: 实验验证显示最低重叠率要求降低了20%，提高了在稀疏航拍图像数据集上生成可靠正射影像的能力。

Conclusion: Ortho-Fuse框架通过降低重叠率要求，有助于克服精准农业中AI驱动监测系统的采用障碍，促进技术集成。

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

Conclusion: PointMAC是首个将元辅助测试时自适应应用于点云补全的工作，能够有效提升模型对未知结构和传感器失真的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

TL;DR: 该论文讨论了CNN在图像分类中的隐藏偏见问题，提出了两种方法来区分上下文信息和背景噪声，并在六个数据集上进行了验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN作为黑盒模型难以解释决策过程，容易受到背景信息的偏见影响，需要开发方法来识别这些隐藏偏见。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）将图像分割成随机打乱的非重叠小块；2）应用傅里叶变换、小波变换和中值滤波器等图像变换来恢复背景噪声信息。

Result: 这些方法能有效区分上下文信息和背景噪声，即使在没有背景信息的情况下也能检测到背景噪声的存在。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够识别CNN中的隐藏偏见，帮助区分有用的上下文信息和有害的背景噪声，提高模型的可解释性。

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

*Zhao-Yang Wang,Jieneng Chen,Jiang Liu,Yuxiang Guo,Rama Chellappa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh-Gait是一个新颖的多模态步态识别框架，通过从2D轮廓直接重建3D表示，结合了2D和3D模态的优势，在保持计算效率的同时实现了最先进的识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统步态识别方法使用2D表示（如轮廓或骨架）容易受到视角变化、遮挡和噪声的影响。多模态方法虽然更鲁棒但计算成本高，难以实时应用。需要一种既能利用3D形状信息又保持计算效率的方法。

Method: 提出Mesh-Gait框架，通过重建3D热图作为中间表示，从2D轮廓学习3D几何信息。使用监督学习逐步重建准确的3D热图，损失函数计算重建的3D关节、虚拟标记和3D网格与真实值之间的差异。同时从轮廓和重建的3D热图中提取判别性特征。

Result: 大量实验表明Mesh-Gait达到了最先进的识别精度，同时避免了从RGB视频直接进行3D重建的沉重计算开销。

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait通过创新的中间3D热图表示，有效结合了2D和3D模态的优势，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了步态识别性能，为解决视角变化和遮挡问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像特征匹配方法在处理大量特征点时效率较低，特征空间顺序作为独立于极线几何的概念，可以补充指导特征匹配，提高匹配效率。

Method: 将特征空间顺序整合到渐进匹配框架中，利用初始匹配特征构建空间顺序计算模型，预测后续特征匹配的可能空间范围，过滤不必要的匹配，并与极线几何结合。同时提出基于基础矩阵的图像对齐方法来消除图像旋转的影响。

Result: 在标准基准数据集、自生成模拟图像和真实图像上的实验表明，该方法比传统方法显著更高效且匹配更准确。

Conclusion: 提出的结合特征空间顺序和极线几何的渐进匹配方法能够有效提高图像特征匹配的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前步态识别方法通常只关注2D或3D单一模态，难以捕捉人类行走模式的完整几何和动态复杂性。需要多模态融合来提升在挑战性环境下的识别性能。

Method: 使用多模态多任务框架，结合2D时序轮廓和3D SMPL特征，通过统一transformer进行特征融合，同时执行步态识别和人体属性估计（年龄、BMI、性别）。

Result: 在BRIAR大规模数据集上的实验表明，该方法在长距离（达1公里）和极端俯仰角（达50度）等挑战条件下，优于现有最先进方法，并能提供准确的人体属性估计。

Conclusion: 多模态和多任务学习在真实世界场景中推进基于步态的人类理解方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 使用迁移学习和LSTM网络从VR游戏视频中提取视觉特征，预测网络晕动症严重程度，准确率达到68.4%，超越现有仅基于视频数据的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VR技术的快速发展，网络晕动症问题持续阻碍其广泛应用。现有研究多关注多模态深度学习方法，但基于视频特征预测网络晕动症的研究有限。

Method: 使用在ImageNet上预训练的InceptionV3模型提取VR游戏视频的高级视觉特征，然后通过LSTM网络捕捉VR体验的时间动态特征来预测网络晕动症严重程度。

Result: 该方法实现了68.4%的网络晕动症严重程度分类准确率，超越了仅基于视频数据训练的现有模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为VR开发者提供了评估和缓解网络晕动症的实际工具，并为基于视频的时间建模研究奠定了基础，有助于提升VR应用的用户舒适度。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

*Suyang Xi,Chenxi Yang,Hong Ding,Yiqing Ni,Catherine C. Liu,Yunhao Liu,Chengqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuLiRAG是一个模仿人类认知过程的多模态检索增强生成框架，通过"what-where-reweight"级联方法解决MLLMs在细粒度视觉问答中的幻觉问题，提升定位保真度和事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中经常产生关于物体身份、位置和关系的幻觉，因为文本查询没有明确锚定到视觉参考物。现有的检索增强生成方法在检索和增强层面都与人类处理方式不一致，缺乏局部细节和细粒度交互推理。

Method: 提出HuLiRAG框架，采用"what-where-reweight"级联：1）通过开放词汇检测将查询锚定到候选参考物（what）；2）使用SAM生成的掩码进行空间解析以恢复细粒度精度（where）；3）通过局部与全局对齐的权衡进行自适应优先级排序（reweight）。掩码引导的微调将空间证据注入生成过程。

Result: 大量实验表明，这种类人级联方法提高了定位保真度和事实一致性，同时减少了幻觉，推动了多模态问答向可信推理发展。

Conclusion: HuLiRAG通过模仿人类认知的级联处理，将定位从被动偏置转变为答案制定的显式约束，有效解决了MLLMs在细粒度视觉问答中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion是一个单目SE(3)扩散框架，通过条件去噪扩散过程进行无标记的基于图像的机器人姿态估计，在DREAM和RoboKeyGen基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法使用固定尺度扰动，缺乏多样性和视野约束，限制了网络泛化能力。需要一种能够生成视野内多样化训练姿态并实现渐进式姿态优化的方法。

Method: 提出可见性约束扩散过程进行多样化姿态增强和基于时间步的反向过程进行渐进式姿态优化。扩散过程将真实姿态扰动为噪声变换，反向过程通过去噪网络迭代预测并细化姿态估计。

Result: 在两个基准测试(DREAM和RoboKeyGen)上均有改进，在最具挑战性的数据集上达到66.75的AUC，比现有最优方法提升32.3%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过扩散过程生成多样化训练数据，通过反向过程实现鲁棒的姿态估计，显著提升了单目机器人姿态估计的性能。

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: 提出了CoDeGraph算法，通过检测和过滤一致性异常来解决零样本图像异常分类和分割问题，利用"邻居耗尽"现象识别工业图像中的重复缺陷模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于表示的方法在处理一致性异常（跨多个图像重复出现的相似缺陷）时表现不佳，导致异常分类和分割性能下降。

Method: CoDeGraph构建图像级图，将图像作为节点，连接具有共享一致性异常模式的图像，使用社区检测来过滤这些异常。基于极端值理论提供理论支撑。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ViT-L-14-336骨干网络实现98.3%的AUROC异常分类性能，分割性能达到66.8% F1和68.1% AP，比现有方法分别提升4.2%和5.4%。使用DINOv2骨干网络进一步提升分割性能至69.1% F1和71.9% AP。

Conclusion: CoDeGraph能有效识别和过滤一致性异常，在零样本异常检测任务中表现出色，且对不同骨干网络具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

Conclusion: 通过将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声，为构建更鲁棒和可信的医疗AI系统提供了清晰路径。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Result: 在MultiTIPS数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法，具有强大的跨域泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架在临床应用中具有潜力，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在严重幻觉问题，倾向于生成与图像无关但语言流畅的响应，主要原因是语言偏见。

Method: 通过自适应掩码最有影响力的图像token的注意力权重来降解视觉-语言感知，利用原始模型与降解模型输出分布的差异进行解码。

Result: CMG在幻觉特定基准测试中显著提升不同VLM的性能，并能有效泛化，不损害VLM原有能力。

Conclusion: CMG是一种无需训练的解码方法，通过强调视觉上下文感知显著减少语言偏见，有效解决VLM的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

Motivation: 现有伪图像表示方法在处理非结构化点云时往往忽略点云的结构和语义细节，导致特征融合和可区分性受限。

Method: 1. 全局-局部特征融合编码模块增强局部特征相关性并捕获全局上下文信息；2. 多分支特征提取网络捕获更多邻域信息并增强轮廓特征可区分性；3. 深度特征引导注意力机制提升跨通道特征融合精度。

Conclusion: DAGLFNet在保持实时性的同时实现了高性能，在基于LiDAR的实时应用中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

Motivation: 微手势识别需要同时建模长程和局部时空依赖。CNN受限于感受野，Transformer计算成本高，而原始Mamba缺乏局部时空建模能力和运动感知设计。

Method: 提出MSF-Mamba，通过基于中心帧差分的运动感知状态融合模块融合局部上下文相邻状态，增强Mamba的局部时空建模。还提出了多尺度版本MSF-Mamba+，支持多尺度运动感知状态融合和自适应尺度加权。

Conclusion: MSF-Mamba通过运动感知状态融合有效解决了原始Mamba在微手势识别中的局限性，能够捕捉细微运动线索，在性能和效率上都表现出色。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在无监督指令训练下的潜力，验证其是否具备自我精炼能力，从而摆脱对外部监督数据的依赖。

Method: 提出基于三角一致性原则的自精炼框架：1)通过多任务指令调优激活指令生成能力；2)从未标注图像生成图像-查询-答案三元组并用三角一致性过滤；3)使用过滤后的合成数据进一步更新模型。

Result: 以LLaVA-1.5为基线，实验表明模型无需任何外部监督即可在多个基准测试中实现一致且稳定的性能提升。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型确实具备自我精炼能力，这一发现可为未来研究VLMs学习机制提供重要启示。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

*Jiaye Li,Baoyou Chen,Hui Li,Zilong Dong,Jingdong Wang,Siyu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了HARoPE，一种基于SVD参数化的可学习线性变换的头自适应旋转位置编码扩展，解决了标准多维RoPE在图像生成中的局限性，显著提升了细粒度空间关系建模和结构偏差捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准旋转位置编码(RoPE)在1D领域表现出色，但在图像生成中存在明显局限：细粒度空间关系建模不足、颜色线索捕捉困难、物体计数能力弱。这些限制源于其刚性频率分配、轴间独立性和统一头处理方式。

Method: 提出HARoPE方法，在旋转映射前插入通过奇异值分解(SVD)参数化的可学习线性变换。这种轻量级修改实现了动态频率重分配、旋转平面语义对齐和头特定位置感受野，同时严格保持RoPE的相对位置特性。

Result: 在类条件ImageNet和文生图任务(Flux和MMDiT)上的广泛实验表明，HARoPE始终优于强RoPE基线和其他扩展方法，性能得到一致提升。

Conclusion: HARoPE可作为有效的即插即用替代方案，为基于Transformer的图像生成模型提供了原则性且适应性强的位置感知增强解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image
generative models.

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D是一个基于多视角扩散的3D风格迁移方法，通过拼图操作解耦风格与内容，实现快速、视角一致的3D资产风格化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖直接参考风格注入或2D扩散模型蒸馏，存在每场景优化成本高、风格与语义内容纠缠的问题

Method: 使用拼图操作（空间打乱和随机掩码参考图像块）抑制对象语义并分离风格统计特征，通过参考到视角的交叉注意力将风格线索整合到多视角扩散模型中

Result: 在标准3D风格化基准测试中，Jigsaw3D实现了高风格保真度和多视角一致性，延迟显著降低，并能泛化到掩码部分参考风格化、多对象场景风格化和可平铺纹理生成

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D提供了一种有效解耦风格与内容的方法，实现了快速且视角一致的3D风格迁移

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker)框架，通过视觉推理操作和可配置视觉记忆窗口，让多模态奖励模型能够主动获取和更新视觉证据，解决了现有模型因视觉输入占用大量上下文预算而丢失细节的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态奖励模型面临两个主要限制：(1)视觉输入消耗大量上下文预算，导致只能使用较少帧数并丢失细粒度细节；(2)所有视觉信息都打包到初始提示中，加剧了链式推理过程中的幻觉和遗忘问题。

Method: 采用强化微调流程：(i)使用策划的视觉链式思维数据进行冷启动，蒸馏基本推理技能和操作格式化；(ii)选择所有维度判断都正确的样本，对这些高质量轨迹进行拒绝采样微调；(iii)应用组相对策略优化来加强推理能力。

Result: 在视频偏好基准测试中达到最先进精度，特别是在长视频上：7B VR-Thinker在VideoGen Reward上达到80.5%，在GenAI-Bench上达到82.3%，在MJ-Bench-Video上达到75.6%。

Conclusion: 验证了基于图像思维的多模态奖励建模方法的有效性和前景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种扩展CNN感受野的LUT方法，通过自适应向量量化、不规则空洞卷积和U型级联结构，在固定表大小下提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LUT方法因表大小组合爆炸导致感受野受限，需要在保持空间复杂度不变的情况下扩展感受野。

Method: 学习最优格点向量量化器自适应分配量化分辨率，结合不规则空洞卷积和U型级联LUT结构捕获多级上下文信息。

Result: 在保持相同空间复杂度的同时，显著提升了LUT驱动快速CNN推理的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了速度、精度和内存效率，相比现有LUT方法有显著改进。

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Motivation: 克服先前开放词汇分割和上下文分割方法在架构差异、学习目标和表示学习策略上的不一致性，实现统一的多模态分割框架。

Method: 利用基础模型提取输入图像和多模态提示的表示，通过SegDecoder对齐这些表示、建模它们的交互，并生成由输入提示指定的掩码。

Result: 在开放词汇分割和上下文分割任务上均取得显著性能提升，视觉和文本提示的协同使用显著改善了泛化能力。

Conclusion: COSINE成功统一了开放词汇分割和上下文分割，多模态提示的协同作用比单模态方法具有更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

Conclusion: 将模式分析嵌入识别阶段能够有效融合计算机视觉和语言建模，为智能交通和监控应用提供更强的适应性。

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

Motivation: 冰川湖溃决洪水是高山地区罕见但破坏性强的灾害，现有研究受限于碎片化和单模态数据，缺乏用于预测的统一数据集。

Method: 整合三种互补数据源：Sentinel-2用于空间监测、NASA ITS_LIVE用于冰川运动学、MODIS用于地表温度记录。进行云掩膜、质量过滤、归一化、时间插值、数据增强和周期性编码等预处理，然后跨模态协调。

Conclusion: GLOFNet通过解决类别不平衡、云污染和粗分辨率等挑战，为罕见灾害预测的多模态深度学习方法提供了结构化基准测试基础。

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway

Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep
auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and

Motivation: 现有统一分词器在视觉理解与生成之间存在显著性能权衡，源于高层语义抽象与低层像素重建之间的内在冲突，需要开发能同时兼顾两者的解决方案。

Conclusion: UniFlow通过创新的自适应蒸馏和像素流解码器设计，成功解决了视觉理解与生成之间的性能权衡，实现了统一建模的双赢结果。

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

Result: 提出的Diff-ABFlow框架能够有效处理高速和低光场景下的光流估计问题

Conclusion: 扩散模型结合帧-事件融合为退化场景下的光流估计提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

Motivation: 预训练视觉基础模型在OOD检测任务中的潜力尚未充分探索，尽管它们具有学习判别性和泛化性特征的能力。

Method: 1）评估预训练基础模型在OOD检测中的表现；2）提出MoFE模块分割特征子空间；3）引入Dynamic-β Mixup策略自适应调整插值权重。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉基础模型为OOD检测提供了强大基础，但需要专门设计来处理大语义空间的挑战，MoFE和Dynamic-β Mixup策略有效提升了性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

*Jingchao Wang,Wenlong Zhang,Dingjiang Huang,Hong Wang,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FSVG方法，通过特征选择机制实现视觉定位，在准确性和效率之间取得更好平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法需要迭代处理不同图像尺度，并在每次迭代中缓存语言和视觉特征，带来额外计算开销

Method: 构建包含语言和视觉模态的整体网络架构，使用基于相似度的特征选择机制仅利用语言相关的视觉特征

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验证明，FSVG在准确性和效率方面超越了当前最先进方法

Conclusion: FSVG提供了一种简单有效的视觉定位基准方法，无需复杂迭代过程，实现了更好的准确性和效率平衡

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

### [105] [ViSurf: Visual Supervised-and-Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Large Vision-and-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10606)
*Yuqi Liu,Liangyu Chen,Jiazhen Liu,Mingkang Zhu,Zhisheng Zhong,Bei Yu,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSurf是一种统一的后训练范式，将监督微调(SFT)和基于可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)的优势整合在单一阶段中，通过在RLVR过程中注入真实标签来同时提供外部监督和内部强化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练方法存在局限性：SFT通常导致次优性能，而RLVR在处理超出模型内部知识库的任务时表现不佳。需要一种能结合两者优势的统一方法。

Method: 提出ViSurf范式，分析推导SFT和RLVR目标以建立统一目标，在RLVR过程中注入真实标签，并引入三种新的奖励控制策略来稳定和优化训练过程。

Result: 在多个不同基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ViSurf优于单独的SFT、RLVR以及两阶段的SFT→RLVR方法。

Conclusion: ViSurf通过统一SFT和RLVR的优势，有效解决了传统后训练方法的局限性，深度分析验证了其推导和设计原则的有效性。

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniQuality-R是一个统一奖励建模框架，将多任务质量推理转化为连续可解释的奖励信号，用于策略优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉评估方法通常局限于单一任务，需要解决多任务质量评估的统一框架问题。

Method: 构建推理增强的奖励建模数据集，通过拒绝采样获取信息化的计划-推理轨迹，形成可靠的思维链数据集用于监督微调。采用GRPO进行后训练，使用基于高斯的奖励支持连续分数预测，并加入标准差过滤和熵门控机制来稳定训练。

Result: 在三个关键图像质量评估任务上进行评估：美学质量评估、技术质量评估和图文对齐。

Conclusion: 该框架能够将多维度推理转化为连续可解释的奖励信号，并通过稳定化技术提高训练稳定性和下游泛化能力。

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

*Zhaolin Hu,Kun Li,Hehe Fan,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强线性注意力机制的新混合框架，通过添加门控局部图网络分支和可学习的对数幂函数，提高注意力图的秩并锐化注意力分布，解决了现有线性注意力模型表达能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有线性注意力模型由于低秩投影结构和过于均匀的注意力分布，导致表达能力显著下降，限制了节点表示的类别可分性和分类能力。

Method: 提出混合框架：1）在值矩阵上附加门控局部图网络分支以增加注意力图的秩；2）引入可学习的对数幂函数到注意力分数中，降低熵并锐化注意力焦点。

Result: 理论证明该方法能降低注意力分布的熵，增强学习嵌入的可分性。在多种图基准测试中实现了有竞争力的性能，同时保持了线性注意力的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了线性注意力模型的表达能力限制问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的音频驱动说话头生成方法在时间一致性和精细运动控制方面仍面临挑战，需要更好的解耦控制机制。

Method: 提出运动自编码器构建结构化潜在空间，使运动因子独立表示并近似正交化，在此基础上应用基于最优传输的流匹配和transformer预测器生成时间平滑的运动轨迹。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DEMO在视频真实感、唇音同步和运动保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 将精细运动解耦与基于流的生成建模相结合，为可控说话头视频合成提供了强大的新范式。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,
underlining our manual specification-free definition.

Conclusion: 时间稳定性应与准确性一起作为核心评估标准，这将推动更可靠的自动驾驶系统发展。将发布公开基准以鼓励更广泛地关注稳定性问题。

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at
https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

*Gaojian Wang,Feng Lin,Tong Wu,Zhisheng Yan,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FS-VFM是一个自监督预训练框架，通过3C学习目标（局部一致性、区域间连贯性、局部到全局对应关系）结合掩码图像建模和实例判别，学习真实人脸的基础表示，并在多种人脸安全任务中展现出色的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大量未标记的真实人脸数据，学习鲁棒且可迁移的人脸表示，以提升在各种人脸安全任务中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出FS-VFM框架，包含三种学习目标：使用CRFR-P掩码策略实现区域一致性和连贯性，结合掩码图像建模和实例判别，并通过FS-Adapter轻量适配器进行高效迁移。

Result: 在11个公共基准测试中，FS-VFM在跨数据集深度伪造检测、跨域人脸反欺骗和未见过的扩散人脸取证等任务中，始终优于各种视觉基础模型，甚至超越特定任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: FS-VFM能够学习到通用的人脸基础表示，在多种人脸安全任务中展现出卓越的泛化性能，FS-Adapter提供了优秀的效率-性能权衡。

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了视频生成模型在4D真实世界交互方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Conclusion: MSM-Seg框架通过有效整合多模态和切片间信息，结合类别无关提示，显著提高了脑肿瘤分割的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了从模糊单目视频中高质量动态高斯溅射的统一框架，在散焦和运动模糊处理上均表现出色

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We present WorldMirror, an all-in-one, feed-forward model for versatile 3D
geometric prediction tasks. Unlike existing methods constrained to image-only
inputs or customized for a specific task, our framework flexibly integrates
diverse geometric priors, including camera poses, intrinsics, and depth maps,
while simultaneously generating multiple 3D representations: dense point
clouds, multi-view depth maps, camera parameters, surface normals, and 3D
Gaussians. This elegant and unified architecture leverages available prior
information to resolve structural ambiguities and delivers geometrically
consistent 3D outputs in a single forward pass. WorldMirror achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks from camera, point map,
depth, and surface normal estimation to novel view synthesis, while maintaining
the efficiency of feed-forward inference. Code and models will be publicly
available soon.

*Yuan Xu,Zimu Zhang,Xiaoxuan Ma,Wentao Zhu,Yu Qiao,Yizhou Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层意图感知框架，通过认知机制建模人类意图并预测详细的情境行为，使用动态图卷积网络捕捉人-环境关系，在VR/AR系统中实现智能行为预测和环境自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟和增强现实系统需要智能适应用户行为以增强交互体验，这需要准确理解人类意图和预测未来情境行为（如注视方向和物体交互），但现有方法缺乏对驱动人-环境交互的底层认知过程的建模。

Method: 提出分层意图感知框架，基于历史人类动态和场景上下文，首先识别潜在交互目标，然后预测细粒度未来行为；使用动态图卷积网络（GCN）有效捕捉人-环境关系。

Result: 在具有挑战性的真实世界基准测试和实时VR环境中进行了广泛实验，在所有指标上实现了优越性能，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现主动式VR系统，预测用户行为并相应调整虚拟环境，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

*Laura Weihl,Nejc Novak,Stefan H. Bengtson,Malte Pedersen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了AURA数据集，这是首个用于水下视觉异常检测的多标注者基准数据集，评估了四种VAD模型在两种海洋场景中的表现，强调了稳健帧选择策略的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下视频监测是评估海洋生物多样性的有前景策略，但大量无事件视频使得人工检查非常不切实际，需要自动识别有趣或异常事件的方法。

Method: 使用基于深度神经网络的水下视觉异常检测(VAD)，引入AURA多标注者基准数据集，评估四种VAD模型，并采用稳健的帧选择策略提取有意义的视频片段。

Result: 当前VAD模型的性能差异很大，对训练数据量和定义"正常"场景的视觉内容变异性高度敏感。与多标注者比较显示，软标签和共识标签具有重要价值。

Conclusion: 研究结果为支持科学探索和可扩展的生物多样性监测提供了实用方法，强调了VAD在水下视频分析中的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部补丁相似性的人脸相似度度量方法，该方法通过将全局相似度分解为受限感受野的贡献来提供可解释性，无需依赖后处理分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏可靠的评估指标，现有后处理方法对模型实际推理的保真度存在不确定性，因此需要设计决策过程本身可解释的模型。

Method: 将两张人脸图像的相似度定义为补丁级相似度得分的总和，通过分解全局相似度为受限感受野的贡献来提供局部可加性解释。

Result: 在112x112人脸图像中使用28x28补丁时达到竞争性的验证性能，使用56x56补丁时超越了最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种内在可解释的人脸相似度度量，通过局部补丁分解实现了良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Abstract: Identifying drones and birds correctly is essential for keeping the skies
safe and improving security systems. Using the VIP CUP 2025 dataset, which
provides both RGB and infrared (IR) images, this study presents EGD-YOLOv8n, a
new lightweight yet powerful model for object detection. The model improves how
image features are captured and understood, making detection more accurate and
efficient. It uses smart design changes and attention layers to focus on
important details while reducing the amount of computation needed. A special
detection head helps the model adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes.
We trained three versions: one using RGB images, one using IR images, and one
combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability
while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的2.5D方法，将3D胸部CT表示为结构化图，通过谱图卷积处理轴向切片三元组，在保持临床部署兼容性的同时捕获切片间依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT检查量的增长，需要自动化工具支持放射科医生。现有3D CNN方法难以捕获长程依赖，而视觉Transformer需要大量领域特定预训练。

Method: 将3D CT体积表示为结构化图，轴向切片三元组作为节点，通过谱图卷积处理，能够推理切片间依赖关系。

Result: 在3个独立机构的数据集上训练和评估，实现了强大的跨数据集泛化能力，与最先进的视觉编码器相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持临床部署复杂度的同时，有效解决了3D胸部CT多标签分类的挑战，并展示了在放射学报告生成和腹部CT数据上的广泛适用性。

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

TL;DR: 提出DISC-GAN框架，通过风格-内容解耦和聚类特定训练策略实现逼真的水下图像合成，在SSIM、PSNR和FID指标上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下图像合成中由于颜色衰减和浑浊等光学现象导致的风格变化问题，传统生成模型难以建模不同水下环境的非均匀条件。

Method: 使用K-means聚类将数据集划分为风格特定域，采用分离的编码器获取风格和内容的潜在空间，通过AdaIN集成这些表示并解码生成最终图像，在每个风格簇上独立训练以保持域特定特征。

Result: 获得SSIM 0.9012、PSNR 32.5118 dB和FID 13.3728的优异性能，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: DISC-GAN框架成功实现了水下图像的逼真合成，通过风格-内容解耦和聚类特定训练有效解决了水下环境多样性带来的挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出imHead，一种新型隐式3D可变形模型，能够建模表达性3D头部头像并支持面部特征的局部编辑，通过引入区域特定的潜在表示实现局部编辑，同时保持紧凑的身份空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D可变形模型受限于严格拓扑结构和线性特性，难以表示复杂的全头形状。现有方法将潜在空间划分为局部组件，导致潜在维度庞大且昂贵。

Method: 保留单一紧凑身份空间，引入中间区域特定潜在表示来支持局部编辑。使用大规模4K身份数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验证明该模型在表示多样化身份和表情方面具有更强的表达能力，优于先前方法，并提供可解释的3D面部操作解决方案。

Conclusion: imHead成功解决了传统3DMM的局限性，通过隐式函数和局部编辑机制实现了更高质量的3D头部建模和编辑。

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的公开分割标注对图像处理领域至关重要，特别是体积图像的大量目标标注耗时且具有挑战性。

Method: 三位不同标注者对Cell Tracking Challenge中的两个MDA231细胞序列进行了完整的3D时间序列分割标注。

Result: 创建的标注与CTC发布的追踪标记一致，分割精度在标注者间变异范围内，且比CTC自动生成的银标准更好地反映了输入图像的复杂性。

Conclusion: 该标注数据集可用于细胞分割的测试和训练，以及高度动态物体的3D形状分析。

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在提高胸部X光诊断准确性的同时，存在在不同人口群体间性能差异的风险，可能加剧医疗保健不平等。

Method: 扩展CNN-XGBoost管道以支持多标签分类，将CNN最后一层替换为XGBoost分类器，并比较了对抗训练、重加权、数据增强和主动学习等传统偏见缓解技术。

Result: 该方法在不同骨干网络（DenseNet-121和ResNet-50）上均表现出强大的性能和公平性结果，与主动学习结合时在所有人口亚组中实现了最大的偏见减少。

Conclusion: XGBoost重训练与主动学习相结合为临床放射学中公平的深度学习部署提供了实用有效的路径，以较低计算成本实现了竞争性的偏见减少效果。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Motivation: 现有基于transformer的3D人体网格恢复模型计算成本高、复杂度大，存在深度transformer架构和冗余令牌问题

Method: ECLM选择性合并对MPJPE影响最小的transformer层；Mask-ToMe专注于合并对预测贡献小的背景令牌；使用扩散解码器整合时序上下文和姿态先验

Result: 在多个基准测试中，方法实现最高2.3倍加速，同时性能略有提升

Conclusion: 提出的合并策略和扩散解码器能有效降低计算成本，在保持甚至提升性能的同时显著加速3D人体网格恢复

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Conclusion: 通过合成数据补充和跨域语义对齐，有效解决了点云分割中的长尾问题。

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

Motivation: 当前VLMs在开放世界条件下的图像地理定位能力尚未得到全面评估，而这是一个具有实际需求且具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 构建EarthWhere基准，包含WhereCountry（500个多选问答）和WhereStreet（310个细粒度街道级识别任务），采用最终预测指标和中间推理链评分方法，包括基于Shapley重加权的思考分数。

Result: 评估13个最先进的VLMs，Gemini-2.5-Pro平均准确率最高（56.32%），最强开源模型GLM-4.5V达到34.71%。发现网络搜索和推理在视觉线索有限时不能保证性能提升，模型存在区域偏见（某些区域得分比其他区域高42.7%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs在地理定位方面的潜力和挑战，特别是在减少偏见和实现稳健细粒度定位方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

Motivation: 现有的对比视觉语言模型在多语言场景下存在偏差，主要因为缺乏多语言多模态数据。虽然近期多语言扩展方法缓解了这个问题，但它们只关注实例级对齐，忽略了共享嵌入空间的全局几何结构。

Method: 提出ToMCLIP框架，应用持久同调定义拓扑对齐损失，并使用图稀疏化策略来近似持久图，同时提供理论误差界限。

Result: 实验验证显示该方法增强了多语言表示的结构一致性，在CIFAR-100上获得更高的零样本准确率，在xFlickr&CO上实现更强的多语言检索性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅适用于视觉语言模型，还为表示学习提供了一个通用的拓扑对齐方法。

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

*Honghui Yuan,Keiji Yanai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneTextStylizer是一个无需训练的扩散模型框架，用于在场景图像中实现灵活、高保真的文本风格迁移，支持提示词引导的文本区域风格转换，同时保持文本可读性和风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决场景文本编辑中灵活和局部化风格迁移的挑战，现有方法通常局限于内容替换和简单风格，缺乏自由风格迁移能力。

Method: 设计特征注入模块利用扩散模型反演和自注意力机制有效传递风格特征；引入区域控制机制通过基于距离的变化掩码实现精确空间控制；基于傅里叶变换的风格增强模块增强风格丰富度。

Result: 在场景文本风格转换方面表现出色，在视觉保真度和文本保持方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的SceneTextStylizer框架成功解决了场景文本灵活风格迁移的挑战，实现了高质量的风格转换效果。

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing.
DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial
structure and identity while enabling extensive customization through various
conditioning inputs such as reference images, specific RGB colors, and textual

color-matching capabilities, identity preservation and compatibility with
textual descriptions or LLMs with affordable computational costs.

TL;DR: FG-CLIP 2是一个双语视觉语言模型，通过细粒度监督和文本模态内对比损失，在英中双语环境下实现了先进的细粒度对齐能力，并在29个数据集上达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在细粒度理解方面存在局限，特别是在非英语环境下，难以准确捕捉对象属性、空间关系和语言表达的细微差别，且双语理解能力有限。

Method: 采用区域文本匹配、长文本建模等多重判别目标，引入文本模态内对比损失来区分语义相似的描述，并在大规模英中双语数据上进行训练。

Result: 在29个数据集上的广泛实验表明，FG-CLIP 2在8个任务中超越了现有方法，在英中双语环境下均达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2通过创新的细粒度监督机制和双语训练策略，显著提升了视觉语言模型的细粒度对齐能力，为双语多模态理解研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纹理缺失物体6D姿态估计中深度信息缺失的问题，当前多视角方法要么依赖深度数据，要么未能充分利用多视角几何线索。

Method: 设计三阶段渐进姿态优化策略，利用密集多视角关键点几何信息；通过注意力聚合和对称感知训练增强关键点网络，实现有效的密集关键点融合。

Result: 在ROBI数据集上的广泛实验表明，DKPMV优于最先进的多视角RGB方法，在大多数情况下甚至超越RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: 提出的DKPMV管道仅使用RGB图像就能实现高质量的6D姿态估计，为工业机器人应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需校准的实例级不确定性指标，用于检测生成模型在逆问题重建中的分布偏移，通过重建稳定性来识别超出训练分布的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型作为数据驱动先验在逆问题中表现良好，但存在对超出训练分布的图像产生幻觉特征的风险。现有不确定性量化方法需要校准数据集或仅提供启发式估计，无法有效处理分布偏移问题。

Method: 基于重建稳定性假设：在分布内图像的重建对随机测量变化保持稳定，而超出分布图像的重建则表现出更大不稳定性。通过计算重建变异性作为分布偏移的代理指标。

Result: 在MNIST数字的断层重建实验中，仅使用数字"0"训练的模型评估所有十个数字时，超出分布数字的重建显示出更高的变异性和重建误差，验证了该指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成先验提供了轻量级防护机制，可在分布内情况下实现激进的测量减少，同时自动警告超出分布的应用场景。

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IUT-Plug是一个基于图像理解树(IUT)的模块，通过显式结构化推理增强现有交错视觉语言模型，解决逻辑、实体身份和风格方面的上下文漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在生成多模态图像-文本时难以保持逻辑、对象身份和风格的一致性，这限制了它们在复杂图像-文本输入输出场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：(1)动态IUT-Plug提取模块将视觉场景解析为层次化符号结构；(2)协调的叙事流和图像合成机制确保跨模态一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，IUT-Plug不仅提高了在现有基准测试上的准确性，还能有效缓解三种关键形式的上下文漂移，在多样化多模态问答场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: IUT-Plug通过显式结构化推理成功解决了视觉语言模型中的上下文漂移问题，为复杂多模态场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图表推理任务上表现优异，但在分布外数据上表现不佳，且生成思维链时性能进一步下降，限制了可解释性。

Method: 使用GRPO结合三种自动可验证奖励进行微调：正确图表类型分类、忠实图表表格重建和过程一致性。

Result: 在30亿参数模型上，Chart-RVR在分布内和分布外数据集上均优于标准监督微调，在六个图表推理基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: Chart-RVR通过可验证奖励和GRPO训练出了更可靠、可解释的图表推理模型，提高了思维链的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

Motivation: 多模态模型容易过度拟合强模态，导致弱模态贡献被抑制，需要解决模态不平衡问题以提升多模态理解性能。

Method: 首先提出MM方法在多模态特征层面应用Mixup策略生成虚拟特征-标签对；进一步提出B-MM方法根据各模态对学习目标的相对贡献动态调整混合比例。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明，所提方法能有效提升泛化能力和多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过特征层面的混合策略和动态平衡机制，可以有效缓解多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

Motivation: 基础模型在复杂低对比度背景下的医学图像分割中表现不佳，特别是当恶性肿瘤与正常组织相似时，难以进行上下文区分，需要专门的方法来增强前景关注和边界识别。

Method: 1) 前景感知模块放大背景与整个体积空间的区别；2) 基于小波变换的特征级频率增强模块提取判别性高频特征；3) 边缘约束模块保持分割边界的几何连续性。

Conclusion: FASS框架显著增强了低对比度图像的分割能力，为更复杂多样的医学成像场景应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的框架，分别学习视频人体姿态估计中的全局和局部高分辨率时空表示，通过全局时空Mamba和局部细化Mamba实现高效建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VHPE方法难以平衡全局动态上下文和局部运动细节的建模，且存在二次复杂度问题。Mamba模型在长距离上下文建模方面有潜力但仅限于1D数据。

Method: 提出全局时空Mamba进行6D选择性时空扫描和空间-时间调制扫描合并，以及基于窗口时空扫描的局部细化Mamba来增强局部关键点运动的高频细节。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，该模型优于最先进的VHPE方法，同时实现了更好的计算权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架成功扩展了Mamba用于VHPE，能够有效分离学习全局和局部高分辨率时空表示，在性能和计算效率方面都取得了优势。

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

*Shasha Guo,Liang Pang,Xi Wang,Yanling Wang,Huawei Shen,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GeoVLMath模型，通过文本描述辅助线构造而非直接编辑图像，使用强化学习框架提升图文对齐，在几何辅助线推理任务上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在解决复杂几何问题时，辅助线的绘制具有挑战性，直接编辑图像难以保证几何精度，而文本描述更适合模型处理

Method: 提出强化学习框架，使用跨模态奖励评估生成的辅助线描述与真实辅助线图的对齐程度，基于GRPO的强化学习阶段实现精确的图文对齐

Result: 构建了AuxSolidMath数据集（3,018个真实考试几何问题），GeoVLMath在3B和7B规模上在辅助线推理基准测试中表现优于开源和专有LVLM模型

Conclusion: 文本描述辅助线构造比直接图像编辑更适合LVLMs，强化学习框架能有效提升图文对齐，GeoVLMath在几何辅助线推理任务上取得优异性能

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: GIR-Bench是一个全面的多模态基准测试，从三个互补角度评估统一模型的理解-生成一致性、推理驱动的文本到图像生成以及多步推理编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统评估多模态模型理解与生成对齐及其在复杂视觉任务中泛化潜力的严谨基准测试。

Method: 设计了三个子集：理解-生成一致性评估（UGC）、推理驱动的文本到图像生成（T2I）和多步推理编辑（Edit），每个子集都有专门定制的评估流程。

Result: 统一模型在推理驱动的视觉任务上表现更好，但理解与生成之间仍存在持续差距。

Conclusion: GIR-Bench为系统评估多模态模型提供了全面框架，揭示了当前模型在理解与生成对齐方面的局限性。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段框架用于工业异常检测中的零样本异常分割，通过CLIP和SAM的协同使用，解决了SAM倾向于分割整个对象而非异常区域的问题，并在多个数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在零样本异常分割任务中展现出强大的泛化能力，但如何正确引导这些模型解决下游任务仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1) Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG)模块，利用CLIP和SAM生成正负点提示，引导SAM专注于分割异常区域；2) Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS)模块，使用混合提示与SAM的轻量级解码器级联，优化分割结果。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法的有效性，在Visa数据集上，F1-max和AP指标分别比最先进方法提高了10.3%和7.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了SAM在异常分割中的局限性，实现了精确的异常区域分割，在零样本异常分割任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

Motivation: 喉癌影像研究缺乏标准化数据集来支持可复现的深度学习模型开发。

Method: 从TCIA收集6个数据集的CT扫描，使用弱监督参数搜索框架提取喉部感兴趣区域，并评估多种3D深度学习架构（3D CNN、ResNet18/50/101、DenseNet121）在早期vs晚期和T4 vs非T4分类任务上的性能。

Result: 3D CNN在早期vs晚期分类任务中表现最佳（AUC-0.881，F1-macro-0.821），ResNet18在T4 vs非T4分类任务中表现最佳（AUC-0.892，F1-macro-0.646）。3D GradCAM分析显示模型在非T4病例中更关注软骨周围区域，在T4预测中显示局部激活。

Conclusion: LaryngealCT通过开源数据、预训练模型和集成可解释性工具，为AI驱动的喉癌研究提供了可复现的基础，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations
in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated
explainability tools, LaryngealCT offers a reproducible foundation for
AI-driven research to support clinical decisions in laryngeal oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本引导扩散模型在人脸编辑任务中难以同时保持身份和结构一致性，需要解决这一限制。

Method: 将人脸表示分解为ID和属性特征，作为反演和反向扩散过程的联合条件，实现ID和属性的独立控制。

Result: 方法支持仅使用文本提示的复杂多属性人脸编辑，无需区域特定输入，速度与DDIM反演相当，实验证明其有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持身份一致性和结构一致性的同时，实现了精确的面部属性编辑，为文本引导的人脸编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Conclusion: FRANCK能够有效将源域预训练的DETR模型适配到目标域，具有增强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶方法通常采用一次性范式，过度依赖当前场景上下文，低估了场景动态及其时间演化的重要性，限制了在复杂驾驶场景中做出自适应决策的能力。

Method: 提出SeerDrive框架，首先预测未来鸟瞰图表示以预判周围场景动态，然后利用这种前瞻性生成未来上下文感知的轨迹。关键组件包括未来感知规划和迭代场景建模与车辆规划。

Result: 在NAVSIM和nuScenes基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SeerDrive显著优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 自动驾驶车辆的未来轨迹与其环境的演化动态密切相关，双向关系建模能够提升决策的适应性和准确性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 监督扩散去噪方法为多模态防御提供了有效解决方案，有助于多模态大语言模型在现实应用中的可靠和安全部署。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

*Ans Munir,Faisal Z. Qureshi,Mohsen Ali,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这是第一篇专门针对组合零样本学习（CZSL）的全面综述，系统回顾了最先进的CZSL方法，提出了基于解缠的分类法，并分析了不同问题设置下的方法优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合零样本学习是计算机视觉中的重要任务，能够识别已知属性和对象在推理时的未见组合，解决需要为所有可能组合提供训练数据的组合挑战。由于原始特征的视觉外观具有高度上下文依赖性，有效建模这种上下文性和内在组合性对于稳健的组合零样本识别至关重要。

Method: 提出了基于解缠的分类法，将方法分为四个类别：无显式解缠、文本解缠、视觉解缠和跨模态解缠。对现有方法进行了详细的比较分析，强调了在不同问题设置（如封闭世界和开放世界CZSL）中的核心优势和局限性。

Result: 系统回顾了最先进的CZSL方法，提供了全面的比较分析，识别了重要的开放挑战，并概述了有前景的未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 这篇综述旨在作为基础资源，指导和启发这一重要领域进一步的发展。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从真实视频中学习3D运动先验的方法，使用像素对齐的运动图表示，通过扩散模型生成语义一致的3D场景运动预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单张输入图像预测未来3D场景运动的挑战，需要学习语义和功能上有意义的3D运动先验。

Method: 提出像素对齐的运动图表示，从5万多个真实视频创建大规模MoMap数据库，训练扩散模型进行运动生成，并建立新的2D视频合成流程。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能生成合理且语义一致的3D场景运动。

Conclusion: MoMap表示和扩散模型结合能有效学习3D运动先验，为3D运动预测和2D视频合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

*Chen Liu,Wenfang Yao,Kejing Yin,William K. Cheung,Jing Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPro框架通过区域感知解耦和多时间尺度对齐，解决纵向多模态数据中CXR序列冗余和与EHR数据时间不对齐的问题，在疾病进展识别和ICU预测任务上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向多模态数据（如EHR和连续CXR）在疾病进展建模中未充分利用，主要面临两个挑战：连续CXR序列中的冗余（静态解剖区域主导临床有意义动态）以及稀疏、不规则成像与连续EHR数据之间的时间不对齐。

Method: 1. 在连续CXR中解耦静态（解剖）和动态（病理进展）特征，优先考虑疾病相关变化；2. 通过局部（成对区间级）和全局（全序列）同步，层次化对齐这些静态和动态CXR特征与异步EHR数据，以建模连贯的进展路径。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的广泛实验表明，DiPro能有效提取时间临床动态，在疾病进展识别和一般ICU预测任务上均达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DiPro框架成功解决了纵向多模态数据集成中的关键挑战，为疾病进展建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中难以准确遵循计数指令，研究发现单纯扩大模型和数据规模无法解决计数问题，提出通过向噪声先验注入计数感知布局信息的方法显著提升了计数准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型是否能够通过扩大数据集和模型规模来准确生成文本提示中指定的对象数量，因为现有模型在计数任务上表现不佳。

Method: 构建了两个合成数据集进行评测，发现缩放假设不成立，提出通过向噪声先验注入计数感知布局信息来控制对象数量的方法。

Result: 提出的方法在GrayCount250数据集上准确率从20.0%提升到85.3%，在NaturalCount6数据集上从74.8%提升到86.3%。

Conclusion: 扩散模型计数问题不能仅通过扩大规模解决，噪声先验存在计数偏差，通过注入计数感知布局信息可有效控制对象数量生成。

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了video-SALMONN S，首个能在固定内存预算下处理3小时视频（1FPS，360p分辨率）的流式视听LLM，通过测试时训练内存模块和提示相关内存读取器实现长视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解LLM难以扩展处理长视频流，离线方法需要调整帧率，流式方法会丢失信息。需要开发能持续处理长视频且不丢失信息的解决方案。

Method: 引入测试时训练(TTT)内存模块持续更新token表示来捕获长程依赖，替代token合并；使用提示相关内存读取器从固定大小内存中选择性检索相关内容；采用Hessian-free共轭梯度优化TTT模块。

Result: 在长视频基准测试(Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro)上，模型能维持高质量理解，处理多达10k帧和1M token的3小时视频。8B参数模型在Video-MME长分割上达到74.2%总体和67.8%的准确率，优于离线和流式基线。

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S是首个能在固定内存预算下处理多小时视频的流式视听LLM，通过创新的内存管理机制解决了长视频处理的扩展性问题。

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统精液分析无法评估精子DNA碎片化(SDF)，而SDF是男性生育能力评估的关键参数，需要开发非破坏性、实时的检测方法用于生殖医学临床应用。

Method: 提出形态学辅助的集成AI模型，结合图像处理技术和基于transformer的机器学习模型(GC-ViT)，从相位对比图像预测精子DNA碎片化，并与纯视觉transformer模型和仅形态学模型进行基准比较。

Result: 该框架能够达到60%的敏感性和75%的特异性，显示出有前景的结果。

Conclusion: 这种非破坏性方法代表了生殖医学的重要进展，能够基于DNA完整性实现实时精子选择，适用于临床诊断和治疗应用。

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MMEFnet方法，通过多流形证据融合有效整合PolSAR协方差矩阵和多特征，解决传统方法忽略流形差异和不确定性的问题，实现更可靠可解释的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PolSAR特征融合方法通常简单拼接特征或使用深度学习网络，但忽略了协方差矩阵和多特征位于不同流形上的几何结构差异，且未考虑不同视图的重要性差异和不确定性，导致预测不可靠。

Method: 将协方差矩阵建模在Hermitian正定流形上，多特征建模在Grassmann流形上，构建两个不同的核度量学习网络学习流形表示，然后使用可信多视图证据融合估计各视图的置信质量和不确定性，最后基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合证据。

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMEFnet成功将PolSAR流形学习和证据融合整合到统一架构中，实现了更可靠和可解释的PolSAR图像分类。

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

*Xiang Ma,Litian Xu,Lexin Fang,Caiming Zhang,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO是一个新颖的跨模态对齐框架，通过抑制风格信息干扰来提升语义对齐效果，使用特征列语义概率加权和原型迭代构建方法，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态对齐方法假设嵌入仅包含语义信息，忽略了风格信息等非语义信息的干扰，导致信息偏差或丢失。需要将风格与语义分离，仅对齐语义信息。

Method: 提出PICO框架：1）量化每个特征列表示语义信息的概率，作为嵌入交互的权重；2）提出基于性能反馈加权的原型迭代构建方法，确保语义概率的可靠性。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型骨干上的广泛实验表明，PICO优于最先进方法5.2%-14.1%。

Conclusion: PICO通过有效抑制风格干扰，显著提升了跨模态对齐性能，理论证明其加权函数能为带来更高性能提升的原型分配更高权重。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

Motivation: 解决千亿级病理基础模型在开发和部署中的巨大计算成本问题，寻求在保持高性能的同时降低计算负担的方法。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术，将千亿级教师模型的能力转移到仅含15%参数的大型学生模型上，仅需1000张目标癌症病理切片进行训练。

Result: 蒸馏后的大型模型不仅超越了同规模的最先进模型，在某些基准测试中甚至超过了千亿级教师模型和更大规模模型，并表现出更高的鲁棒性指数。

Conclusion: 该蒸馏方法是一种数据和参数高效的方式，可在不产生过高计算负担的情况下，为癌症特定应用实现千亿级性能水平。

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis是一个多模态、多文化基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在日常文化知识方面的鲁棒性，涵盖语言改写和视觉模态，揭示了当前模型在文化理解上的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在全球部署，评估其对文化情境知识的理解能力变得至关重要，而现有评估主要关注静态回忆或孤立视觉基础，未能测试模型的鲁棒性和可迁移文化理解。

Method: 基于BLEnD数据集构建了313个文化基础问题模板，涵盖16个地区，生成三种对齐的多选题格式：文本基线、倒置文本变体和VQA风格的图像版本，包含4,916张图像和21,000多个多选题实例。

Result: BLEnD-Vis揭示了当前VLM文化知识的显著脆弱性；模型在语言改写下表现下降，虽然视觉线索通常有助于性能，但低跨模态一致性突显了在稳健整合文本和视觉理解方面的挑战，特别是对于资源较少的地区。

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis为系统分析文化鲁棒性和多模态基础提供了关键测试平台，暴露了局限性并指导开发更具文化能力的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our
code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

TL;DR: 提出了FlexAC框架，通过调节多模态大语言模型的联想推理强度，在保持性和创造性之间实现灵活平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏调节联想推理强度的灵活性，限制了MLLMs在事实性和创造性场景中的适应性。

Method: 通过分析MLLMs内部机制，发现中间层对联想倾向起关键作用，利用幻觉引导构建联想导向向量，并自适应校准强度以实现平衡。

Result: 在Creation-MMBench上创造力提升5.8倍，在CHAIR上幻觉率降低29%，超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FlexAC框架有效实现了对MLLMs联想推理的灵活控制，在保持性和创造性任务中均表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 该研究证明仅通过面部表情的动态成分就能识别个人身份，无需依赖静态面部特征。使用FLAME 3D模型分离面部形状和表情动态，在1,429人的对话视频数据集上达到61.14%的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索面部表情动态是否包含独特的个人身份特征，独立于静态面部外观。

Method: 使用FLAME 3D可变形模型分离面部形状和表情动态参数，仅保留表情和下颌系数。采用Conformer模型和监督对比学习进行1,429路分类。

Result: 在CANDOR数据集上达到61.14%的识别准确率（458倍于随机猜测）。引入漂移噪声比(DNR)量化形状-表情分离的可靠性，发现DNR与识别性能呈强负相关。

Conclusion: 面部动态携带强烈的个人身份特征，这种发现对社会感知和临床评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

Motivation: 当前医学图像分割方法在结构表示和上下文建模方面存在不足，影响在复杂临床场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 使用STR模块将多尺度语义特征重组为动态超图以建模跨分辨率解剖依赖关系，EPG模块通过扰动评估通道稳定性并过滤高熵通道来增强空间注意力。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了优越的分割精度和更好的跨临床场景泛化能力。

Conclusion: DTEA模型通过改进的跳跃连接框架有效提升了医学图像分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy
and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is

Conclusion: 基于LLM代理的自动化方法显著提高了SEM图像尺度条检测和提取的效率和准确性，为显微分析和科学成像领域提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类器编辑方法要么局限于错误修正，要么需要大量重新训练成本，缺乏灵活性，特别是在图像分类中的编辑研究有限。

Method: 引入Class Vectors概念，在微调过程中捕获类别特定的表示调整。通过将潜在特征沿这些向量引导或映射到权重空间来更新决策边界，利用Class Vectors的线性和正交性支持高效的类别算术编辑。

Result: Class Vectors能够捕获每个类别的语义偏移，支持高效的分类器编辑，在类别遗忘、环境适应、对抗防御和对抗触发优化等应用中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Class Vectors提供了一种灵活高效的图像分类器编辑方法，克服了传统方法的局限性，为分类器的后训练调整开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion

enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness. Tests on datasets like ISIC2018
confirm EEMS's superior performance and reliability as a clinical tool.

TL;DR: HaDola是一个人类不确定性感知的数据选择和自动标注框架，通过四阶段迭代方法减少对昂贵人工标注的依赖，使视觉语言模型更准确且校准更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集常存在人类不确定性，但标准监督微调仅优化最频繁标签，忽略了不确定性分布。需要研究人类不确定性如何影响SFT以及如何在训练中有效利用它。

Method: HaDola框架包含四个阶段：区分、自标注、错误触发和训练，通过迭代识别有害样本、优先选择信息丰富的样本，并从5%的小种子集进行引导。

Result: 在VQAv2和VizWiz数据集上的广泛实验表明，HaDola使用更少的训练数据就能持续匹配或超越最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 在监督微调中显式建模人类不确定性比单纯扩大数据集规模更有效，更好地利用不确定性比增加数据量更重要。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在实际应用中会遇到分布内数据和分布外数据，其中OOD数据包含协变量偏移和语义偏移。需要提升模型对协变量偏移OOD数据的泛化能力，同时有效检测开放集语义偏移的OOD类别。

Method: 基于视觉-语言模态重新对齐时观察到的显著能量变化，提出ΔEnergy OOD评分方法，并通过下界最大化(EBM)来同时改善OOD检测和泛化能力。

Result: 在具有挑战性的OOD检测和泛化基准测试中表现出色，AUROC指标比现有方法提升10%到25%。

Conclusion: ΔEnergy提供了一种更可靠的OOD检测方法，EBM框架能够统一提升视觉语言模型在OOD泛化和检测方面的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

Motivation: 传统的监督检测需要大量标注成本，而零样本VLM检测无需标注但精度较低，需要进行全面的成本效益分析来指导架构选择。

Method: 在1000张分层COCO图像和200张多样化产品图像上进行系统评估，结合详细的总拥有成本建模，比较YOLO和Gemini的准确性和成本。

Result: 监督YOLO在标准类别上准确率91.2%，零样本Gemini为68.5%，但Gemini在多样化产品类别上准确率52.3%（YOLO为0%）。监督检测仅在超过5500万次推理时才值得投资。

Conclusion: 最优架构选择取决于部署量、类别稳定性、预算约束和精度要求，而非纯粹的技术性能指标。

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

Motivation: 基于草图的3D重建面临挑战，因为草图输入抽象稀疏，缺乏足够的语义和几何信息

Method: 两阶段生成方法：1) 通过草图到图像转换进行语义桥接，丰富稀疏草图表示；2) 引入对称约束作为几何先验，利用日常物体的结构规律性

Result: 在主流草图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Chamfer距离、Earth Mover距离和F-Score指标上优于现有方法

Conclusion: 验证了所提出的语义桥接和对称感知设计的有效性

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了SAR影像洪水制图和水深估计的预处理、制图方法和参数选择的影响，强调采用集成方法处理整个处理流程中的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水制图和水深估计对水文模型校准验证至关重要，但现有方法在预处理、制图方法和参数选择方面存在不确定性，需要系统评估这些因素对结果的影响。

Method: 使用SAR影像，通过集成预处理图像、洪水图和水深场，评估不同预处理（特别是斑点噪声抑制）、洪水制图和水深估计方法及其超参数的影响。在法国加龙河2019和2021年两次洪水事件上进行验证，以水动力模拟和现场观测为参考数据。

Result: 斑点滤波器的选择使洪水范围估计变化达数平方公里；监督方法优于无监督方法，但调优的无监督方法（如局部阈值或变化检测）可达到相似效果；预处理和洪水制图步骤的复合不确定性导致水深场估计高度可变。

Conclusion: 必须考虑包含预处理、洪水制图和水深估计方法及其超参数的整个处理流程，应采用集成方法而非单一配置，并考虑方法学不确定性。洪水制图中方法选择影响最大，水深估计中最有影响的是洪水制图步骤产生的洪水图输入和方法超参数。

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

Abstract: Interactive 3D scenes are increasingly vital for embodied intelligence, yet
existing datasets remain limited due to the labor-intensive process of
annotating part segmentation, kinematic types, and motion trajectories. We
present REACT3D, a scalable zero-shot framework that converts static 3D scenes
into simulation-ready interactive replicas with consistent geometry, enabling
direct use in diverse downstream tasks. Our contributions include: (i)
openable-object detection and segmentation to extract candidate movable parts
from static scenes, (ii) articulation estimation that infers joint types and
motion parameters, (iii) hidden-geometry completion followed by interactive
object assembly, and (iv) interactive scene integration in widely supported
formats to ensure compatibility with standard simulation platforms. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on detection/segmentation and articulation metrics
across diverse indoor scenes, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework
and providing a practical foundation for scalable interactive scene generation,
thereby lowering the barrier to large-scale research on articulated scene

Motivation: 解决SVG建模面临的碎片化数据集、方法跨任务迁移性差以及处理结构复杂性困难等问题，利用多模态大语言模型的强大迁移和泛化能力。

Method: 构建SAgoge数据集（最大最全面的SVG多模态数据集），建立SArena基准，开发InternSVG模型（使用SVG特定标记、子词嵌入初始化和两阶段训练策略）。

Result: 在SArena和现有基准测试中，InternSVG相比领先的开源和专有模型都取得了显著优势，实现了性能的大幅提升。

Conclusion: 通过统一建模框架实现了SVG任务的正向迁移，证明了多模态大语言模型在SVG理解、编辑和生成任务中的有效性。

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

TL;DR: 提出MMAP框架，通过多放大倍率补丁表示和原型嵌入，从H&E染色全玻片图像预测空间基因表达，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学结合组织图像预测基因表达存在模态差距大、局部特征粒度不足和全局空间上下文覆盖不充分的问题。

Method: MMAP框架：1) 使用多放大倍率补丁表示增强局部特征粒度；2) 学习潜在原型嵌入作为玻片级信息的紧凑表示，改善全局上下文理解。

Result: 在多个评估指标（MAE、MSE、PCC）上，MMAP始终优于所有现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MMAP通过同时解决局部特征粒度和全局空间上下文问题，成功提升了从组织学图像预测空间基因表达的性能。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

*Joshua Niemeijer,Jan Ehrhardt,Heinz Handels,Hristina Uzunova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种在ControlNet中引入不确定性控制的方法，利用未标注域数据训练ControlNet，生成目标域的高不确定性标注数据，从而改善分割模型在域偏移场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ControlNet倾向于复现原始训练分布，数据增强效果有限。需要解决域偏移问题，特别是在视网膜OCT图像中，高质量Spectralis图像与低质量Home-OCT图像存在较大域差异。

Method: 在控制机制中引入不确定性概念，结合未标注数据集的不确定性控制和标注数据集的语义控制，训练能够生成目标域标注数据的ControlNet。

Result: 在视网膜OCT实验中，该方法显著改善了Home-OCT图像的分割结果，无需额外监督。在交通场景实验中也验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 不确定性引导方法能够处理任意域偏移，无需严格学习图像风格，优于传统风格迁移方法。

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

Conclusion: 通过直接对齐图像与可泛化文本表示，可以消除对推理过程的依赖，在保持泛化能力的同时显著提升效率，为IQA模型的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

Motivation: 现有方法在高斯泼溅中增强反射相关材质属性来实现基于物理的渲染，但在有限环境建模下材质推断缺乏足够约束，导致光照锯齿和泛化能力下降。

Method: 强制2D高斯在多视角下产生一致的材质图，通过跟踪不同视角的光度变化识别高反射区域作为反射强度项的强先验，并引入基于2DGS光线追踪的环境建模策略处理间接光照。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，该方法能够忠实地恢复光照和几何，在新视角合成中实现了最先进的渲染质量。

Conclusion: 多视角一致材质推断和基于物理的环境建模是学习准确反射的关键，该方法通过改进环境建模和材质推断约束，显著提升了高斯泼溅的反射渲染质量。

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出了DocReward文档奖励模型，专注于评估文档的结构和风格质量，解决了现有智能体工作流主要关注文本质量而忽视视觉结构和样式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的智能体工作流自动化主要关注文本质量，但忽视了视觉结构和样式对文档可读性和参与度的重要性。缺乏合适的奖励模型来指导智能体工作流生成具有更强结构和样式质量的文档。

Method: 构建了包含117K对文档的多领域数据集DocPair，涵盖32个领域和267种文档类型，每对文档内容相同但结构和样式不同。使用Bradley-Terry损失训练DocReward模型来评分文档，惩罚与标注排名矛盾的预测。

Result: DocReward在准确性上分别比GPT-4o和GPT-5高出30.6和19.4个百分点。在文档生成的外部评估中，DocReward获得了60.8%的胜率，显著高于GPT-5的37.7%。

Conclusion: DocReward在评估文档结构和样式质量方面优于现有基线模型，能够有效指导生成智能体产生更受人类偏好的文档。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

Conclusion: LM-EEC框架通过有效的特征融合和长期记忆机制，成功解决了自我-外部视角对应任务的核心挑战，为智能助手的精确视觉引导提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于AIS监控系统的局限性，通过非合作卫星图像和AIS数据融合来提升内河航道监控能力。

Method: 使用YOLO v11目标检测模型检测和表征船舶，包括船舶类型、驳船覆盖、运行状态、驳船数量和航行方向，开发了包含4,550个实例的标注数据集。

Result: 船舶分类F1分数95.8%，驳船覆盖检测F1分数91.6%，运行状态分类F1分数99.4%，方向性准确率93.8%，驳船计数平均绝对误差2.4艘，空间可转移性分析显示准确率高达98%。

Conclusion: 融合非合作卫星传感与AIS的方法是可行的，能够实现近实时船队盘点、支持异常检测，并为内河航道监控生成高质量数据。

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

Conclusion: 该方法通过紧密耦合退化建模与融合过程，有效解决了退化图像融合问题，为实际应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/VGDCFusion.

Conclusion: 所提出的视图对齐方法有效增强了3D高斯的几何表示能力，在保持高效渲染的同时显著提升了表面重建的准确性和多视图一致性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

TL;DR: Situat3DChange是一个大规模3D数据集，支持三种情境感知的变化理解任务，包含121K问答对、36K变化描述和17K重排指令，通过SCReasoner模型实现高效的点云比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D数据集和评估基准主要关注动态场景或动态情况的孤立研究，导致理解不完整。为了克服这些限制，需要开发能够全面理解环境动态变化的系统。

Method: 利用11K人类环境变化观察构建共享心智模型，结合自我中心和他者中心视角以及空间关系，使用LLM集成支持情境变化理解。提出SCReasoner，一种高效的3D MLLM方法，能够有效比较点云对，参数开销小且无需语言解码器的额外token。

Result: 在Situat3DChange任务上的综合评估显示了MLLMs在动态场景和情境理解方面的进展和局限性。数据扩展和跨域迁移实验证明了Situat3DChange作为MLLMs训练数据集的任务无关有效性。

Conclusion: Situat3DChange数据集和SCReasoner方法为动态环境理解提供了重要基础，推动了3D场景变化理解的发展，并为人类-AI协作中的共享情境意识建立了框架。

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

Motivation: 由于难以在生成过程中将物理正确性与视觉外观分离，准确评估视频扩散模型中的直觉物理理解能力仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 通过区分物理有效和不可能视频，使用去噪目标作为ELBO似然替代，在精心策划的有效-无效视频对数据集上进行评估。

Result: 提出的评估指标PPE与人类偏好强对齐，优于最先进的评估器基线。当前模型在复杂混沌动力学方面仍有困难，但随着模型容量和推理设置的扩展，物理理解能力呈现明显改善趋势。

Conclusion: LikePhys方法有效评估了视频扩散模型的直觉物理理解能力，揭示了模型设计和推理设置对物理理解的影响，并展示了随着模型扩展而改善的趋势。

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲人和低视力人群在极端或复杂环境中行走辅助的挑战，由于缺乏整体场景理解而难以实现安全导航。

Method: 构建mmWalk多模态数据集，集成多视角传感器和面向无障碍的特征，包含RGB、深度和语义模态的全景图像，并生成专门的视觉问答基准mmWalkVQA。

Result: 评估现有视觉语言模型在零样本和少样本设置下，发现在风险评估和导航任务上表现不佳。微调后的mmWalk模型在真实世界数据集上验证有效。

Conclusion: mmWalk数据集能够有效推进多模态行走辅助技术的发展，为盲人和低视力人群提供更好的户外导航支持。

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing
multi-modal walking assistance.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了DiT模型中的大规模激活现象，发现其负责局部细节合成，并提出了一种无需训练的自引导策略DG来增强细节保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型内部特征图中存在大规模激活现象，但其功能尚不明确，需要系统研究这些激活在视觉生成中的作用。

Method: 提出Detail Guidance (DG)策略，通过破坏大规模激活构建"细节缺陷"模型，并用其引导原始网络进行更高质量的细节合成，可与CFG无缝集成。

Result: 实验表明DG能持续提升各种预训练DiT模型（如SD3、SD3.5、Flux）的细粒度细节质量。

Conclusion: 大规模激活在DiT模型中主要控制局部细节合成，DG策略能有效利用这一特性提升生成图像的细节质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

TL;DR: 本文提出了ODI-Bench，一个专门用于全方位图像理解的基准测试，包含2000张高质量全方位图像和4000多个手动标注的问答对。实验表明当前多模态大语言模型在理解全方位图像方面仍有困难，作者进一步提出了Omni-CoT方法，通过思维链推理显著提升了模型在全方位环境中的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全方位图像提供完整的360x180度视角，广泛应用于VR、AR和具身智能应用。然而，多模态大语言模型在理解全方位图像捕捉的沉浸式环境方面的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 1) 构建ODI-Bench基准测试，包含2000张全方位图像和4000多个问答对，涵盖10个细粒度任务；2) 对20个代表性MLLM进行基准测试；3) 提出Omni-CoT方法，通过思维链推理结合文本信息和视觉线索来增强模型理解能力。

Result: 实验结果显示当前MLLM在捕捉全方位图像提供的沉浸式上下文方面仍然存在困难。Omni-CoT方法显著提升了MLLM在全方位环境中的理解能力。

Conclusion: 当前MLLM在全方位图像理解方面仍有局限，提出的Omni-CoT方法能够有效提升模型性能。ODI-Bench基准测试和代码将在发表后发布。

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

Motivation: 胸部X光分类任务资源密集，通常需要大量标注数据，基础模型虽能减少这种依赖，但具体需要多少标注样本仍不明确。

Method: 系统评估使用幂律拟合预测达到特定ROC-AUC阈值所需训练样本量的方法，测试多种病理和基础模型。

Result: XrayCLIP和XraySigLIP相比ResNet-50基线能用显著更少的标注样本达到强性能，仅50个标注病例的学习曲线斜率就能准确预测最终性能平台。

Conclusion: 研究结果使从业者能够通过仅标注达到目标性能所需的基本样本来最小化标注成本。

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential
samples for targeted performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前交互式3D分割方法局限于单一领域和单一交互方式的问题，避免多数据集训练时的负迁移，开发一个通用的跨领域分割工具。

Method: 在7个跨领域数据集上训练，使用领域自适应归一化防止负迁移；对于文本提示分割，自动生成掩码建议并与CLIP文本查询嵌入匹配。

Result: 在9个零样本基准测试中，8个实现了最先进性能；在5个文本提示基准测试中均取得竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 统一模型可以匹配或超越专业领域特定方法，为可扩展的3D标注提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个使用扩散模型将合成数据集适配到目标领域的新框架，仅需不完美的伪标签就能生成高质量的目标对齐图像，显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据集与真实图像存在明显差距，特别是在特定目标领域（如Cityscapes）中，这种差距限制了模型性能。传统方法需要昂贵的3D建模，违背了低成本标注数据的初衷。

Method: 使用现成的扩散模型，仅通过不完美的伪标签进行目标领域适配训练。该方法过滤次优生成结果，修正图像-标签不对齐问题，并标准化跨数据集的语义，将弱合成数据转化为有竞争力的真实领域训练集。

Result: 在五个合成数据集和两个真实目标数据集上的实验显示，分割性能比最先进的翻译方法提升高达+8.0% mIoU，使快速构建的合成数据集与需要大量手动设计的高成本合成数据集一样有效。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了一种有价值的协作范式，快速语义原型设计与生成模型相结合，能够为城市场景理解创建可扩展的高质量训练数据。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for
hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three
foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery:
HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth
dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned
on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent
test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average
accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%),
DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of
93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved
91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong
generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results
provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational
hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.

Result: 在三个基准数据集和六个最先进的主干网络上进行的广泛实验表明，MS-Mix始终优于现有方法，为稳健的多模态情感增强建立了新标准。

Conclusion: MS-Mix通过情感敏感的混合机制有效解决了多模态情感分析中的数据增强问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

Motivation: 传统场景坐标回归方法在训练视图和查询图像成像条件差异较大时泛化能力不足，因为其训练目标本质上是将训练视图编码到回归器权重中，导致过拟合

Method: 将坐标回归器和地图表示分离为通用变换器和场景特定地图代码，在大规模场景上预训练变换器，使其能够从映射图像泛化到未见过的查询图像

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的重定位数据集上，ACE-G方法显著提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了较低的计算开销

Conclusion: 通过分离坐标回归器和地图表示，并利用大规模预训练，可以有效解决传统场景坐标回归方法的泛化限制问题

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽略了真实实验室工作的细粒度和长期性特点，特别是湿实验室环境，无法准确评估MLLMs在科学发现加速方面的真正潜力。

Method: 从同行评审视频出版物中收集数据，建立三级任务层次：细粒度感知、程序理解、科学推理；采用视觉中心标注流程，结合自动生成和多学科专家验证。

Result: 评估19个领先MLLMs发现，它们在粗粒度识别上表现良好，但在区分细节、跟踪状态变化和连接实验程序与科学结果方面存在困难；专有模型与开源模型在高级推理方面存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ExpVid不仅提供了诊断工具，还为开发能够在科学实验中成为可信赖伙伴的MLLMs绘制了路线图。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

TL;DR: NV3D是一个新颖的3D物体检测模型，通过从体素邻居提取法向量特征来增强特征表示，并采用两种采样策略减少55%数据量同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态方法面临特征对齐挑战，而局部特征提取对复杂3D检测任务可能过于简化。NV3D旨在通过法向量特征更好地理解表面与目标实体之间的关系。

Method: 使用KNN和PCA计算每个体素的法向量，采用法向量密度采样和FOV感知分箱采样策略减少数据量，并应用元素级注意力融合机制。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，NV3D在汽车和骑行者检测上表现优异，无采样时分别达到86.60%和80.18% mAP，比基线Voxel R-CNN分别提升2.61%和4.23%。使用采样后仍能保持85.54% mAP，同时过滤约55%体素。

Conclusion: 法向量特征能有效提升3D物体检测性能，特别是对具有空间形状的目标如汽车和骑行者，同时采样策略能显著减少计算量而不牺牲精度。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

Conclusion: 通过将单张图像转换为物理合理的3D人类-场景对，PhySIC推进了可扩展的3D场景理解。

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the
InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

Conclusion: FACE框架通过理论保证和实验验证，能够提供更忠实的概念解释，弥合低层特征与高层语义之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出用表示自编码器(RAE)替代传统VAE作为扩散变换器(DiT)的潜在空间编码器，解决了VAE的局限性，并在ImageNet上取得了优异的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DiT使用的VAE编码器存在三个主要问题：过时的骨干网络架构、低维潜在空间限制信息容量、以及纯重建训练导致的弱表示质量，这些都限制了生成质量。

Method: 使用预训练表示编码器(如DINO、SigLIP、MAE)配合训练的解码器构成RAE，创建高质量重建和语义丰富的潜在空间。针对高维潜在空间的挑战，提出了理论驱动的解决方案，并使用轻量级宽DDT头增强DiT。

Result: 在ImageNet上取得了显著成果：无引导时256x256分辨率FID为1.51，有引导时256x256和512x512分辨率FID均为1.13，实现了更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: RAE具有明显优势，应该成为扩散变换器训练的新标准方法。

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

Conclusion: 这种混合方法在图像分类中具有更高效和鲁棒的潜力，能更好地量化不确定性并在数据稀缺情况下保持性能。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

Result: 在文本到全景、修复和外延任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在11个定量指标上实现了更好的边界一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: DiT360通过数据中心的视角和混合训练策略，有效提升了全景图像生成的质量和几何保真度。

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is

Motivation: 跟踪器和视频生成器解决密切相关的问题：前者分析运动，后者合成运动。这种联系使得预训练的视频扩散模型能够执行零样本点跟踪。

Method: 在查询点放置彩色标记，然后从中等噪声水平重新生成视频的其余部分，传播标记跨帧。使用未编辑的初始帧作为负提示，确保标记在反事实生成中保持可见。

Result: 实验表明，这种"涌现"跟踪方法优于先前的零样本方法，能够持续通过遮挡，性能与专门的自监督模型相当。

Conclusion: 预训练的视频扩散模型可以通过简单的视觉提示执行有效的零样本点跟踪，展示了生成模型在分析任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Conclusion: Ev4DGS成功证明了仅从事件流学习非刚性物体新视角渲染的可行性，为事件相机在动态场景中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at

*Zeyu Ling,Xiaodong Gu,Jiangnan Tang,Changqing Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SyncLipMAE是一个自监督预训练框架，通过掩码视觉建模和跨模态对比对齐，从无标签音视频流中学习同步感知和可迁移的面部动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决说话人脸视频中需要学习同步感知的面部动态表示，并支持多种下游任务的需求。

Method: 结合掩码视觉建模与跨模态对比对齐，使用三个逐帧提示令牌编码身份、语音同步面部动态和音频无关运动，通过对比学习实现音视频流同步。

Result: 在四个需要不同能力的任务家族中实现了最先进的结果，包括音视频流同步、面部情感识别、视觉语音识别和视觉配音。

Conclusion: 同步感知、分解的自监督预训练在说话人脸视频分析中非常有效，能够实现统一的模型接口支持多种下游应用。

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

TL;DR: 提出几何框架将LLM推理建模为表示空间中的流，通过位置、速度、曲率等几何量分析推理过程，验证LLM是否内化了超越表面形式的逻辑结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型如何在表示空间中"思考"，探索LLM是否真正内化了逻辑结构而不仅仅是表面语义。

Method: 使用相同自然演绎命题但不同语义载体的方法，将逻辑结构与语义解耦，通过学习的表示代理设计受控实验来可视化和量化推理流。

Result: 理论证明：(1) LLM推理对应表示空间中的平滑流；(2) 逻辑语句作为这些流速度的局部控制器。实验验证了理论框架。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究推理现象提供了概念基础和实践工具，为LLM行为的可解释性和形式分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试大多假设完全自动化，未能反映真实世界中人机协作的本质，需要更严谨的人类-智能体交互评估方法。

Method: 开发PULSE评估框架，在基于OpenHands开源软件智能体的大规模网络平台上部署，收集超过1.5万用户的真实使用数据，研究LLM骨干网络、规划策略和记忆机制三个设计决策对开发者满意度的影响。

Result: 框架使智能体设计评估更加稳健，置信区间比标准A/B测试减少40%；发现真实环境结果与基准测试性能存在显著差异（如claude-sonnet-4与gpt-5对比结果呈负相关）。

Conclusion: 研究结果为人类参与的LLM智能体评估提供指导，并指出了改进智能体设计的机会，强调了基准驱动评估的局限性。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的地球观测驱动表示主要捕捉物理和光谱模式，缺乏对城市功能和社会经济维度的表征能力

Method: 轻量级多模态对齐框架，将AlphaEarth嵌入与POI文本表示对齐，丰富物理特征与语义线索

Result: 在伦敦地区，土地用途分类F1相对提升7.2%，社会经济映射KL散度相对降低23.6%

Conclusion: 通过耦合地球观测与人类中心语义，AETHER推进地理空间基础模型向整合物理形态与功能意义的通用城市表示发展

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

Abstract: Computing has long served as a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Recently,
a paradigm shift has emerged with the rise of large language models (LLMs),
introducing autonomous systems, referred to as agents, that accelerate
discovery across varying levels of autonomy. These language agents provide a
flexible and versatile framework that orchestrates interactions with human
scientists, natural language, computer language and code, and physics. This
paper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their
growing role in transforming the scientific discovery lifecycle, from
hypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and
refinement. We critically examine current methodologies, emphasizing key
innovations, practical achievements, and outstanding limitations. Additionally,
we identify open research challenges and outline promising directions for
building more robust, generalizable, and adaptive scientific agents. Our
analysis highlights the transformative potential of autonomous agents to

TL;DR: 研究发现，当AI系统使用用户记忆进行个性化时，会在情感理解中产生系统性偏见，优势用户群体获得更准确的情感解读，从而可能强化社会不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个性化AI系统越来越多地整合长期用户记忆，了解这种记忆如何影响情感推理至关重要。

Method: 通过评估15个大型语言模型在人类验证的情感智力测试上的表现，比较相同情境下不同用户档案的情感解读差异。

Result: 相同情境搭配不同用户档案会产生系统性不同的情感解读，多个高性能LLM中出现偏见，优势档案获得更准确的情感解读，且在情感理解和支持性建议任务中存在显著的人口统计学差异。

Conclusion: 为个性化设计的系统可能无意中强化社会不平等，这是记忆增强AI面临的关键挑战。

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本、基于指令的干预方法，通过分步指令和知识图谱验证来改善LLM的逻辑谬误分类能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM存在严重的推理缺陷，包括幻觉倾向和逻辑谬误分类准确性差，这源于其默认的快速直觉式系统1处理，而可靠推理需要深思熟虑的系统2方法

Method: 创建分步指令数据集，将谬误分类分解为一系列原子程序步骤（简单二元问题），并增加最终验证步骤，让模型咨询相关谬误的关系知识图谱

Result: 这种基于程序的规则干预显著提高了LLM逻辑谬误分类的性能，同时增强了决策过程的透明度

Conclusion: 该方法为神经符号架构解决LLM推理缺陷提供了一条实用途径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在敏感日常场景中的部署增加，需要理解它们在复杂道德推理中体现的价值观。现有研究多关注单轮提示，但多轮对话中的价值观形成和共识达成过程尚不明确。

Method: 使用三个模型(GPT-4.1、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、Gemini 2.0 Flash)在1000个日常道德困境中进行辩论实验，采用同步(并行响应)和轮询(顺序响应)两种格式测试顺序效应和裁决修订。

Result: 发现模型行为差异显著：GPT表现出强惯性(0.6-3.1%修订率)，而Claude和Gemini更灵活(28-41%)。价值观模式也不同：GPT强调个人自主性和直接沟通，Claude和Gemini优先考虑共情对话。辩论格式对模型行为有强烈影响。

Conclusion: 多轮互动中的道德推理受到辩论格式和模型特定行为的强烈影响，表明社会技术对齐不仅取决于系统输出，还取决于对话结构方式。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

Motivation: 现有研究主要针对简化的RAG架构进行白盒攻击，缺乏对复杂真实场景下黑盒攻击的研究。本文旨在研究攻击者不了解RAG系统内部细节的复杂现实场景。

Method: 提出RIPRAG攻击框架，将目标RAG系统视为黑盒，仅基于攻击是否成功的信息，使用强化学习优化投毒文档生成模型，确保生成的投毒文档符合目标RAG系统的偏好。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能有效对大多数复杂RAG系统执行投毒攻击，相比基线方法攻击成功率(ASR)提升高达0.72。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前防御方法的普遍缺陷，为LLM安全研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM工作流优化范式，从最大化标量分数转向最小化预期失败质量，通过失败签名空间来分析失败分布，并开发了CE-Graph框架来系统性地减少失败概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM工作流优化方法存在信息坍塌问题，将丰富的多步骤执行轨迹简化为简单的成功/失败信号，无法建模工作流的失败分布结构。

Method: 提出分布化视角，定义失败签名空间和预期失败质量概念，开发CE-Graph框架：从反例池近似失败分布，识别密集失败模式，通过提议-验证机制进行目标图编辑。

Result: 在数学、代码和问答基准测试中，CE-Graph以显著更低的成本实现了比强基线更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 系统的可靠性不是来自避免失败，而是来自系统性地学习和重塑其失败分布的几何结构。

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信念系统很少具有全局一致性，但有效的推理通常在局部持续。需要一种能够容忍矛盾、在结构支持的特定区域激活经典逻辑的推理基础。

Method: 使用有向、带符号、加权的图表示信念，节点为信念，边编码支持和矛盾。通过收缩传播过程计算置信度，定义推理区域为高置信度、结构平衡的子图，并提供近线性算法构建区域图谱。引入冲击更新来模拟信念变化。

Result: 在合成带符号图上进行了实验，报告了区域恢复、冲击下的稳定性以及运行时间。

Conclusion: 这是一个容忍矛盾的推理原则性基础，能够在结构支持的地方精确激活经典逻辑。

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival

TL;DR: StepFly是一个用于自动化故障排除指南(TSG)执行的端到端代理框架，通过三阶段工作流解决TSG质量问题、复杂控制流解析、数据密集型查询和执行并行化等挑战，在真实TSG和事件上实现了约94%的成功率，显著减少执行时间和令牌消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模IT系统中的故障管理依赖故障排除指南(TSG)，但手动执行缓慢且容易出错。现有的基于LLM的解决方案缺乏对TSG质量问题、复杂控制流解析、数据密集型查询和执行并行化等关键挑战的专业支持。

Method: StepFly采用三阶段工作流：1) 提供TSG Mentor工具帮助SRE改进TSG质量；2) 使用LLM进行离线预处理，从非结构化TSG中提取结构化执行DAG并创建专用查询准备插件(QPPs)；3) 在线执行阶段使用DAG引导的调度器-执行器框架，配合内存系统保证正确工作流并支持并行执行。

Result: 在真实TSG和事件上的评估显示，StepFly在GPT-4.1上达到约94%的成功率，优于基线方法，同时减少了时间和令牌消耗。对于可并行TSG，执行时间减少了32.9%到70.4%。

Conclusion: StepFly通过其创新的三阶段框架有效解决了TSG自动化中的关键挑战，显著提高了故障排除的效率和成功率，为大规模IT系统的自动化事件管理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

TL;DR: 提出了DixitWorld评估套件，包含动态多代理环境DixitArena和静态QA基准DixitBench，用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态溯因推理能力，发现模型在生成创造性和判别理解之间存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对视觉语言模型溯因推理能力的评估主要局限于静态、单代理任务，需要更全面的评估框架来解构这一挑战。

Method: 开发了DixitWorld评估套件，包含：1）DixitArena - 动态多代理环境，评估假设生成（讲故事者）和假设选择（听众）；2）DixitBench - 静态QA基准，隔离听众任务进行控制评估。

Result: 较小开源模型在作为讲故事者时表现更具创造性但判别性较差，较大专有模型在整体性能上更优，特别是在作为听众时。DixitBench与DixitArena中听众表现高度相关。

Conclusion: 多模态溯因推理中存在生成创造性和判别理解之间的关键权衡，这是开发更平衡、更强大视觉语言代理的核心挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保角色身份一致性在基于扩散的文本到图像生成中仍然是一个基本限制。

Method: 基于冻结的扩散骨干网络，CharCom使用提示感知控制动态组合适配器进行推理，实现高效的角色定制。

Result: 在多场景叙事实验中，CharCom显著提升了角色保真度、语义对齐和时间一致性，在拥挤场景中保持鲁棒性，并能以最小开销实现可扩展的多角色生成。

Conclusion: CharCom适用于故事插图和动画等实际应用场景。

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a
fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose
CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves
character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters,
enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base
model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes
adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene
narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity,
semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes
and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making
it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and
animation.

TL;DR: PALU是一种性能感知长度更新方法，将简洁推理建模为约束优化问题，通过拉格朗日优化和三个近似实现，在保持性能的同时显著减少输出长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有简洁推理方法依赖手工启发式规则，难以平衡简洁性与性能，且无法跨领域和模型规模适应。

Method: 将简洁推理建模为约束优化问题，使用拉格朗日优化转化为无约束问题，并通过三个近似简化更新规则：离策略性能估计、拉格朗日乘子截断、分位数驱动的长度调整。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上，输出长度减少65%，准确率提高15%，在五个基准测试中优于其他方法，并能跨领域和模型规模适应。

Conclusion: PALU是一种实用有效的简洁推理方法，通过原则性算法和实用近似实现了性能与简洁性的平衡。

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

TL;DR: 提出了SAFER框架，通过两阶段风险控制解决开放域问答中缺乏固定解空间的问题，提供统计保证


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性共形预测方法不适用于开放域问答场景，因为它们假设所有实例的可接受答案都能通过有限采样获得，而现实中开放域问答缺乏固定有限的解空间

Method: 两阶段风险控制框架：1) 弃权感知采样 - 使用Clopper-Pearson精确方法在校准集上校准采样预算；2) 共形化过滤 - 应用共形风险控制方法确定统计有效的置信度阈值，过滤不可靠候选答案

Result: SAFER框架能够控制正确答案被排除的风险，兼容各种任务特定的准入标准和校准-测试分割比例，具有鲁棒性和高数据效率

Conclusion: SAFER为开放域问答中的LLM输出可信度提供了有效的统计保证框架，解决了现有方法在无限解空间场景中的局限性

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出Environment Tuning训练范式，通过结构化课程、环境增强和细粒度奖励，让LLM智能体直接从问题实例中学习复杂行为，无需专家轨迹数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM智能体在复杂工具使用任务中面临的高质量训练数据稀缺问题，以及SFT方法容易过拟合、标准RL方法存在冷启动和训练不稳定性的挑战。

Method: Environment Tuning范式，包含结构化课程设计、提供纠正反馈的环境增强技术，以及确保稳定高效探索的细粒度进度奖励机制。

Result: 仅使用BFCL基准的400个问题实例，不仅达到与强基线相当的分布内性能，还展现出优越的分布外泛化能力，避免了SFT方法的性能崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 实现了从基于静态轨迹的监督微调到动态环境探索的范式转变，为训练更鲁棒和数据高效的智能体开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法依赖粗糙启发式，缺乏对引导位置和干预强度的原则性考量，需要更可靠的行为控制方法来确保LLM的可信生成。

Method: 从双视角（尾平均和末端token）学习属性对齐子空间，通过约束几何目标选择干预强度，进行样本级正交残差校准，并使用轻量级位置扫描识别可注入位置。

Result: 在不同模型和评估范式下，PIXEL持续改善属性对齐，同时保持模型通用能力，为LLM可控生成提供了实用且原则性的方法。

Conclusion: PIXEL提供了一种无需调优的激活引导框架，通过位置感知的干预和最小干预原则，实现了可靠的LLM行为对齐，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长推理模型在多种推理场景中表现出色，但存在因过度思考导致的计算成本增加和推理延迟问题，需要平衡推理性能与效率。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) 冷启动阶段使用监督微调构建混合推理数据集；2) 强化学习阶段引入熵引导混合策略优化(EHPO)，在高熵单元进行分支，并使用难度感知惩罚平衡快慢推理。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ADR在保持性能的同时将推理输出长度减少49.5%-59.3%，性能提升最高达6.1%。

Conclusion: ADR通过自适应双推理机制有效平衡了推理性能与效率，在减少计算开销的同时提升了推理准确性。

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更鲁棒的模型架构和提高安全关键应用中的部署安全性提供了指导

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: 该方法完全模型无关，显著提升了现成MLRM的可靠性和可解释性，使其能够安全部署在高风险应用中。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

Motivation: 解决LLM幻觉问题，提高部署可靠性，需要有效的不确定性量化方法。推理轨迹长度作为置信度估计器的潜力值得研究。

Method: 通过多模型、多数据集、多提示的综合实验，比较推理轨迹长度与其他零样本置信度估计器（如口头置信度）的性能，并分析后训练对轨迹长度-准确率关系的影响机制。

Result: 轨迹长度作为置信度估计器表现良好，与口头置信度方法相当但互补。推理后训练显著改变了轨迹长度与准确率的关系，高熵或"分叉"标记在机制中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 推理后训练增强了不确定性量化能力，轨迹长度是大型推理模型的实用置信度度量方法。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

*Sihang Zeng,Yujuan Fu,Sitong Zhou,Zixuan Yu,Lucas Jing Liu,Jun Wen,Matthew Thompson,Ruth Etzioni,Meliha Yetisgen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Traj-CoA是一个用于患者轨迹建模的多智能体系统，通过链式智能体处理电子健康记录数据，使用共享记忆模块减少噪声并保留时间线，在肺癌风险预测任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然可以通用化建模患者轨迹，但在处理电子健康记录数据时面临时间长、噪声多的问题，影响时间推理能力。

Method: 采用多智能体系统，包括工作智能体链顺序处理EHR数据块，将关键事件提炼到共享长期记忆模块EHRMem中，最后由管理智能体综合信息进行预测。

Result: 在基于五年EHR数据的零样本一年肺癌风险预测任务中，Traj-CoA在四类基线方法中表现最优，展现出临床对齐的时间推理能力。

Conclusion: Traj-CoA为建模复杂患者轨迹提供了一个有前景的鲁棒且可泛化的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling
patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic
health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient
trajectories.

TL;DR: 提出了MedCoAct框架，通过置信度感知的多智能体协作模拟临床团队合作，解决现有医疗AI系统在整合诊断和治疗工作流中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗AI系统在处理孤立医疗任务时表现出色，但在整合临床工作流中连接诊断推理和用药决策时存在困难，缺乏临床团队中的交叉验证和知识整合。

Method: 提出MedCoAct置信度感知多智能体框架，集成专业医生和药剂师智能体，并创建DrugCareQA基准来评估医疗AI在整合诊断和治疗工作流中的能力。

Result: MedCoAct实现了67.58%的诊断准确率和67.58%的用药推荐准确率，分别比单智能体框架提高了7.04%和7.08%。

Conclusion: 这种协作方法在不同医疗领域泛化良好，特别适用于远程医疗咨询和常规临床场景，同时提供可解释的决策路径。

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This
collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving
especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical
scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

*Martina G. Vilas,Safoora Yousefi,Besmira Nushi,Eric Horvitz,Vidhisha Balachandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Latent-Trajectory信号来预测推理过程成功概率，通过分析模型内部表征的时间演化，显著提高推理效率，减少70%计算量同时提升2.6%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型通过增加计算量来提升性能，但识别哪些推理路径可能成功是关键机会，可靠预测有效路径可大幅减少计算浪费并提高整体效率。

Method: 引入Latent-Trajectory信号，通过测量推理开始到结束的内部表征整体变化、中间步骤累积变化以及这些变化向最终状态推进的程度来预测解决方案准确性。

Result: Latent-Trajectory信号比跨层度量和基于输出的置信度更可靠地预测解决方案准确性。在多个采样生成中指导答案选择时，比多数投票更有效高效，减少70%token使用量同时平均提升2.6%准确率。

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅提供了推理时效率的实用策略，还提供了关于推理过程如何在潜在空间中表示和区分的更深层可解释性视角。

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

*Xinbang Dai,Huikang Hu,Yongrui Chen,Jiaqi Li,Rihui Jin,Yuyang Zhang,Xiaoguang Li,Lifeng Shang,Guilin Qi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ELAIPBench是一个由领域专家策划的基准测试，用于评估LLM对AI研究论文的理解能力，包含403个多选题，实验显示最佳LLM准确率仅39.95%，远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM对完整学术论文的深度理解能力方面存在不足，要么问题设计肤浅，要么评估指标不可靠。

Method: 通过激励驱动的对抗性标注过程开发ELAIPBench基准，包含137篇论文的403个多选题，涵盖三个难度级别，强调非平凡推理而非浅层检索。

Result: 最佳性能的LLM准确率仅为39.95%，远低于人类表现。配备思维模式或RAG系统的前沿LLM未能改善结果，甚至因过度思考或噪声检索而降低准确率。

Conclusion: 当前LLM能力与真正理解学术论文之间存在显著差距，现有增强技术（如思维模式、RAG）未能有效提升深度理解能力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

### [252] [A Layered Intuition -- Method Model with Scope Extension for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10592)
*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种直觉-方法分层模型与范围扩展的统一框架，通过直觉思考提供快速初步答案，方法思考将问题与解决方案解耦为可转移的推理单元，并引入垂直、水平、时间和空间四种范围扩展方式，构建系统化的知识网络，提高LLM解决未知问题的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究已引入基于方法的推理和范围扩展来增强LLM性能，但缺乏系统整合。本文旨在将这些思想统一成一个更系统的框架，以更好地解决间接（未见）问题。

Method: 提出直觉-方法分层模型：直觉层提供快速反应，方法层将问题与解决方案解耦为可转移推理单元。引入四种范围扩展：垂直（因果分析）、水平（平行和泛化问题）、时间和空间扩展，构建知识树网络。

Result: 建立了系统化的知识网络框架，提高了LLM的适应性。提出了方法扩展熵作为定量评估指标，衡量扩展的独立性和多样性，反映系统解决未知问题的能力。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑连接现有方法并引入新的扩展方式和基于熵的评估框架，这项工作推进了LLM在现实问题解决中更鲁棒和可扩展的推理范式。

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

*Ruolan Cheng,Yong Deng,Serafín Moral,José Ramón Trillo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文从随机有限集和可转移信念模型两个角度深入分析随机置换集之间的距离，提出基于累积Jaccard指数的距离度量方法，具有自然的上权重特性，克服了现有方法的缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机置换集是表示有序结构不确定信息的新框架，测量置换质量函数之间的距离是RPS理论的关键研究课题。

Method: 采用RPS的层-2信念结构解释，从置换出发引入累积Jaccard指数的新定义来量化两个置换之间的相似性，并基于累积Jaccard指数矩阵提出RPS的距离度量方法。

Result: 提出的方法不仅克服了现有方法的缺点，与Jousselme距离兼容，而且具有更高的敏感性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 基于累积Jaccard指数的距离度量方法为RPS理论提供了有效的距离测量工具，具有自然的上权重特性和参数可调性。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用进化算法优化大型语言模型的方法(EA4LLM)，首次成功训练了10亿参数的LLM，挑战了基于梯度优化是训练神经网络唯一可行方法的普遍假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于梯度优化方法对硬件要求严格、需要高并发高内存GPU，以及要求所有神经网络操作可微分的问题，使许多有前景的不可微分架构能够实际应用。

Method: 使用进化算法(EA4LLM)优化大型语言模型，从预训练阶段开始训练10亿参数的LLM。

Result: 成功训练了10亿参数的LLM，提供了关于进化算法如何有效优化神经网络的关键见解。

Conclusion: 该方法挑战了基于梯度优化是训练神经网络唯一可行方法的假设，有潜力显著降低训练大型语言模型的计算成本，使计算资源有限的群体能够参与深度学习研究。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

TL;DR: 提出多智能体强化学习框架，协调领域专业智能体进行多模态文本到图像生成，通过PPO训练和复合奖励函数提升语义对齐和细节质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态文本到图像生成中语义对齐和专业级细节保持的困难

Method: 多智能体强化学习框架，包含文本增强和图像生成两个耦合子系统，使用PPO训练和复合奖励函数，通过对比学习、双向注意力和迭代反馈实现跨模态对齐

Result: 在六个实验设置中，生成内容显著丰富（词数增加1614%），ROUGE-1分数降低69.7%，基于Transformer的融合策略获得最高综合得分（0.521），多模态集成产生中等一致性（0.444-0.481）

Conclusion: 协作式、专业化驱动的架构在推进可靠多模态生成系统方面具有前景

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然学生满意度已被广泛研究，但可解释机器学习和神经网络等现代技术尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用结合提升方法和可解释性的自动分段线性回归(APLR)模型，并与几种最先进方法进行比较。

Result: APLR提供最佳拟合效果，通过数值和可视化解释识别出影响满意度的关键因素。

Conclusion: 影响因素可在个体层面解释，使教育者能根据学生特征定制教学指导。

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern
techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在数据效率低、过度简化现实动态、难以实施操作约束等问题，或者依赖人工设计的高层目标而缺乏对底层路由动态的认知。

Method: 构建动态分层系统，LLM作为元优化器生成语义启发式，底层优化器负责约束执行和实时决策，通过和谐搜索驱动的闭环进化过程迭代优化LLM提示。

Result: 在纽约和芝加哥出租车数据集场景上的实验表明，该方法相比最先进基线平均提升16%的性能。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效解决了在线网约车平台的供需平衡问题，结合了LLM的语义理解能力和数学优化的约束执行能力。

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了UCAS方法，通过利用模型内部不确定性信号来改进信用分配，解决RLVR中均匀优势信号导致的探索效率低下和熵崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR算法如GRPO在序列中所有token上广播统一优势信号，忽略了推理过程中关键的不确定、高风险决策，导致探索效率低下和熵崩溃问题。

Method: UCAS是一个无模型方法，分两阶段运作：首先使用模型的整体自信度调节响应级优势，然后基于原始logit确定性应用token级惩罚。这种双重机制鼓励探索高不确定性但能得出正确答案的路径，同时惩罚过度自信的错误推理。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试上的广泛实验表明，UCAS在多个模型规模（包括1.5B和7B）上都显著优于强RLVR基线。分析确认UCAS不仅获得更高奖励，还促进更大的推理多样性并成功缓解熵崩溃。

Conclusion: UCAS通过不确定性感知的优势塑造有效平衡了探索与利用的权衡，显著提升了LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Abstract: Generative Agentic AI systems are emerging as a powerful paradigm for
automating complex, multi-step tasks. However, many existing frameworks for
building these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning
curve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and
deployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python
framework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid
development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows
through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture
decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting
ease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over
100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture,
operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility
through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to
real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks
like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool
optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow
environments.

Motivation: 现有的基准测试无法全面评估音频和视觉模态之间的协同推理能力，往往忽视其中一个模态或以逻辑不一致的方式整合它们。

Method: 构建包含1000个高质量问答对的大规模基准测试，每个问答对都有逐步推理轨迹，源自628个多样化视频，涵盖13种精心设计的问题类型。

Result: 多个MLLM在OmniVideoBench上的评估显示，模型性能与人类推理之间存在显著差距，开源模型明显落后于闭源模型。

Conclusion: 该基准测试将促进开发具有更强、更通用推理能力的MLLM，揭示了真正音视频推理的内在困难。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

*Yang Xu,Shuwei Chen,Jun Liu,Feng Cao,Xingxing He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了扩展三角方法(ETM)，这是一种形式化和扩展矛盾分离机制的通用矛盾构建算法，作为多个高性能定理证明器的核心算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理演算基于二元归结，限制了多子句之间的推理协同作用。矛盾分离扩展(CSE)框架将逻辑推理重新定义为矛盾分离过程，但其算法实现尚未形式化。

Method: ETM在三角几何框架内统一了多种矛盾构建策略，包括标准扩展方法，支持灵活的子句交互和动态协同。

Result: 基于ETM的定理证明器(CSE、CSE-E、CSI-E、CSI-Enig)在标准一阶基准测试(TPTP问题集和CASC 2018-2015)中取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: ETM将矛盾分离范式推进为通用、可扩展且具有实际竞争力的自动推理模型，为逻辑推理和定理证明的未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

### [263] [Adaptive Selection of Symbolic Languages for Improving LLM Logical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10703)
*Xiangyu Wang,Haocheng Yang,Fengxiang Cheng,Fenrong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应选择符号语言的方法来改进LLM的逻辑推理性能，通过为每个自然语言问题选择最合适的符号语言形式化方法，显著提升了推理准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将自然语言问题转换为符号语言时，只关注语义相似性，而忽略了目标符号语言类型本身的选择对推理性能的重要影响。不同逻辑推理问题对应不同的最优符号语言形式化方法。

Method: 利用LLM为每个问题自适应选择最适合的符号语言（一阶逻辑、逻辑编程或布尔可满足性），然后将自然语言问题翻译到目标符号语言表达式，并使用相应的逻辑求解器得出最终答案。

Result: 在基准测试上的实验结果表明，自适应选择方法显著优于将所有问题翻译为单一符号语言或随机选择符号语言的方法。在混合数据集上达到96%的准确率，比一阶逻辑翻译的次高准确率提升了25%。

Conclusion: 不同自然语言逻辑推理问题对应不同的最优符号语言形式化方法，自适应选择目标符号语言可以显著提升LLM的逻辑推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

*Enric Junque de Fortuny,Veronica Roberta Cappelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个框架来评估大型语言模型是否具备真正的战略思维能力，通过分离信念、评估和选择来分析模型在非合作博弈中的表现，发现前沿模型能够展现信念一致的最佳响应行为，并形成新颖的启发式策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估LLMs在均衡策略或推理深度方面的表现，但尚未探索它们是否具备真正的战略思维能力——即能否连贯地形成对其他智能体的信念、评估可能行动并基于信念做出选择。

Method: 开发了一个框架，在静态完全信息博弈中分离信念、评估和选择三个要素，通过分析模型的显性选择和推理轨迹，并引入无上下文博弈来排除记忆模仿的影响。

Result: 前沿模型在目标推理深度上展现出信念一致的最佳响应行为；在无约束条件下会自我限制推理深度，并对人类和合成对手形成差异化推测；在复杂度增加时，显式递归让位于内部生成的稳定、模型特定的启发式选择规则。

Conclusion: 信念一致性、元推理和新颖启发式形成可以从语言建模目标中共同涌现，为研究人工智能体的战略认知提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

*Meiru Zhang,Philipp Borchert,Milan Gritta,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRIFT框架通过将非正式数学陈述分解为子组件来改进LLMs的自动形式化，显著提升了前提检索效果和在定理证明中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在数学定理证明中难以识别和利用前提数学知识及其形式化表示的挑战，传统检索方法因非正式数学陈述复杂且上下文有限而效果不佳。

Method: 引入DRIFT框架，将非正式数学陈述分解为更易处理的子组件，从Mathlib等数学库中进行针对性前提检索，并检索示例定理以帮助模型更有效地使用前提。

Result: 在多个基准测试中一致提升前提检索性能，ProofNet上F1分数比DPR基线提高近一倍，在分布外ConNF基准上表现优异，GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1的BEq+@10分别提升37.14%和42.25%。

Conclusion: 数学自动形式化中的检索效果高度依赖模型特定的知识边界，需要与各模型能力相适应的自适应检索策略。

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

*Daniel Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个框架来表征具身AI中的神经症行为：内部一致但与现实错位的行为，源于规划、不确定性处理和厌恶记忆的交互作用。在网格导航任务中识别了多种神经症模式，并开发了在线检测器和逃逸策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具身AI中出现的神经症行为，这些行为虽然内部逻辑一致但与现实环境不匹配，可能导致系统失效。需要系统性方法来识别和解决这类问题。

Method: 在网格导航系统中识别多种神经症模式，开发轻量级在线检测器和可重用的逃逸策略。使用遗传编程进行破坏性测试，演化世界和扰动来最大化法律压力和神经症评分。

Result: 识别了12种神经症模式，开发了相应的检测和逃逸机制。发现即使在完全可见的情况下，持久的恐惧回避行为仍然存在。破坏性测试生成了对抗性课程和反事实轨迹。

Conclusion: 局部修复不足够，全局失效可能仍然存在。需要架构层面的修订，而不仅仅是症状级别的补丁。破坏性测试有助于暴露需要根本性改进的地方。

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

*Renxuan Tan,Rongpeng Li,Fei Wang,Chenghui Peng,Shaoyun Wu,Zhifeng Zhao,Honggang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于博弈论和LLM的多智能体强化学习框架，用于自动生成自适应MAC协议，无需手动配置或重新训练即可适应动态网络环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAC协议需要手动配置，而基于深度强化学习的协议虽然能提升性能但泛化性和适应性差，需要昂贵的重新训练来适应动态环境。

Method: 将上行链路传输建模为动态多跟随者Stackelberg博弈，使用LLM驱动的智能体通过PPO协调合成自适应语义MAC协议，采用协议动作语法确保可靠性。

Result: 仿真显示该框架比传统基线方法吞吐量提升77.6%，公平性改善65.2%，且能很好地泛化到用户数量波动的情况而无需重新训练。

Conclusion: 该LLM赋能的博弈论MARL框架能够自动生成高性能、高适应性的MAC协议，有效解决了传统方法的泛化性和适应性限制问题。

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

TL;DR: 提出了PaperArena评估基准，用于测试LLM代理在跨论文推理和多工具协调方面的能力，现有最先进代理仅达到38.78%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要局限于单篇论文内的无工具任务，缺乏针对真实研究场景中跨论文推理和多工具协调的评估基准。

Method: 构建PaperArena基准，提供模块化可扩展平台，包含多模态解析、上下文检索和程序化计算等工具，评估代理整合多篇论文信息的能力。

Result: 最先进的LLM代理系统平均准确率仅为38.78%，在困难子集上降至18.47%，所有测试代理都表现出工具使用效率低下的问题。

Conclusion: PaperArena揭示了当前LLM代理在科学发现任务中的显著局限性，为开发更强大代理提供了重要基准和方向。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Proof-of-Use(PoU)框架，解决RAG代理中的工具调用黑客问题，通过证据基础的强化学习确保检索证据与最终答案之间的可验证因果联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现RAG代理存在工具调用黑客问题，即代理通过发出表面正确的工具调用来夸大奖励信号，而不真正利用检索证据，导致模式崩溃和虚假接地。

Method: 提出PoU框架，通过统一的逐步合约结合语法引用验证、基于扰动的敏感性奖励和答案-证据对齐目标，确保工具使用的可解释性和功能接地。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，PoU在事实准确性、证据忠实度和工具路由平衡方面持续优于DeepResearch基线。

Conclusion: 强调需要将RL训练代理不仅基于任务结果，还要基于检索信息的因果使用，为可信的检索增强推理提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化混合检索框架，集成知识库语言增强模型、深度图表示和嵌入驱动语义搜索，用于企业异构系统的复杂查询处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业知识分散在Jira、Git、Confluence等异构系统中，传统基于关键词或静态嵌入的检索方法难以处理需要上下文推理和多跳推理的复杂查询。

Method: 构建统一知识图谱，集成语义相似性搜索、结构推理和多跳推理，通过查询分析动态确定最优检索策略，支持结构化和非结构化数据源的独立或融合处理。

Result: 在大规模Git仓库上的实验表明，统一推理层相比独立GPT检索管道将答案相关性提高了80%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过图构建、混合推理和交互式可视化的结合，为企业环境中的智能知识助手提供了可扩展、可解释和以用户为中心的基础。

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在语义理解方面表现出色，但在精确时空理解方面存在不足，特别是忽略了视频中的物理信息（如多物体布局和运动），这限制了在具身智能和VR等需要高精度应用中的使用。

Conclusion: Video-STR通过图强化学习方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型在精确时空推理方面的局限性，为下游高精度应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.
Code, model, and data will be released.

Conclusion: 模型插值方法为构建具有精确目标推理能力的模型提供了实用框架，简化了模型合并过程。

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 在制造系统中，识别故障原因对维持和提高生产效率至关重要。基于知识的故障原因推断需要知识库能明确结构化目标系统和故障知识，并包含足够长的故障因果链。

Method: 构建诊断知识本体论，提出基于功能-行为-结构模型的维护记录积累方法，利用该方法积累的维护记录进行故障原因推断。

Conclusion: 该方法利用设计阶段对目标的理解和知识来支持维护阶段的知识积累和问题解决，有望成为未来整个工程链知识共享的基础。未来需要开发针对这些维护记录的推断方法、构建用户界面，并在更大更多样化的系统上进行验证。

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

Conclusion: 计算论证最适合满足法律领域透明度的技术和规范要求，但需要解决偏见缓解、司法环境中的实证验证等开放挑战。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
socio-economic systems are entering a new stage of "human-AI co-creation."
Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic
model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output
evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI
collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show
that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based
models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the
expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological
catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or
even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based
analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system
transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as
quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as
large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power
infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data
centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the
sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,
financial, and societal fields.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARIA是一个基于规范驱动、人机协同的自动化可解释数据分析框架，通过自然语言规范定义分析目标，自动生成可执行代码并验证计算，实现透明、协作和可复现的科学发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学数据的快速增长导致分析能力与研究意图之间存在差距，现有AI分析工具要么偏向自动化而缺乏透明度，要么依赖手动脚本阻碍可扩展性和可复现性。

Method: ARIA集成六个互操作层（命令、上下文、代码、数据、编排和AI模块），采用文档中心化工作流统一人类推理和机器执行，通过自然语言规范自主生成可执行代码。

Result: 在波士顿房价案例中，ARIA发现25个关键特征并确定XGBoost为最佳模型（R平方=0.93），过拟合最小。跨领域评估显示ARIA在性能、可解释性和效率方面优于最先进系统。

Conclusion: ARIA通过将AI研究原则与科学原则结合在规范驱动架构中，为透明、协作和可复现的科学发现建立了新范式。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了$How^{2}$框架，使AI代理能够提问、存储和复用how-to问题答案，在交互环境中实现终身学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理在规划问题中需要回答how-to问题来减少不确定性，但这类问题的开放性使得AI难以有效提问和回答以支持高效规划

Method: 引入$How^{2}$记忆代理框架，在Minecraft制作环境中评估，使用不同抽象层次的教师模型回答问题

Result: 终身学习代理从抽象且与当前状态解耦的答案中获益最大

Conclusion: $How^{2}$为基于LLM的代理提供了一种通过交互环境中提问来持续提升规划能力的方法

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CDRA方法，将LLM对齐从标量奖励匹配重构为结构化推理过程，通过DeepPref基准和Pers-GenPRM模型解决用户深度偏好推断和防御性推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法推断用户的深度隐含偏好（包括未陈述的目标、语义上下文和风险容忍度），且缺乏应对现实世界模糊性的防御性推理能力，导致响应肤浅、脆弱和短视。

Method: 1. 引入DeepPref基准数据集（3000个偏好-查询对）；2. 提出个性化生成过程奖励模型（Pers-GenPRM），将奖励建模重构为个性化推理任务；3. 通过批判驱动策略对齐进行过程级在线强化学习。

Result: 实验表明CDRA在发现和适应用户真实偏好方面表现出色，同时执行稳健的推理。

Conclusion: CDRA通过结构化推理过程有效解决了LLM个性化对齐中的深度偏好推断和防御性推理问题，提供了可解释的奖励信号。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 防御深度策略依赖于不同对齐技术的故障模式不相关，但若所有技术具有相同故障模式，则防御深度无法提供额外保护

Method: 分析7种代表性对齐技术和7种故障模式的重叠情况

Result: 揭示了不同对齐技术故障模式的相关性程度

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于理解当前风险水平和未来AI对齐研究的优先级排序

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

TL;DR: PADME是一个基于图表示的智能代理框架，能够将自然语言程序文本转化为可执行图结构，实现长期任务的自主执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能代理在执行自然语言程序（如食谱、科学协议）时的漂移和失败问题，这些程序具有多变性和缺乏结构性的特点。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：Teach阶段将程序文本结构化并丰富可执行逻辑，Execute阶段根据实时输入和环境反馈进行动态执行。

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld等四个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 基于图的程序表示为智能代理提供了强大的中间抽象，支持鲁棒和可泛化的执行。

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

Motivation: 解决教学流程建模碎片化问题，克服智能体在模拟多样化教育参与者时的性能限制，推动从"经验时代"向"模拟时代"的转变。

Method: 构建Zero-Exp策略，采用连续"经验-反思-优化"循环，基于包含经验和知识库的双记忆库结构，融入短期和长期记忆组件，使智能体在多样化模拟学校场景中通过情境交互自主进化。

Result: 实验证实AAS能有效模拟复杂教育动态，促进智能体高级认知能力发展，生成高保真行为交互数据。

Conclusion: AAS为从经验时代向模拟时代过渡提供了基础性垫脚石，通过生成高质量模拟数据支持教育系统研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

Conclusion: 该框架、基准和指标为开发忠实于本体论的技能分解系统提供了可复现的基础。

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

TL;DR: 提出了维度级奖励模型(DRM)，通过置信度、相关性和连贯性三个维度评估推理过程质量，解决了传统结果监督强化学习和过程级奖励模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的结果监督强化学习(RLVR)只奖励正确答案但容易传播错误推理，过程级奖励模型(PRM)缺乏泛化性和可解释性，需要任务特定的推理过程分割。

Method: 提出维度级奖励模型(DRM)，从三个基本维度评估推理过程：置信度用于不确定性校准，相关性用于语义对齐，连贯性用于逻辑一致性。这些维度无需真实答案即可进行可解释的评估。

Result: 实验结果显示DRM提供有效的监督信号，指导LLM优化并增强推理能力。在数学、问答、代码执行和谜题等任务上，DRM监督训练在分布内和分布外任务上都取得一致增益。

Conclusion: 多维度的推理过程监督可以提升LLM在训练分布之外的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将演绎推理和溯因推理分开处理，但两者具有明显的协同潜力：演绎可以验证假设，溯因可以发现更深层的逻辑模式。为了弥合这一差距，需要统一的推理框架。

Method: 提出DARK框架，采用掩码扩散模型捕获查询与结论的双向关系。关键创新包括：自反去噪过程迭代生成和验证候选假设；逻辑探索强化学习方法同时掩码查询和结论，探索新的推理组合。

Result: 在多个基准知识图谱上的广泛实验表明，DARK在演绎和溯因推理任务上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 统一方法在知识图谱推理中具有显著优势，DARK框架成功实现了演绎和溯因推理的协同效应。

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly
for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI
enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private
data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants
across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing
zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI
and Anthropic and Meta. In this work, we explore zero data retention policies
for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution
is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such
systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of
commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this
arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct
technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce
AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing
much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data
retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models
service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.

TL;DR: 提出了CC-Gen基准和CAP-CPT方法，用于解决LLM代理系统中政策文档内部化问题，通过可控复杂度评估和政策分类预训练，显著减少提示长度并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理系统中的政策文档快速增长导致计算开销高，需要将政策文档嵌入模型先验中，但现有提示压缩方法难以处理多复杂度级别的代理政策文档。

Method: 开发CC-Gen基准生成器（可控四个复杂度级别），提出CAP-CPT方法：自动解析政策文档，分类为事实性、行为性和条件性规范，通过目标数据合成和自回归预训练损失实现政策内部化。

Result: CAP-CPT在所有设置下均优于SFT基线，在Qwen-3-32B上提升达41%和22%，在CC-Gen上实现97.3%的提示长度减少，并在tau-Bench上以最少SFT数据获得进一步改进。

Conclusion: CAP-CPT通过政策分类和针对性预训练，有效减轻数据和推理负担，显著提升LLM代理对复杂政策规范的处理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

*Sanjula De Alwis,Indrajith Ekanayake*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个结合可解释AI、生存分析和RFM分析的三组件框架，用于客户流失分析，旨在从单纯预测转向制定个性化留存策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线零售中客户获取成本高于留存成本，但现有流失模型多为黑箱，缺乏对流失原因、干预时机和高风险客户群体的洞察。

Method: 集成可解释AI量化特征贡献、生存分析建模流失风险时间、RFM分析按交易行为细分客户的三组件框架。

Result: 该框架能够识别流失驱动因素、估计干预窗口、确定优先行动客户群体。

Conclusion: 该综合方法支持减少客户流失和增强客户忠诚度的策略制定，将重点从预测转向基于可解释证据的个性化留存策略设计。

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体基准主要关注任务完成度，但忽视了并行和异步操作的时间效率问题。需要专门评估LLM在时间效率协作规划方面的能力。

Method: 基于Overcooked游戏设计ParaCook环境，提供简化的动作空间来隔离战略并行规划的核心挑战，支持可调整复杂度的评估框架。

Result: 当前最先进的LLM在ParaCook上表现不佳，生成的计划在并行动作和协调方面存在困难，但在抽象任务上显示出并行优化的潜力。

Conclusion: ParaCook为开发时间效率感知的多智能体规划提供了可扩展的评估基础，揭示了LLM在并行规划方面的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,
establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware
multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

Abstract: Mental health applications have emerged as a critical area in computational
health, driven by rising global rates of mental illness, the integration of AI
in psychological care, and the need for scalable solutions in underserved
communities. These include therapy chatbots, crisis detection, and wellness
platforms handling sensitive data, requiring specialized AI safety beyond
general safeguards due to emotional vulnerability, risks like misdiagnosis or
symptom exacerbation, and precise management of vulnerable states to avoid
severe outcomes such as self-harm or loss of trust. Despite AI safety advances,
general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges,
including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic
guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in
resource-constrained settings, and adaptation to nuanced dialogues where
generics may introduce biases or miss distress signals. We introduce an
approach to apply Constitutional AI training with domain-specific mental health
principles for safe, domain-adapted CAI systems in computational mental health

TL;DR: 从360度视频构建大型城市环境的虚拟世界（360RVW），支持用户通过化身自由导航的交互式探索系统


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用360度视频记录整个环境的优势，创建高度真实和沉浸式的虚拟世界，让用户能够自由探索大型城市环境

Method: 通过四个主要操作构建系统：基于交叉口检测的视频分割、去除摄影师的视频补全、用于虚拟碰撞检测的语义分割、以及沿相机轨迹移动的扭曲球面投影

Result: 开发了一个允许用户在交叉口改变行走方向或通过点击地图选择新位置的交互界面，用户无需3D模型即可体验与建筑物的碰撞，并通过浏览器直接访问

Conclusion: 系统评估证实了其质量，特别是在用户存在感和交互探索方面，使其非常适合城市环境的虚拟游览

Abstract: We propose to build realistic virtual worlds, called 360RVW, for large urban
environments directly from 360{\deg} videos. We provide an interface for
interactive exploration, where users can freely navigate via their own avatars.
360{\deg} videos record the entire environment of the shooting location
simultaneously leading to highly realistic and immersive representations. Our
system uses 360{\deg} videos recorded along streets and builds a 360RVW through
four main operations: video segmentation by intersection detection, video
completion to remove the videographer, semantic segmentation for virtual
collision detection with the avatar, and projection onto a distorted sphere
that moves along the camera trajectory following the avatar's movements. Our
interface allows users to explore large urban environments by changing their
walking direction at intersections or choosing a new location by clicking on a
map. Even without a 3D model, the users can experience collision with buildings
using metadata produced by semantic segmentation. Furthermore, we stream the
360{\deg} videos so users can directly access 360RVW via their web browser. We
fully evaluate our system, including a perceptual experiment comparing our
approach to previous exploratory interfaces. The results confirm the quality of
our system, especially regarding the presence of users and the interactive
exploration, making it most suitable for a virtual tour of urban environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习在推荐系统中面临负迁移和跷跷板现象的挑战，任务间存在复杂且矛盾的相关性，需要更好的方法来利用个性化信息并减少任务冲突。

Method: DRGrad框架包含三个关键组件：路由器、更新器和个性化门网络，能够在训练过程中判断任务间的利害关系，利用所有有效梯度来减少冲突。

Result: 在包含150亿样本的真实推荐数据集上，DRGrad在AUC指标上优于现有最先进的多任务学习模型，有效管理任务冲突而不增加模型复杂度，同时改善了噪声处理能力。

Conclusion: DRGrad框架能够有效处理多任务学习中的任务冲突问题，在真实推荐系统和公开数据集上都表现出良好的性能，特别是在处理不同相关性和个性化程度的任务方面具有优势。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in
industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as
capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors
like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw
phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often
contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the
problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a
personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of
three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad
judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all
valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset
with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance
over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area
Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts
in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while
also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on
the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the
capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with
varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

Motivation: 快速城市化加剧了交通拥堵和环境压力，传统静态信号系统无法适应现代交通的动态特性，迫切需要智能自适应交通管理解决方案。

Method: 集成CCTV监控视频与多源数据描述符，采用时空特征融合、频繁序列模式挖掘(FEM)和混合LSTM-Transformer模型进行交通状态预测。

Result: 在CityFlowV2数据集上取得98.46%的预测准确率，宏精度0.9800，宏召回0.9839，宏F1分数0.9819；FEM分析发现置信度超55%的交通模式转换。

Conclusion: 视频流分析与多源数据融合对设计实时、响应式、自适应多级智能交通系统至关重要，可使城市交通更智能安全。

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain,
and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for
intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems
relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic
nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework
that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to
enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology
incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for
sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for
robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2
dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It
achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of
0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis
revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions
with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts
are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion
management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream
analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time,
responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which
makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is
crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material
engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are
computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or
real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic
materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations.
For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding
pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz
equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on
Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image
generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU
parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically
reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the
need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving.
Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time,
balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based
methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid
exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当发布新的基础模型时，即使相同任务已在先前版本中解决，实践者通常需要重新进行完整微调。任务向量虽然能捕获模型如何适应特定任务，但由于参数空间不对齐，往往无法在不同预训练模型间成功传输。

Method: GradFix方法：基于新模型的梯度符号结构，通过计算目标模型的少量梯度并相应掩码源任务向量，实现知识传输。该方法不需要额外微调，仅需少量标注样本。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中表现出显著性能提升，始终优于朴素任务向量加法和少样本微调方法。

Conclusion: GradFix通过利用梯度符号结构实现了任务向量在不同预训练模型间的有效传输，具有理论保证和实证优势。

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

Motivation: NOvA实验需要将探测器原始命中点匹配到源粒子并识别粒子类型，传统方法使用聚类和CNN，但探测器数据是稀疏的2D图像（XZ和YZ视图），而非3D表示，需要更高效的处理方法。

Method: 提出点集神经网络，直接在稀疏矩阵上操作，通过混合两个视图信息的操作来处理数据。

Conclusion: 点集神经网络能有效处理NOvA实验的稀疏2D探测器数据，在减少内存使用的同时提高了粒子识别性能。

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino
particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can
be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source
particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has
commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector,
the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the
detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural
network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes
information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory
required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher
score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

Motivation: 扩散概率模型(DPMs)虽然取得了强大的生成性能，但其归纳偏置仍然很大程度上是隐式的。本文旨在将归纳偏置构建到扩散模型的训练和采样过程中，以更好地适应数据的目标分布。

Method: 引入各向异性噪声算子，用结构化的频率对角协方差替换各向同性前向协方差，统一带通掩码和幂律加权，允许强调或抑制指定的频带，同时保持前向过程的高斯性。推导了各向异性协方差的得分关系。

Result: 实验表明，诱导的各向异性在多个视觉数据集上优于标准扩散模型，并实现了选择性省略：在忽略特定频带中已知的损坏的同时进行学习。

Conclusion: 精心设计的各向异性前向噪声为在DPMs中定制归纳偏置提供了一个简单而有原则的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种基于Bode图表示的新损失函数log-B和log-BW，用于电化学阻抗谱数据的等效电路模型拟合。通过大规模数据集评估，发现X2损失函数在拟合质量方面表现最佳，而log-B在计算效率和参数误差方面具有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统电化学阻抗谱数据使用等效电路模型进行拟合时，通常采用非线性最小二乘法最小化损失函数。本文旨在开发新的损失函数以提高拟合性能和计算效率。

Method: 基于EIS的Bode图表示推导出两种新损失函数log-B和log-BW，使用生成的大规模EIS数据集，评估新损失函数与现有损失函数在R2分数、卡方值、计算效率和参数误差等方面的性能。

Result: 统计比较显示，损失函数的选择影响收敛性、计算效率、拟合质量和参数误差。X2损失函数在多个拟合质量指标上表现最佳，而log-B损失函数计算速度快约1.4倍，对大多数电路元件产生更低的平均绝对百分比误差。

Conclusion: 当拟合质量是主要目标时，X2损失函数是首选；对于大规模最小二乘拟合应用（如机器学习模型训练），log-B损失函数是一个强大的替代方案，在保持可接受拟合质量的同时提供更好的计算效率。

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using
an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a
loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two
new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of
EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed
loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores,
chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values.
Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts
convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis
showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional
weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit
metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary
goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while
being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit
components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for
large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training

*Changchang Sun,Vickie Chen,Yan Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SODA方法，通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏解决跨模态哈希中多标签语义提取与原始多模态数据交互不足的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度跨模态哈希方法在自监督学习语义信息方面取得进展，但多标签语义提取过程未能与原始多模态数据显式交互，导致学习到的表示级语义信息与异构多模态数据不兼容，阻碍了模态间隙的弥合

Method: 将多标签信息作为新的文本模态，重新表述为一组真实标签提示，描述图像中呈现的语义；设计跨模态教师网络，在图像和标签模态之间有效蒸馏跨模态语义特征，为图像模态学习良好映射的汉明空间；将该汉明空间作为先验知识指导跨模态学生网络学习

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该模型相对于最先进方法的优越性

Conclusion: SODA方法通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏方案，有效解决了跨模态哈希中的语义兼容性问题，显著提升了性能

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: LMCache是一个高效的KV缓存解决方案，通过跨引擎和查询共享KV缓存，解决了LLM推理系统中的资源效率问题，实现了高达15倍的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLM推理系统将引擎和查询独立处理，导致资源效率低下。虽然已有提案通过重用KV缓存和跨引擎分解查询来提高效率，但缺乏高效的KV缓存卸载和通信机制。

Method: LMCache提取并存储现代LLM引擎生成的KV缓存，在引擎和查询间共享。它支持缓存卸载（跨查询前缀重用）和预填充-解码分解（跨引擎缓存传输），通过批量数据移动、计算与I/O流水线等优化实现高性能。

Result: 评估显示，LMCache与vLLM结合在各种工作负载下实现了高达15倍的吞吐量提升，并在企业推理系统中得到广泛采用。

Conclusion: LMCache通过高效的KV缓存共享机制，显著提升了LLM推理系统的资源利用率和性能，为未来的KV缓存解决方案提供了宝贵经验。

Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries
independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource
inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by
reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by
disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be
realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM
inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV
caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM
engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.
LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming
LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV
cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both
cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode
disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and
wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache
data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement
operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,
decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class
control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for
flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.
Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x
improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community,
LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems,
which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions. The source
code of LMCache is at: https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable
forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows
promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches
lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We
present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread
forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that
predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near
fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions
form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly
applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation
health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more
robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to
increasing fire risk under climate change.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物相互作用是导致可预防不良事件的主要原因，同时了解哪些药物不相互作用对于安全处方和改善患者预后同样重要。

Method: 结合Mol2Vec和SMILES-BERT两种分子嵌入，以及基于规则的临床评分(RBScore)，使用三阶段元启发式策略(RSmpl-ACO-PSO)优化轻量级神经网络分类器。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建可靠、可解释且计算高效的药物相互作用预测模型提供了实用路径，可支持更安全的药物治疗和临床决策。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse
events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the
same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such
knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this
study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern
machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach
combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures
fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual
chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score
(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction
labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel
three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global
exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive
accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a
clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance,
studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute
to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical
pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient
models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

Motivation: 现有方法无法生成具有明确坐标而非粗略地理区域的合成人口数据，且经纬度坐标具有大空区和密度不均的特性，需要专门处理。

Method: 使用归一化流将空间坐标映射到更规则的潜在空间，然后与其它特征在变分自编码器中结合生成合成人口，同时学习空间和非空间特征的联合分布。

Result: 在121个不同地理区域的数据集上验证，NF+VAE架构优于基于copula的方法和地理区域内均匀分配等流行基准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成细粒度空间分辨率的合成人口数据，为洪水响应、疫情传播、疏散规划和交通建模等需要详细地理信息的应用打开了大门。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit
coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods
exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from
other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven
densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that
first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using
Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach
also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features,
exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating
synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121
datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an
evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility,
while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE
architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and
uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated
synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications
requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic
spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

Motivation: 含能材料在弱到中等冲击载荷下的热点形成过程对安全存储和处理至关重要，但相比强冲击条件研究较少，且直接数值模拟计算成本高昂。

Method: 改进PARCv2（物理感知循环卷积神经网络）架构，使其能够快速预测剪切局部化和塑性加热，这些过程在弱到中等冲击条件下起重要作用。

Result: PARCv2在捕捉剪切带形成的时空动态方面优于傅里叶神经算子和神经常微分方程两种物理信息模型，尽管所有模型都存在一定的失效模式。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在开发用于反应性材料的稳健AI加速仿真工具时，领域特定考虑的重要性。

Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires
capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in
microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts.
These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate
chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the
formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock
loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling
of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock
conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct
numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional
Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting
strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to
rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important
roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two
widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural
ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in
capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models
exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of
domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation
tools for reactive materials.

Result: C-DPS在多个逆问题基准测试中，定性和定量均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: C-DPS框架通过耦合扩散过程提供了一种准确稳定的逆问题解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy
or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging,
remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently
emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods
either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency
through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y}
\mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under
complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion
posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or
likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the
measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the
data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a
closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive
sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results
demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

Result: 在在线珠宝拍卖的小型数据集案例研究中，包含LLM生成的预测能提高估计效率

Conclusion: 生成式模型的历史知识和推理能力有助于克服因果推断中的维度诅咒问题

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve
causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates
of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a
high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of
conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative
models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of
these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for
embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge
and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help
overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We
consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and
demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve
efficiency in estimation.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer
vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing
these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential
equations perspective to propose a unified theoretical framework and systematic
design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an
extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical
support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting
performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning
hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is
initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the
network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy
with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training
follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical
learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope
of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a
warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit
pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted
by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact
neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between
critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network
training.

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护了原始数据隐私，但固定隐私预算的差分隐私方法在模型收敛时会引入过多噪声，影响模型性能。因此需要研究自适应隐私预算来平衡隐私保护和模型准确性。

Method: 在SelecEval模拟器中实现拉普拉斯和高斯机制的差分隐私方法，引入自适应隐私预算。特别在高斯机制中采用自适应裁剪方法，动态更新梯度而非使用固定敏感度。

Result: 通过在不同隐私预算、IID和非IID数据集以及不同客户端选择数量下进行实验，结果表明自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪能够在保护隐私的同时维持模型准确性。

Conclusion: 自适应隐私预算和自适应裁剪是有效的解决方案，能够在联邦学习中平衡隐私保护和模型性能，尽管实验仅限于200轮训练，但结果显示了其潜力。

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients
without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still
remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by
adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget.
However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the
model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem,
adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This
work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an
adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an
adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients
of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We
conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID
datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our
experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that
adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy
while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and
engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based
solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified
comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks
(WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\"odinger
equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the
study to a laser-driven case of Schr\"odinger's equation via the
Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation.
  Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors
($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs),
forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs
are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers
the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more
sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used
effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,
network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most
gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case,
indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the
following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive
residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain
decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible,
scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

TL;DR: Kelp是一个新颖的流式风险检测插件框架，通过建模LM隐藏状态的时序演化实现实时风险检测，在准确性和延迟方面优于现有方法。

Motivation: 现有防护措施多为事后检测，可能在捕获前暴露不安全内容，且延迟限制迫使其使用轻量级模型，限制了检测准确性。

Method: 提出Kelp框架，利用Streaming Latent Dynamics Head(SLD)建模风险在生成序列中的时序演化，引入Anchored Temporal Consistency(ATC)损失强制单调危害预测，并创建StreamGuardBench基准进行严格评估。

Result: 在多样化模型和数据集上，Kelp始终优于最先进的事后防护措施和先前的插件探针（平均F1提高15.61%），仅使用20M参数且每token延迟增加小于0.5毫秒。

Conclusion: Kelp通过流式风险检测有效解决了现有防护措施的局限性，在保持低延迟的同时显著提高了检测准确性。

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended
nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased
content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose
unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push
them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we
propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection
within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states
through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal
evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time
risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications,
we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic
harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides,
for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present
StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from
each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text
and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in
probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding
less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

Motivation: 深度神经网络规模不断扩大，需要剪枝、量化、低秩分解等压缩技术来减少内存、计算和能耗，但这些方法直接应用时往往会导致严重的精度下降。

Method: VCON方法在微调期间并行执行原始模型和压缩模型，逐步减少原始模型的贡献，同时逐步增加压缩模型的贡献，实现平滑过渡。

Conclusion: VCON提供了一个可泛化的方法，可以应用于现有的压缩技术，在多个基准测试中显示出一致的性能提升。

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for
compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank
decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory,
computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy
degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON),
a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed
form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed
version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution
of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of
the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the
network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy
degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language
processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies.
Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains
exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus
provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression
techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用算子学习作为电力系统时域仿真的替代模型，首次研究了仿真时间步长不变性的概念，使模型能在粗时间步长训练后泛化到精细分辨率动态。


<details>

Result: 证明了时间步长不变性的可行性，使模型在粗时间步长训练后能进行超分辨率推理，并在不同动态机制间实现泛化。

Conclusion: 算子学习方法为解决可再生能源集成中的关键挑战提供了有前景的解决方案，有助于气候变化缓解。

Abstract: Time domain simulation, i.e., modeling the system's evolution over time, is a
crucial tool for studying and enhancing power system stability and dynamic
performance. However, these simulations become computationally intractable for
renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to
capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range
of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both
fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of
renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper
explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn
mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations.
The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of
simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time
steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning
methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating
practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first
proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models
are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on
a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution,
and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work
addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the
mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model
physical systems.

*Sudip Khadka,L. S. Paudel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的特征选择框架，将偏差缓解和特征选择整合到单一学习过程中，通过动态平衡预测性能和公平性来防止偏见重现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态特征排除策略常因隐藏依赖关系而无法有效防止模型偏见，需要一种能够动态平衡准确性、泛化性和公平性的特征选择方法。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，构建多组件奖励函数，定义特征子集的动作空间，并与集成学习相结合，让智能体自适应地选择特征。

Result: 该方法能够动态平衡预测性能和公平性考虑，在预测因子相关且偏见可能无意重现的环境中提供灵活通用的特征选择方案。

Conclusion: 强化学习框架为特征选择提供了动态平衡准确性、泛化性和公平性的有效方法，优于传统的启发式过滤或包装方法。

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden
dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and
automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike
traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent
adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates
predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation
allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the
training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or
post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of
a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space
over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble
learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features
in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently
re-emerge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对假新闻检测模型的群体自适应对抗训练策略，通过将对抗性评论分为三类并动态调整训练重点，显著提升了模型对各种对抗性评论攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的假新闻检测模型在标准设置下表现良好，但在面对真实用户或大型语言模型生成的对抗性评论时容易受到攻击，导致判断失误。

Method: 方法包括三个步骤：1）将对抗性评论分为感知、认知和社会三类；2）使用LLM生成多样化的类别特定攻击；3）应用基于Dirichlet的自适应采样机制动态调整不同评论类别的训练重点。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持强检测准确性的同时，显著提高了对各种对抗性评论扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的群体自适应对抗训练策略有效增强了假新闻检测模型对对抗性评论攻击的防御能力，为构建更可靠的假新闻检测系统提供了解决方案。

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练数据识别方法缺乏统计保证，或依赖易违反的假设。需要一种能严格控制FDR且具有统计保证的方法来解决版权诉讼、隐私审计和公平评估等问题。

Method: 使用未见数据计算每个数据点的p值，构建测试集数据使用比例的保守估计器来缩放p值，然后通过数据依赖阈值选择训练数据集。

Result: 在多种大语言模型和视觉语言模型上的广泛实验表明，PTDI能严格控制FDR，并实现更高的检测能力。

Conclusion: PTDI提供了一种严格控制FDR的训练数据识别方法，具有统计保证和显著提升的检测能力，适用于大规模模型的数据识别任务。

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright
litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional
approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical
guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this
paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous
method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate
(FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point
using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator
for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these
p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by
identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent
threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with
provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets
demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦聚类问题，让互联设备能够在不共享本地数据集的情况下，基于k-means原理进行联合硬聚类。

Method: 将联邦k-means聚类表述为GTVMin问题，每个设备通过求解修改后的局部k-means问题来更新本地聚类中心，修改包括添加惩罚项来衡量相邻设备聚类中心的差异。

Result: 开发出隐私友好的联邦k-means算法，仅需在互联设备间共享聚合信息。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了在保护隐私的前提下进行分布式聚类分析。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices
have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall
dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering
based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an
instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means
algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a
modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term
to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring
devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only
requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型具有互补优势，但现有路由方法依赖准确的模型表示，添加新模型通常需要重新训练，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 查询嵌入和投影到向量空间，训练投影器和基于LLM的路由器重建原始查询；2) 在查询集上分析候选模型性能，路由器基于查询和模型性能的上下文向量预测模型是否能正确回答新查询。

Result: 在分布内和分布外任务中均实现了最先进的路由性能，支持新模型的无缝集成而无需重新训练路由器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过上下文向量有效表示模型能力，显著提升了模型路由的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model
routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the
most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance
relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically
requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model
capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded
and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to
reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the
router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query
set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model
performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without
retraining the router. The code is available at

Method: 使用自然语言定义模型，通过解释性提示迭代改进分类标准，在3个合成和3个自然数据集上进行实验，与7个基线可解释机器学习模型比较。

Result: 在6个数据集中的5个上，Narrative Learning因语言模型改进而比基线可解释模型更准确，并分析了输出词汇统计作为解释可理解性的代理指标。

Conclusion: Narrative Learning方法在多数数据集上表现优于基线可解释模型，展示了自然语言定义模型的潜力，语言模型改进是关键因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models

classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional
numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and
potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare
them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate
that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大型行为抽象（如直接跟随图或Petri网）生成解释计算成本高，需要探索在输入减少情况下解释质量的保持情况。

Method: 建立流水线：(i)从固定日志的逐步缩小前缀中发现模型，(ii)使用LLM生成解释，(iii)使用第二个LLM评估完整性、瓶颈识别和改进建议。

Result: 在合成日志上，适度减少输入时解释质量基本保持，显示出实用的成本-质量权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限环境中更高效的计算、LLM辅助的过程分析提供了一条路径，但需注意评分基于LLM且数据为合成的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual
explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing
explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs
or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an
exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive
behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively
smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple
input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a
second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested
improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under
moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is
exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than
ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward
more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in
resource-constrained settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARROW提出了一种自适应滚动多尺度时间路由方法，通过多时间间隔预测和强化学习自适应调度策略，解决了现有天气预测方法在时空依赖建模和长期预测误差累积方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的天气预测方法存在两个关键问题：1）无法充分建模全球天气系统的空间和多尺度时间依赖性；2）基于朴素自回归的滚动策略难以平衡误差累积与精细大气变化的捕捉。

Method: 构建多间隔预测模型，使用共享-私有专家混合机制捕获不同时间尺度的共享模式和特定特征，采用环形位置编码准确表示地球纬度结构，并基于强化学习开发自适应滚动调度器来选择最适合的预测时间间隔。

Conclusion: ARROW通过多尺度时间建模和自适应滚动策略，有效解决了天气预测中的时空依赖建模和长期预测精度问题，为全球天气预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis,
with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven
forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short
time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout
for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers
from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and
multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)
the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture
of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an
Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather
Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a
multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time
intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures
both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics
across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes
the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial
information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout
scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time
interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental
results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global
weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业间关系识别对金融分析和公司治理至关重要，但现有方法面临数据规模大、稀疏性和上下文依赖等挑战。图方法缺乏语义深度，而LLM难以表示关系依赖。

Method: 提出跨模态框架InterCorpRel-LLM，整合GNN和LLM，使用FactSet供应链专有数据集，设计三个训练任务：公司图匹配、行业分类和供应链关系预测。

Result: 在供应链关系识别任务中，仅使用7B参数骨干网络和轻量训练，F-score达到0.8543，显著优于GPT-5的0.2287。模型还能零样本泛化到竞争者识别任务。

Conclusion: 该框架为分析师和策略师提供了强大的工具，能够映射和推理复杂的企业网络，增强动态市场中的决策和风险管理能力。

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is
critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains
challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate
data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while
large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability
to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose
InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs,
supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records
and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry
classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective
joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that
InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5,
on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs.
0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model
also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its
ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides
analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about
complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in
dynamic markets.

Motivation: 验证词汇假说，探索机器学习能否替代传统心理学理论来构建人格模型。

Method: 从经典形容词列表使用机器学习构建自下而上的人格模型，与Big Five模型在100万条Reddit评论中进行比较分析。

Result: Big Five模型（特别是宜人性、尽责性和神经质）对在线社区提供了更强大和可解释的描述，而机器学习聚类的区分度差，未能恢复外向性特质，缺乏Big Five的心理测量一致性。

Conclusion: Big Five模型具有稳健性，人格的语义结构是情境依赖的，机器学习可以检验现有心理学理论的生态效度，但不能替代它们。

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在标签噪声和数据分布偏移时可靠性下降，因为不确定性、多样性等启发式方法会放大错误标签或冗余样本的影响。

Method: 提出两种互补信号：类均值对齐扰动评分（量化候选样本对类间几何结构的稳定或扭曲程度）和特征波动评分（捕捉训练检查点间表示的时间不稳定性）。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和CIFAR100上的实验表明，NCAL-R在合成标签噪声下具有更高的准确率和鲁棒性，对分布外数据有更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将几何可靠性标准纳入获取决策可以使主动学习对标注错误和分布偏移更具鲁棒性，是实现真实世界标注管道可信部署的关键一步。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

Motivation: 现有多模态自监督学习方法依赖CLIP式对比目标，容易过拟合到易于对齐的特征，错误地将有效跨模态关系视为负样本，导致碎片化和不可泛化的嵌入

Conclusion: ProtoMM能够捕捉跨模态互补信息，为生理信号提供连贯的"共同语言"，同时提高学习特征的可解释性

Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level
dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA,
and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected
physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances
have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches
often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned
features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives,
resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared
prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding
space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than
explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information
across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological
signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model

Conclusion: HeSRN通过槽感知解耦和保留机制，有效解决了异构图上Transformer模型的计算效率和语义建模问题，为大规模异构图表示学习提供了高效且表达力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph
representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through
self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability
to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability
and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues,
we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for
efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN
introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles
node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots
and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based
fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced
feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we
replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which
models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while
maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is
further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global
heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural
networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks,
achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

TL;DR: 研究表明在几何任务中，等变性架构比非等变性模型具有更好的扩展性，且高阶表示对应更好的扩展指数。计算最优训练时，数据和模型大小应同步扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索等变性在更大尺度下对学习原子间势能的影响，验证对称性作为基本归纳偏置在扩展时的重要性。

Method: 通过经验研究分析不同架构在数据、参数和计算量方面的幂律扩展行为，比较等变与非等变架构的扩展性能。

Result: 等变架构比非等变模型扩展性更好，高阶表示对应更优的扩展指数。计算最优训练需要数据和模型大小同步扩展。

Conclusion: 不应让模型自行发现对称性等基本归纳偏置，特别是在扩展时，因为它们改变了任务的固有难度和扩展规律。

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic
potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we
show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and
compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe
that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than
non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order
representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also
suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should
scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results
suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to
discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale,
because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding
unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals.
These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the
pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular
downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which
requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be
successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in
defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic
surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices,
to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as
Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are
applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven
approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to
automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods
generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques.
The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only
applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we
consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we
propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several
popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as
a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets
are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and
application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and
countering drones.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析揭示了Transformer在时间序列预测中的局限性，证明了线性自注意力模型无法超越经典线性模型，并分析了其渐近行为和思维链推理下的预测崩溃现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在时间序列预测任务中投入了大量努力，但经验证据表明即使是强大的Transformer模型也常常无法超越简单的线性模型。目前对这一现象的理论理解仍然有限，需要从上下文学习理论的角度进行深入分析。

Method: 采用理论分析方法，在AR(p)数据假设下，通过上下文学习理论框架分析线性自注意力模型的预测能力，包括期望MSE比较、渐近行为分析和思维链推理下的预测动态。

Result: 理论分析表明：(1) 线性自注意力模型无法在期望MSE上超越经典线性模型；(2) 当上下文长度趋于无穷时，线性自注意力渐近恢复最优线性预测器；(3) 在思维链推理下，预测会以指数速度崩溃到均值。这些发现通过精心设计的实验得到了验证。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了Transformer在时间序列预测中的基本理论局限性，为设计更有效的预测架构提供了实用洞见，鼓励研究社区重新审视时间序列预测的基本理论限制，并对直接应用复杂架构进行批判性评估。

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved
problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer
architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful
Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,
on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)
theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear
Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than
classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length
approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear
predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions
collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings
through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on
several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights
for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work
encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental
theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct
application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper
scrutiny.

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge
of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and
transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their
energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models
as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and
sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing
model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained
users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build
cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core
tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing
SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters
for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as
powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM
forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF --
and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted
linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning
lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets,
SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large
models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training
and inference in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: 该工作为更安全的智能体系统提供了实用模板，通过填补数据、模型和评估三个关键空白，实现了在计划阶段的可靠风险检测。

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing
imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority
samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require
converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to
information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been
introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches
typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness
and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap,
we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity.
First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample
generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new
permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the
LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further
enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated
synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our
method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

Conclusion: D-SPIB提供了一个灵活架构，能够平衡表示学习和生成目标，学习连贯有用的热力学内部表示。

Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional
spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important
events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially
important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a
time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important
representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The
resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information
Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and
generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is
capable of combining temperature information from different molecular
simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation
of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase
its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean
forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant
challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to
physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we
take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean
prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this
modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified
to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for
ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the
training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave
propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves
long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical
dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.
It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art
numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

Method: 使用激活修补技术测试空间和CLS token的因果作用，通过跨干净-损坏图像对移植激活；同时训练线性探针评估不同深度的计数信息可解码性。

Result: 发现系统性不匹配：中间层对象token具有强因果影响但弱可解码性，最终层对象token支持准确解码但功能上无影响；CLS token在中间层可解码但仅在最终层获得因果能力。

Conclusion: 可解码性和因果性反映了表征的互补维度——信息存在与信息使用，它们的差异可以揭示隐藏的计算电路。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

Motivation: 传统基于梯度和反向传播的训练方法面临梯度消失/爆炸、非光滑激活函数处理困难以及顺序结构限制并行化等问题，需要替代性训练方法。

Method: 通过提升训练方法将嵌套优化问题转化为高维约束优化问题，使用Bregman距离等凸优化工具，采用块坐标下降策略，包括确定性实现和隐式随机梯度方法。

Conclusion: 提升训练框架为深度神经网络训练提供了有前景的替代方案，特别适用于处理非光滑激活函数和改善训练景观条件。

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of
gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the
gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as
vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and
an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training
methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem
into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the
constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.
This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted
training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel
Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse
architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and
Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from
convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates
distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,
and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the
implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,
including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive
optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.
Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,
detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,
unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.
Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and
stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,
particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization
for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*,
introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes
near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation
laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become
globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal
lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that
can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow
architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity
theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose
a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and
whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives
for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of
Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient
descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework,
we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new
variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to
combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as
Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to
hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for
new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for
using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: CALM是一种专门为表格数据设计的因果分析语言模型，通过Mamba架构和综合证据集成，在复杂系统中实现了超过91%的准确率，显著优于现有因果发现方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有因果发现方法存在无法确定因果方向、仅限于线性关联、对忠实性假设敏感以及在庞大假设空间中搜索效率低等局限性，而大语言模型虽然具有强大推理能力，但主要针对文本数据，与大多数因果数据的表格形式不匹配。

Method: CALM采用基于Mamba的架构，从成对变量关系中分类因果模式。它整合了局部因果分数、条件独立性检验和关系属性等综合证据，能够捕捉广泛的线性、非线性和条件因果机制。模型在合成数据（线性、混合和非线性模型）和10个经过严格验证因果关系的真实生物数据集上进行训练。

Result: 实证评估显示，CALM在模拟研究中实现了超过91%的准确率，在识别丙型肝炎病毒进展因果因素的真实世界应用中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过成功将语言模型的模式识别能力适应到表格数据的复杂性中，代表了向准确且可泛化的因果发现迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields
like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However,
existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and
score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These
include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear
associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and
inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models
(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by
a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data
is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal
analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex
systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns
from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of
evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and
relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and
conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data
(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological
datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures
robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM
significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,
achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal
factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant
step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully
adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the
intricacies of tabular data.

Motivation: 现有参数化路由器需要重新训练和维护开销，非参数化路由器虽然免训练但难以泛化到异常查询，且训练集多样性有限、更新成本高。

Method: 应用指数倾斜聚合机制来平衡非参数路由器中的偏差和方差，提高对异常查询的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明ProxRouter在保持正常查询性能的同时，显著提升了异常查询的路由效果，且开销极小。

Conclusion: ProxRouter通过平衡偏差和方差的聚合机制，有效解决了非参数路由器在异常查询上的泛化问题，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms
as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate,
yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks
for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads.
Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and
cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set
queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers
struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited
diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep
current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an
exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in
nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show
ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with
minimal overhead.

Motivation: 现有基准测试未能充分评估AI代理在网页子任务（如日期选择器操作、容器滚动等短时交互）上的能力，而这些子任务对于复杂网页导航至关重要。

Method: 使用Web ARChive文件创建沙盒环境，包含438个动态真实网页任务。采用监督微调(SFT)和带可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)两种训练方法。

Result: 领先的计算机使用模型在WARC-Bench上最高成功率仅64.8%。SFT模型获得48.8%成功率，RLVR在SFT基础上将成功率提升到52.8%，超过许多前沿模型。

Conclusion: 掌握网页子任务对于稳健的网页规划和导航至关重要，这是现有基准测试未充分评估的能力。

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to
master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI
components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a
container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive
Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to
evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed
interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We
show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the
highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on
subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments
show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training
with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the
score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis
concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning
and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有主动学习获取函数众多，但缺乏统一的理论指导，且在大批量采样时面临计算挑战或性能下降问题。

Method: 基于贝叶斯决策理论推导主动学习算法，包括EER、EPIG等，并提出ParBaLS方法用于EPIG算法的大批量采样。

Result: 实验表明ParBaLS EPIG在多个数据集上优于其他方法，在固定预算和贝叶斯逻辑回归神经网络嵌入上表现优异。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯决策理论为主动学习提供了统一框架，ParBaLS EPIG方法有效解决了大批量采样的挑战。

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions
have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to
use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide
decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in
the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.
This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction
(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that
appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based
on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic
approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to
large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or
dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular
formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling
(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets
that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian
Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at

TL;DR: TAWRMAC是一个新颖的动态图表示学习框架，通过整合时序匿名游走、内存增强和邻居共现嵌入，解决了现有方法在嵌入稳定性、上下文感知和结构动态捕捉方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续时间动态图学习方法面临三个关键挑战：(1)仅依赖节点特定内存而未能有效整合邻居信息，导致嵌入过时；(2)未能显式捕捉节点邻居间的相关性，限制上下文感知；(3)在缺乏丰富链接属性时无法充分捕捉演化图的结构动态。

Method: 提出TAWRMAC框架，整合时序匿名游走重启机制、内存增强和邻居共现嵌入。通过内存增强的GNN和固定时间编码提高嵌入稳定性，显式捕捉邻居相关性以改善上下文表示，使用时序匿名游走重启机制区分重复交互节点和形成新连接的节点。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，TAWRMAC在动态链接预测和节点分类任务中，在转导和归纳设置下，以及三种不同负采样策略下，均持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TAWRMAC通过提供稳定、可泛化和上下文感知的嵌入，推进了连续时间动态图学习的技术水平。

Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing
evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation
systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face
three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory
without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting
in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations
between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to
fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence
of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a
novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory
Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding
stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves
contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.
Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes
between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new
connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures
structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction
and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across
three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,
generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the
art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at

### [352] [Understanding Robust Machine Learning for Nonparametric Regression with Heavy-Tailed Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09888)
*Yunlong Feng,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了在重尾噪声下的鲁棒非参数回归，使用Huber回归作为示例，提出了基于预测误差而非泛化误差的学习性度量方法，并在无界假设空间下建立了有限样本误差界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒损失的泛化误差界不能准确反映样本外性能，且在弱矩假设和无界函数空间下，标准浓度工具失效，需要新的分析框架。

Method: 引入概率有效假设空间来约束估计量，建立比较定理连接鲁棒风险与L2预测误差，在RKHS中分析Tikhonov正则化风险最小化。

Result: 建立了新的比较定理，将超额鲁棒风险与L2预测误差联系起来，推导出Huber回归在RKHS中的显式有限样本误差界和收敛速率。

Conclusion: 预测误差而非超额泛化风险应作为分析鲁棒学习的基本视角，研究提供了原则性的调参规则，并适用于其他鲁棒损失函数。

Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of
heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions
and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber
regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:
(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment
assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded
hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional
generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture
out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be
quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth
$f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of
robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a
\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator
with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition
under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new
comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction
error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying
the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$.
Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence
rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and
under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends
beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not
excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust
learning.

TL;DR: 提出基于条件变分自编码器的概率误差校正框架，用于北极海冰浓度的季节性预测，能够生成大量调整后的预测集合，比传统方法表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的北极海冰浓度季节性预测系统存在系统性偏差和复杂时空误差，传统确定性后处理方法无法充分量化不确定性，而决策需要适当的概率信息。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器模型，将观测数据的条件分布映射到有偏差的模型预测上，从而生成大量调整后的预测集合。

Result: 调整后的预测在校准性、与观测分布的接近程度和误差大小方面都优于传统气候平均调整预测。

Conclusion: 提出的概率误差校正框架能够有效改善北极海冰浓度季节性预测的质量，为决策提供更可靠的不确定性信息。

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the
negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline
of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often
show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the
forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected
and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice
concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing
methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more
recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best
to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.
However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and
likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic
error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model
to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model
prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of
adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic
metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to
the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological
mean adjusted forecasts.

TL;DR: 提出了Chain-of-Influence (CoI)框架，通过多级注意力机制显式建模临床特征间的时间传播依赖关系，在预测准确性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉临床时间序列数据中潜在的、时变的特征间依赖关系，无法显式建模一个临床变量如何随时间影响其他变量。

Method: CoI使用多级注意力架构：时间注意力层识别关键时间点，跨特征注意力层建模这些时间点上特征对后续特征的定向影响，构建显式的时间展开影响图。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集和慢性肾病队列上的评估显示，CoI在预测准确性上显著优于现有方法，并能揭示具有临床意义的患者特异性疾病进展模式。

Conclusion: CoI提供了前所未有的透明度，能够追踪影响路径，展示任何时间点的任何特征如何直接或间接影响最终预测，为临床决策提供洞察。

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing
latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches
often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly
model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over
time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep
learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature
interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a
temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;
second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from
features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the
tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how
any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and
through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and
disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic
kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods
in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that
CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease
progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented
transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform
clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: T2J是一个通过提示增强框架来改进LLM从PyTorch到JAX代码翻译的方法，通过构建修复后的数据集和结构化指导，显著提升了翻译质量和运行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PyTorch和JAX虽然都嵌入在Python中，但在核心设计、执行语义和生态系统成熟度上存在差异。JAX较新且在公开代码中代表性不足，平行PyTorch-JAX语料库有限，现有评估方法在跨框架基准测试中存在弱点。

Method: T2J框架包含三个步骤：(1) 从TorchLeet和CodeParrot收集PyTorch代码，使用GPT-4o-mini生成初始JAX草稿；(2) 专业开发者迭代修复草稿直至功能等价，构建包含常见错误和修复的固定bug数据集；(3) 构建增强提示，注入结构化指导来引导轻量级LLM。

Result: T2J将GPT-4o-mini在CodeBLEU上的性能提升高达10%，T2J修复成本分数提升50%，T2J代码翻译分数提升1.33分（0-4分制），T2J比较分数提升100%。生成的代码运行速度比基线快2.5倍。

Conclusion: T2J框架通过系统化的数据集构建和提示增强，有效解决了PyTorch到JAX代码翻译的挑战，显著提升了翻译质量和效率，为跨框架代码迁移提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation
among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The
two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution
semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively
underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited.
Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework
benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens
LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch
sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a
GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini
to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to
iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a
curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs
augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer
lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored
to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based
estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).
Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%
on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%
on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster
than the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer广泛应用，但其训练过程不稳定。Layer Normalization作为标准组件能改善稳定性，但其放置位置往往缺乏理论依据，需要系统研究不同位置对训练动态的影响。

Method: 通过理论分析研究不同Layer Normalization位置对前向和后向稳定性的影响，推导隐藏状态增长的显式界限，分析梯度反向传播的动态，并指导残差连接步长的缩放策略。

Result: 理论分析揭示了不同Layer Normalization位置如何驱动Transformer训练走向正则解或病态行为，数值结果验证了理论发现，并证明适当的残差步长缩放能进一步提升稳定性和性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为Transformer架构设计提供了系统性分析框架，能够检验新架构修改下的稳定性，为未来设计提供指导原则。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable.
Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its
placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study
on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of
Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory
provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives
Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward
stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained
Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization
affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training
dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the
scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can
further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate
our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a
principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new
architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive
biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In
this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model),
a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based

large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward
candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This
integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific
therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In
targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved
binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art
generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules
designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease
mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced
generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical
therapeutic development.

*Nikola Surjanovic,Alexandre Bouchard-Côté,Trevor Campbell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoGD是一种自动调整学习率的梯度下降方法，无需用户手动调参，能够在不知道平滑度常数的情况下达到接近最优的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梯度下降等优化方法的性能严重依赖学习率的选择，手动调参需要大量用户努力，特别是在作为其他算法内循环时更不实用。

Method: AutoGD在每次迭代时自动判断是增加还是减少学习率，无需平滑度常数知识，并可扩展到AutoBFGS和AutoLBFGS。

Result: 在传统问题和变分推断优化任务上的实验表明该方法性能强劲，能够恢复GD的最优收敛速度（最多相差一个常数倍）。

Conclusion: AutoGD提供了一种实用的自动学习率调整方案，解决了梯度下降方法中学习率调参的难题。

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard
gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However,
it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an
appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of
other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be
impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method
that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate
at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we
can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of
functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety
of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks
demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to
AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

### [360] [Phase-Aware Deep Learning with Complex-Valued CNNs for Audio Signal Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09926)
*Naman Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究探索了复数卷积神经网络在音频信号处理中的应用，重点研究如何保留和利用实值网络通常忽略的相位信息。通过理论框架构建和三个阶段的实验验证，证明了复数架构的表达能力以及相位作为音频处理中有意义特征的价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实值神经网络在处理音频信号时往往忽略相位信息，而相位在音频处理中具有重要价值。本研究旨在开发能够有效保留和利用相位信息的复数卷积神经网络架构。

Method: 构建复数卷积神经网络的理论框架，包括复数卷积、池化层、Wirtinger微分和各种复数激活函数。采用复数批归一化和权重初始化方案确保训练稳定性。通过三个阶段进行实证评估：图像数据集基准测试、基于MFCC的音频分类、以及引入图神经网络建模相位信息。

Result: 在图像数据集上，复数CNN与实值CNN表现相当；在音频分类中，复数CNN在实值MFCC上略优于实值CNN；通过图神经网络建模相位信息在二元和多类流派分类中都带来了可衡量的性能提升。

Conclusion: 复数架构具有强大的表达能力，相位是音频处理中有意义且可利用的特征。虽然当前方法（特别是cardioid激活函数）显示出潜力，但未来需要开发更多相位感知设计来充分挖掘复数表示在神经网络中的潜力。

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued
Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus
on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued
networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of
CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based
differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are
complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex
batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in
training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.
First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they
demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic
complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first
evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and
validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second
experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform
real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in
exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third
experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where
the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class
genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of
complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable
feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise,
especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware
design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations
in neural networks.

### [361] [MemPromptTSS: Persistent Prompt Memory for Iterative Multi-Granularity Time Series State Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09930)
*Ching Chang,Ming-Chih Lo,Chiao-Tung Chan,Wen-Chih Peng,Tien-Fu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemPromptTSS是一个用于多粒度时间序列分割的框架，通过引入持久提示记忆来解决现有方法中提示影响快速衰减的问题，在单次和多次迭代推理中都显著提升了分割准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割的提示方法只在局部上下文中操作，提示的影响会快速消失，无法在整个序列中指导预测。需要一种能够使提示影响持久化的方法。

Method: 提出MemPromptTSS框架，使用记忆编码器将提示及其周围子序列转换为记忆令牌存储在银行中，使每个新预测不仅基于局部线索，还能基于所有累积的提示。

Result: 在6个数据集上的实验显示，MemPromptTSS在单次和多次迭代推理中分别比最佳基线方法提升了23%和85%的准确率，每次迭代平均增益为2.66个百分点。

Conclusion: 持久记忆对于提示引导的分割至关重要，MemPromptTSS为实际应用提供了一个实用有效的框架。

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

*Payel Bhattacharjee,Fengwei Tian,Meiyu Zhong,Guangyi Zhang,Osvaldo Simeone,Ravi Tandon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SQS-SD框架，通过结构化稀疏化和基于格子的量化来压缩边缘SLM生成的草稿令牌分布，以解决边缘-云推理中的带宽瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘-云推测解码中，边缘-云链路的有限带宽限制了草稿令牌分布的高效压缩，这是加速推理的主要瓶颈。

Method: 提出SQS-SD框架，利用分布稀疏性进行结构化稀疏化和格子量化。其中K-SQS使用固定top-K截断，C-SQS通过在线符合预测自适应调整保留令牌集。

Result: 实验结果表明，两种方法在互补的操作机制下都能改善端到端延迟和拒绝率。

Conclusion: 信息论分析指导下的SQS-SD框架有效解决了边缘-云推测解码中的带宽限制问题，通过不同的稀疏化策略在不同场景下提升性能。

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a
cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by
a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central
bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates
efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an
information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into
contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization
distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample
SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through
structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this
framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts
the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded
deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both
approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary
operating regimes.

### [363] [Clustering Result Re-guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09959)
*Jun Yin,Runcheng Cai,Shiliang Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CRG_IMSC方法，通过非负约束直接获取聚类结果，并利用谱聚类结果构建连通性矩阵来改进不完全多视图谱聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不完全多视图谱聚类方法需要在特征提取后使用K-means算法生成聚类结果，且未能有效利用样本连通性信息。

Method: 通过施加非负约束直接提取聚类结果，根据谱聚类结果构建连通性矩阵，并基于该矩阵最小化自表示残差，使用乘法更新迭代算法求解优化问题。

Result: 在基准数据集上，CRG_IMSC优于现有最先进的聚类方法，并验证了算法的收敛性。

Conclusion: CRG_IMSC通过直接获取聚类结果和有效利用样本连通性，提高了不完全多视图聚类的性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to
multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data
with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be
performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature
extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the
clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we
propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering
(CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing
nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the
connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and
minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix.
A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve
the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.
On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than
state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also
demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架和算法在保证最优策略等价性的同时，有效平衡了计算效率和聚合引起的性能损失。

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the
original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the
aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the
ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of
homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value
functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we
establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and
derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound
for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy
Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient
conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances
computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In
the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative
evaluations against seven algorithms.

*Mingyang Lyu,Yinqian Sun,Erliang Lin,Huangrui Li,Ruolin Chen,Feifei Zhao,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)算法，用于解决基于流匹配的VLA模型在线强化学习中的重要性采样难题，通过重新定义重要性采样并整合多种优化技术，实现了稳定可扩展的在线强化微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型性能受限于监督数据的质量和覆盖范围，而传统策略梯度方法在流匹配模型中由于重要性采样不可行而计算不可行。

Method: FPO算法通过利用条件流匹配目标的每样本变化重新定义重要性采样，整合结构感知信用分配、裁剪代理目标、多步潜在探索和Q集成机制。

Result: 在LIBERO基准和ALOHA模拟任务上，FPO相比监督学习、偏好对齐、扩散基、自回归在线RL和π₀-FAST基线均表现出持续改进，在稀疏奖励下实现稳定学习。

Conclusion: FPO有效解决了流匹配VLA模型的在线RL挑战，消融研究验证了各组件贡献，证明了条件流匹配目标在在线RL中的稳定收敛性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have
shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their
performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of
supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖标注数据进行监督训练，要么只能检测极端异常，无法有效识别细微的语义异常来捕捉新机制或意外例程的开始

Method: 基于矩阵轮廓的无监督异常检测算法，捕捉制造周期相似性并进行语义分割

Result: 在真实世界传感器数据上的实验证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够精确识别增材制造中缺陷异常的起始点

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The
real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series
data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular
usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly
detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either
heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to
detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle
semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected
routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle
similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset
of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

TL;DR: 提出GeminiNet方法，通过联合建模函数调用图和进程交互图来学习软件系统的联合嵌入表示，在恶意软件检测任务中优于单图模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多只使用单一类型的图表示来分析软件行为，而函数调用图和进程交互图提供了互补的静态和动态视角，联合建模这两种图表示可以更全面地分析软件系统。

Method: 提出GeminiNet统一神经网络方法，使用双图卷积分支和自适应门控机制来平衡静态和动态视图的贡献，构建了包含635个Windows可执行文件的新数据集。

Result: 实验证明联合嵌入方法优于单图模型，在恶意软件检测任务中取得了更好的性能。

Conclusion: 通过联合建模函数调用图和进程交互图，GeminiNet能够从多视角更全面地分析软件系统，为软件行为分析提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among
functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they
can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction
goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be
captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships
between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned
by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which
focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph
representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the
system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.
While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze
software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph
representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process
interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for
deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a
pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process
Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint
embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose
GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from
both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318
malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run
sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive
gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于全局Lipschitz连续性或强对偶性的WDRO方法存在上界松弛或计算成本过高的问题，需要更紧的上界和更高效的方法。

Method: 引入原始方法和精确Lipschitz证书概念来收紧WDRO上界，提出Wasserstein分布攻击直接构建最坏情况分布候选，利用ReLU网络在激活单元上的分段仿射结构。

Result: 在广泛评估中，该方法在保持与最先进基线相当的鲁棒准确率的同时，提供了比现有方法更紧的证书。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在Wasserstein分布鲁棒优化中实现了更紧的上界和更好的灵活性，为对抗鲁棒性提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework
for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz
continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require
prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz
certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a
novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a
candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise
attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and
location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine
structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in
an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust
accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates
than existing methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了BITE（双向时频金字塔网络），一种端到端的统一架构，通过多流协同、金字塔时频注意力和双向自适应卷积，解决了EEG识别模型跨范式泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG识别模型由于数据集特定约束和个体差异，在跨范式泛化方面表现不佳，需要开发能够适应不同范式的统一架构。

Method: 采用对齐的时频流保持时间同步，使用金字塔时频注意力增强多尺度特征，结合双向自适应卷积捕获前向/后向神经动态。

Result: 在四个不同范式（BCICIV-2A/2B、HGD、SD-SSVEP）上取得最先进性能，在受试者内准确率和跨受试者泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 范式对齐的频谱-时间处理对于可靠的BCI系统至关重要，BITE作为统一架构在MI和SSVEP任务中均表现出色且计算高效。

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm
generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid
Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream
synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive
convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency
streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional
modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical
neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward
neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B,
HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject
generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance
across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our
work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential
for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of
EEG." The source code is available at https://github.com/cindy-hong/BiteEEG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调在训练数据与预训练数据相似时效果饱和，需要新的训练策略来突破性能瓶颈。

Method: 教师模型创建任务所需技能列表并标记数据点技能要求，通过监控学生回答构建缺失技能档案，采用STAT-Sel（自适应重加权）或STAT-Syn（合成新示例）两种方式构建训练集。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上，STAT在MATH上提升达7.5%，在分布外基准上平均提升4.6%，且与GRPO强化学习互补。

Conclusion: 技能导向的自适应训练应广泛改进当前训练流程，STAT是突破微调饱和的有效方法。

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when
trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they
saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning
strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition
ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher
uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then
labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By
monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile
for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their
responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two
ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but
adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,
the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across
extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements
of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,
STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,
AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is
complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved
using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We
conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current
training pipelines. Our code is available at:

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled
a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental
sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs)
offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However,
ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a
significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network
conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model
that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard
visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a
mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and
power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the
problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts:
(i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for
resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language
Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV
trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in
refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion,
introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving
inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet
conditions.

model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to
achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples
in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on
large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent
interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high
computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main
innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a
pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected
networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with
similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high
efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the
transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We
demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training
samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While
PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the
model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than
its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT
as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

TL;DR: FOSSIL是一种基于遗憾最小化的样本权重框架，通过软最大不确定性度量样本难度，构建四阶段课程学习，在小型不平衡生物医学数据集中显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型不平衡生物医学数据集中深度学习模型优化不稳定和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 使用软最大不确定性作为连续难度度量，构建四阶段课程学习（简单到非常困难），将FOSSIL集成到卷积和基于transformer的架构中。

Result: 在所有设置下，FOSSIL显著改善了判别能力（AUC=0.9573）、校准性（ECE=0.053）以及在实际扰动下的鲁棒性，优于传统基线方法。

Conclusion: FOSSIL是一个可泛化、数据高效且可解释的框架，适用于医学成像中数据稀缺情况下的难度感知学习。

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains
fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We
present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization
via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting
framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample
difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of
difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate
FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox
skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves
discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under
real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without
metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position
FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for
difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP)框架，通过深度强化学习解决三维装箱问题，能够处理多种箱子尺寸并考虑实际稳定性约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法忽略实际稳定性约束，且在多样化箱子尺寸上泛化能力有限。

Method: 使用加权奖励函数结合装载率和高度差指标，采用裁剪策略梯度优化和策略漂移方法防止策略熵崩溃。

Result: 实验表明O4M-SP在多样化箱子尺寸上成功泛化，显著优于基线方法，并能有效处理稳定性约束场景。

Conclusion: O4M-SP框架在三维装箱问题中表现出强大的泛化能力和实际应用价值，特别适用于考虑稳定性约束的物流仓储场景。

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in
logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect
practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing
across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The
primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in
a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints
common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.
First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a
new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin
utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped
policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate
policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes
during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and
significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong
practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with
stability constraints.

Conclusion: Translution成功统一了自注意力和卷积的优势，在保持高性能的同时解决了参数过多的问题，为深度学习模型提供了新的构建模块。

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

TL;DR: ADEPT是一个用于持续预训练的自适应扩展和解耦调优框架，通过选择性层扩展和自适应单元解耦调优，在数学和医学基准测试中优于全参数CPT，仅需15%参数和不到50%训练时间。

Conclusion: 定向扩展和解耦优化对于高效稳健的领域自适应持续预训练是必要的，为CPT提供了新原则。

Abstract: Conventional continual pretraining (CPT) for large language model (LLM)
domain adaptation often suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain
capacity. Existing strategies adopt layer expansion, introducing additional
trainable parameters to accommodate new knowledge. However, the uniform
expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining
its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional
specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical
capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be
function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled
Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive
CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion,
duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase
representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge.
It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter
units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and
assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and
retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT
outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58%
on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50%
training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended
investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and
decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust
domain-adaptive CPT. Our code is open-sourced at

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series
classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural
networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the
training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might
incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the
training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the
shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing
shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients
group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish
point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series
classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other
class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training
classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

TL;DR: 本文从损失景观几何角度解释了循环注意力机制在复杂推理任务中优于标准注意力的原因，提出了SHIFT分阶段训练框架来加速循环注意力的训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环注意力机制在复杂推理任务中表现优于标准注意力，但其理论优势尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在从损失景观几何角度解释这一现象。

Method: 扩展了River-Valley景观模型，区分U型谷（平坦）和V型谷（陡峭），基于经验观察提出循环注意力的递归架构诱导了向River-V-Valley的景观级归纳偏置。提出了SHIFT分阶段训练框架。

Result: 理论推导表明基于这种归纳偏置，循环注意力在河流方向上具有更好的损失收敛性，并鼓励学习复杂模式。SHIFT框架在保持可比性能的同时加速了循环注意力的训练过程。

Conclusion: 循环注意力通过诱导V型谷景观偏置在复杂推理任务中具有优势，SHIFT框架有效加速了其训练过程。

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard
transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the
theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we
explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired
by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian
levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by
distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep).
Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture
of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley.
Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss
convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage
learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by
Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical
Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that
accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable
performances.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文通过着色算法理论解释了图神经网络表达能力和泛化能力之间的权衡关系，证明了Weisfeiler-Leman着色诱导的等价类数量直接约束了GNN的Rademacher复杂度，揭示了更强的表达能力会导致更高的复杂度从而削弱泛化保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然表达能力更强的GNN能够区分更多类型的图，但实践中观察到它们往往具有更高的泛化误差。本文旨在从理论上解释这种表达能力与泛化能力之间的权衡关系。

Method: 通过着色算法的视角，将WL着色诱导的等价类数量与GNN的Rademacher复杂度联系起来，证明前者直接约束后者。该框架不仅限于消息传递GNN或1-WL，可扩展到任意GNN架构和表达能力度量。

Result: 证明了表达能力增强会导致Rademacher复杂度增加，从而削弱泛化保证。同时证明了Rademacher复杂度在颜色计数扰动下是稳定的，确保了对数据集采样变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究统一了GNN表达能力和泛化能力的研究，为理解表达能力增强通常以牺牲泛化为代价提供了理论依据，揭示了表达性与泛化之间的基本权衡关系。

Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood
through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a
richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher
generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this
trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of
coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence
classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity
-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that
greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization
guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable
under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring
robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework
is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN
architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence
classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in
GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power
often comes at the cost of generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PANTHER是一个混合生成-判别框架，通过生成式预训练从无标签行为数据中学习可迁移的用户表示，统一了用户行为预训练和下游任务适应，在微信支付中实现了25.6%的下次交易预测提升和38.6%的欺诈检测召回率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够封装广泛的世界知识，但在建模用户交互历史中的行为知识方面仍然有限。用户行为构成了一个独特的模态，其中每个由时间、上下文和交易类型等多维属性定义的动作构成一个行为标记。建模这些高基数序列具有挑战性，判别模型在有限监督下往往表现不佳。

Method: PANTHER框架包含：(1)结构化标记化将多维交易属性压缩为可解释词汇表；(2)序列模式识别模块用于建模周期性交易模式；(3)统一用户画像嵌入融合静态人口统计信息和动态交易历史；(4)通过离线缓存预训练嵌入实现实时可扩展性。

Result: 在微信支付中完全部署并在线运行，PANTHER在下次交易预测HitRate@1上提升了25.6%，在欺诈检测召回率上相对基线提升了38.6%。在公共基准上的跨领域评估显示强泛化能力，相比Transformer基线实现了高达21%的HitRate@1增益。

Conclusion: PANTHER被确立为一个可扩展、高性能的工业级序列用户行为建模框架，成功将生成式预训练扩展到用户行为领域，实现了从无标签行为数据中学习可迁移表示的目标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can
distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs
encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the
behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior
forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional
attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this
gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable
representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from
text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that
unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling
large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.
PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional
transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern
Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a
Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic
transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching
of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and
operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in
next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement
in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public
benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1
gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,
high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lighter-X是一个高效的图神经网络推荐系统框架，通过压缩稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵，将参数复杂度从O(n×d)降低到O(h×d)，其中h≪n，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图的推荐系统（如LightGCN）需要为每个节点维护d维嵌入，参数复杂度为O(n×d)，在大规模图应用中面临严重的可扩展性挑战。

Method: 分析原始结构和参数中的固有冗余，提出稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵的高效压缩方案，采用解耦框架优化模型训练过程。

Result: 在大规模交互图上，仅使用LightGCN 1%的参数就能达到相当甚至更好的性能，显著减少了参数大小和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: Lighter-X框架能够有效解决图神经网络推荐系统的可扩展性问题，为实际大规模应用部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as
LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting
in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents
the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant
challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world
applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose
\textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach
substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while
preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base
models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we
analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters,
identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose
an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and
high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized
through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the
training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with
significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction
graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with
only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

Motivation: GNNs依赖人工标注标签且难以处理复杂多样的局部拓扑结构，LLMs在少样本学习上表现良好但存在可扩展性问题，需要结合两者的互补优势。

Method: 开发GNN偏好驱动的节点选择器促进LLMs到教师GNNs的预测蒸馏，以及节点偏好驱动的GNN选择器为每个节点识别最合适的教师GNN，实现从教师GNNs到学生GNN的定制化知识蒸馏。

Result: 在真实世界文本属性图上的大量实验验证了该框架在少样本节点分类中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该偏好驱动知识蒸馏框架成功结合了LLMs和GNNs的互补优势，有效解决了少样本节点分类问题。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs
(TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily
relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local
topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single
mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in
zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge.
Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD)
framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for
few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven
node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to
teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a
node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher
GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from
teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

*Bin Yang,Qiuyu Leng,Jun Zeng,Zhenhua Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CacheClip是一个解决RAG系统中TTFT瓶颈的新框架，通过辅助LLM指导的token选择、共享前缀和分组策略，在保持高质量生成的同时显著加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存重用方法在RAG场景中面临基本权衡：前缀缓存需要相同前缀但RAG中很少出现，直接预计算因缺少跨块注意力和重复注意力沉没而牺牲质量。APE和CacheBlend等方法仍不足以支持稳健的RAG应用。

Method: CacheClip集成三种技术：(1)辅助模型引导的token选择进行选择性KV缓存重计算，(2)共享前缀消除冗余注意力沉没，(3)分组策略在部分KV缓存更新期间保持局部连贯性。辅助模型经过微调以提高选择准确性。

Result: 实验显示CacheClip在NIAH和LongBench上分别保留了94.8%和85.0%的全注意力性能，在NIAH上比APE和CacheBlend分别高出25.2%和35.1%（重计算率20%）。同时将LLM推理预填充时间加速高达1.92倍。

Conclusion: CacheClip为RAG系统中的效率-质量权衡提供了实用解决方案，实现了快速TTFT和高质量生成的双重目标。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.
Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention
performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%
and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM
inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the
efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

TL;DR: PermLLM提出了一种可学习的通道置换方法，通过Sinkhorn归一化将离散置换矩阵转化为可微分的软置换矩阵，实现端到端优化，显著提升了N:M稀疏模型的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通道置换方法依赖手工设计的质量指标，往往无法准确捕捉剪枝对模型性能的真实影响，需要更智能的优化方法。

Method: 提出可学习的通道置换(LCP)，使用Sinkhorn归一化处理置换矩阵，并结合高效的块级通道置换策略减少可学习参数和计算复杂度。

Result: 在LLaMA系列、Qwen和OPT模型上的广泛实验表明，PermLLM在优化N:M稀疏模型方面取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: PermLLM通过可学习的通道置换有效缓解了剪枝引起的误差，为N:M稀疏模型提供了更优的优化方案。

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M
sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the
retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation
methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately
capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this
limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that
introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages
Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into
differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization.
Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation
strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and
computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot
pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively
mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series,
Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in
optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法展示了深度学习天气预报模型在面对精心设计的对抗攻击时的脆弱性，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather
observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of
downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In
this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where
subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream
TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF
models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that
reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains
a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,
non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks
infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class
imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that
will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining
physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another
significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a
novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate
adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model
to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of
gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function
with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a
distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to
constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the
adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

Conclusion: FIRE通过频域分解的数学抽象，为不同类型时间序列提供了可解释且鲁棒的预测解决方案，在性能和可解释性方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or
frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers
or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and
rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance,
leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore,
the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a
critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified
frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical
abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable
and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations:
(i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive
learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss
function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive
performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by
incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly
degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image
generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy
generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address
extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically
demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is
high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for
clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of
temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion
Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the
memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo
conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and
visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project

Method: 提出STEER方法，通过熵变化感知的重新加权方案，在token级别自适应稳定熵动态，缓解过度利用并促进鲁棒探索。

Result: 实验表明STEER显著缓解熵崩溃，稳定熵动态，并在多个数学推理基准上取得更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 直接控制熵动态比间接干预更有效，STEER方法为RLVR训练提供了更稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM
reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This
phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the
exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization.
Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy
collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we
conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how
existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings
point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control
entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the
advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently
limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an
entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level
Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy
dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates
over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes
entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at

Conclusion: CauchyNet作为一种有效且高效的数据驱动预测建模工具，特别适用于资源受限和数据稀缺的环境，具有强大的理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for
function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data
imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By
embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently
captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued
models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in
Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem,
CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The
architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust
learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint
and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse
domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological
data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive
accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer
parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and
efficient tool for data-driven predictive modeling, particularly in

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

Motivation: 当前主流的连续扩散模型在训练时预测连续数值，但推理时需要舍入操作转换为离散分类类别，导致训练目标与推理过程存在显著差异，降低了分子多样性和模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: GraphBFN通过统一训练与推理过程，有效解决了连续扩散模型在分子图生成中的根本局限性，提升了生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation
problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently,
prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict
continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression
task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert
these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is
intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is
not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy
between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a
consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to
overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts
are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to
the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished
molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To
address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical
coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the
parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative
Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of
selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with
the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art
results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的递归自我修改框架（如AutoML、神经架构搜索）缺乏安全保障机制，而Godel机器虽然提供了原则性保护但无法在随机高维环境中实现形式化证明。

Method: SGM用统计置信度测试替代证明要求，使用Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS)策略来分配错误预算，仅在统计上认证改进时才允许修改。

Result: 在监督学习、强化学习和黑盒优化实验中，SGM在CIFAR-100上认证了真实改进，在ImageNet-100上拒绝了虚假改进，并在RL和优化基准测试中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SGM为学习系统中的持续、风险感知的自我修改提供了基础性基础设施。

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural
architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework
ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled
safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code;
however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings.
We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety
layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with
statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a
modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level,
while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across
rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which
indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the
error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise
validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on
CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates
robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position
SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification
in learning systems.Code is available at:

Motivation: 解决土壤湿度时间尺度反演中地表辅助因子不完整的问题，提高土壤湿度的时空分辨率。

Method: 设计渐进尺度卷积网络(PSCNet)，包含多频时间融合模块(MFTF)捕捉时间动态，以及定制的挤压激励(SE)块保留空间细节。

Conclusion: PSCNet通过有效建模土壤湿度数据的复杂时空关系，为时空降尺度提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological
processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive
microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of
SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary
factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal
resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the
low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale
convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative
components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing
temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained
seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km
spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP
demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet
exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,
outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet
consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all
sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)
In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using
high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as
all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric
and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization
validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid
spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for
spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate
spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials

\textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates
chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to

followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR
employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical

through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner
outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional
cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems
has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient
solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically
trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially
limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus
hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a
continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with
instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design
an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from
smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other
hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model
by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.
Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly
trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across
various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to
state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for
generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key
designs manifest their synergistic effect in the proposed framework.

Motivation: 理解LLMs在长文本中表现出的位置偏见现象，特别是为什么重要信息在中间位置时性能会下降，以及这种现象与人类记忆机制的相似性。

Method: 使用GPT-2和Llama变体从头开始训练，在模拟长期和短期记忆需求的简单人类记忆范式上进行实验，并分析序列完成任务。

Conclusion: 信息检索需求、模型架构和训练过程中的结构注意力动态共同导致了LLMs中观察到的位置偏见。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial
information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle"
phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We
propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss
but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during
pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a
long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.

Result: 当前LLM在描述完整的临床表现时诊断能力良好，但在不确定性下进行迭代诊断推理时表现显著下降，识别出四种常见认知错误模式。

Conclusion: VivaBench为评估对话式医学AI系统提供了标准化基准，揭示了当前LLM在不确定性下推理和决策的根本局限性。

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where
physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history,
physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current
medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge
recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is
provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn
benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our
dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as
interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,
requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate
investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a
diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions
from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades
significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under
uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes
that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)
fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)
premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical
conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs
reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a
standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for
real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we
contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how
sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making
environments.

TL;DR: ECHO是一个基于语言模型的智能体框架，通过事后经验回放技术，从失败的交互中生成优化的替代轨迹，提高在陌生环境中的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型智能体在新环境中学习时样本效率低，特别是在与人类交互或重置物理系统等成本高昂的场景中。现有架构未能充分利用语言模型生成和推理完整反事实轨迹的能力。

Method: ECHO框架包含两个组件：事后规则（使用语言模型识别相关子目标并生成优化轨迹）和更新规则（维护压缩的轨迹表示）。该框架将强化学习中的事后经验回放技术适配到语言模型智能体中。

Result: 在XMiniGrid和PeopleJoinQA两个基准测试中，ECHO比普通语言智能体基线性能提升高达80%；在XMiniGrid中，还超越了Reflexion和AWM等复杂架构，通过更有效地利用过往经验实现了对新环境的更快适应。

Conclusion: ECHO框架通过事后优化生成合成正面示例，显著提高了语言模型智能体在陌生环境中的学习效率和适应性。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

TL;DR: 提出多视图图元组框架，通过将图划分为不相交子图来捕获不同尺度的交互，解决了GNN在稠密图上效率低和信息丢失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在稠密图上效率低，且通过稀疏化方法会丢失多尺度信息，需要一种能同时捕获局部和长程交互的方法。

Method: 使用图元组框架将图划分为不相交子图，采用异构消息传递架构学习多视图表示，该架构基于非交换算子理论。

Result: 在分子属性预测和宇宙学参数推断两个应用上，多视图图元组模型性能优于单图基线。

Conclusion: 多视图图元组框架比单图消息传递模型更具表达力且风险更低，在多个科学领域展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs,
such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify
the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an
arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information
from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view
graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework
partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local
interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view
representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing
architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we
formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk
compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce
Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point
clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate
better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and
versatility of our multi-view approach.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于睡眠数据的非侵入性生物标志物，使用Transformer模型分析消费级可穿戴设备或无线传感器的睡眠数据，来检测抗抑郁药物摄入情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗抑郁药物不依从性普遍存在，导致复发、住院、自杀风险和巨额可避免成本。现有方法要么具有侵入性（血清检测、神经影像），要么基于代理指标且不准确（药片计数、药房续药）。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的模型分析来自消费级可穿戴设备或非接触式无线传感器的睡眠数据，推断抗抑郁药物摄入情况。

Result: 在包含62,000个夜晚、>20,000名参与者（1,800名抗抑郁药物使用者）的六个数据集中，生物标志物实现了AUROC = 0.84，跨药物类别泛化良好，与剂量呈比例关系，且对伴随精神药物保持稳健。纵向监测捕捉了真实世界的用药启动、减量和遗漏。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了客观、可扩展的依从性监测，有潜力改善抑郁症护理和预后。

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization,
suicide risk, and billions in avoidable costs. Clinicians need tools that
detect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive
(serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts,
pharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects
antidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model
analyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to
infer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence
assessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000
participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,
generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to
concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world
initiation, tapering, and lapses. This approach offers objective, scalable
adherence surveillance with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

<details>

Motivation: 解决多组均值估计问题，与经典多臂赌博机不同，需要为所有组分配采样预算以获得均匀准确的均值估计。

Method: 使用Hanson-Wright不等式加强次高斯方差集中性结果，设计探索自由的非自适应和自适应算法，并扩展到上下文赌博机设置。

Result: 建立了比现有结果更紧的遗憾界，识别了严格次高斯分布类，提出了利用侧信息的可证明保证算法。

Conclusion: 探索自由分配是多组均值估计的原则性高效方法，在实验设计、个性化等需要多组推断的领域有应用潜力。

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to
allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly
accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose
objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the
optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order
of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free
algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions.
First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration
using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian
distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free
non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds
than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit
settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side
information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position
exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to
multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental
design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group
inference.

### [403] [Applying non-negative matrix factorization with covariates to label matrix for classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10375)
*Kenichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NMF-LAB是一种新的监督学习框架，将分类重新定义为非负矩阵三因子化的逆问题，直接分解标签矩阵Y，将协变量A作为已知解释变量，无需外部分类器即可获得类别成员概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的非负矩阵分解是无监督的，无法直接利用类别标签。现有的监督或半监督扩展通常只通过惩罚或图约束来整合标签，仍然需要外部分类器。

Method: 将分类重新定义为非负矩阵三因子化的逆问题，直接分解标签矩阵Y，协变量A作为已知解释变量，支持核相似度集成和半监督学习（未标记数据编码为均匀分布）。

Result: 在从基准数据集到大规模MNIST数据集的各种实验中，NMF-LAB实现了有竞争力的预测准确性，对噪声或不完整标签具有鲁棒性，可扩展到高维问题，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过在三因子NMF框架内统一回归和分类，NMF-LAB为现代分类任务提供了一种新颖、概率化且可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are
unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or
semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or
graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose
\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which
redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix
tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both
features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the
observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables.
This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels,
distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that
mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers
two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly
from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates,
including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize
predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as
uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on
diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset,
demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness
to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems,
while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification
within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and
scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TreeDiff是一个基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的双空间扩散框架，用于可控图生成。它通过宏步扩展、双空间去噪和双空间验证器三个关键设计，实现了高效可控的图生成，在分子生成基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在图生成中缺乏对期望属性的控制能力，导致质量不稳定且难以融入新目标。推理时间引导方法虽然无需重新训练，但仍然是局部、启发式且可控性有限。

Method: TreeDiff结合MCTS和扩散模型，采用宏步扩展策略减少树深度，双空间去噪机制耦合潜在空间去噪和图空间离散校正，以及双空间验证器预测长期奖励。

Result: 在2D和3D分子生成基准测试中，TreeDiff在无条件和有条件设置下均达到最先进性能，且推理时间扩展性良好，能随计算资源增加持续改进。

Conclusion: TreeDiff提供了一个即插即用的推理时间方法，显著提升了图生成的可控性和质量，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在分类任务中使用非线性softmax激活的transformer仍然通过上下文学习执行梯度下降，但这是在核特征空间中对函数进行优化，并且softmax transformer具有上下文自适应学习率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究主要关注线性自注意力和连续回归任务，发现transformer可以通过梯度下降进行上下文学习。鉴于transformer通常在离散复杂任务上训练，本文旨在弥合现有研究与分类设置之间的差距。

Method: 研究transformer在分类任务中使用非线性softmax激活时的上下文学习算法，分析其在核特征空间中的梯度下降行为。

Result: 发现transformer仍然学习在上下文中执行梯度下降，但softmax transformer在核特征空间中对函数进行优化，并具有上下文自适应学习率。实证验证表明softmax注意力对上下文具有更强的适应性。

Conclusion: 这项研究增强了在更现实设置下对上下文学习算法的理论理解，推动了我们的直觉，并为向更大模型的理论桥梁奠定了基础。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by
reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is
a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the
learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical
work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear
self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn
in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained
on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the
setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation.
We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though
on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning
rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a
greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically
verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical
understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings,
pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger
models.

TL;DR: HiLoMoE是一个分层LoRA MoE框架，通过参数高效的方式实现整体扩展，结合了垂直扩展和水平扩展的优势，在CTR预测任务中实现了更好的性能-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直扩展通过层堆叠提高模型表达能力，但存在顺序计算效率问题；水平扩展通过MoE实现高效扩展，但平坦的MoE层难以捕捉推荐任务中的层次结构。为了突破投资回报边界，探索两种方向的互补优势。

Method: HiLoMoE采用轻量级rank-1专家实现参数高效的水平扩展，堆叠多个具有分层路由的MoE层以实现组合多样的专家组合。与传统堆叠不同，基于前层分数而非输出进行路由，允许所有层并行执行。采用三阶段训练框架确保稳定优化和专家多样性。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，HiLoMoE实现了更好的性能-效率权衡，与非MoE基线相比，平均AUC提升0.20%，FLOPs减少18.5%。

Conclusion: HiLoMoE框架成功结合了垂直和水平扩展的优势，在CTR预测任务中实现了参数高效的整体扩展，提供了更好的性能-效率平衡。

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model
expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to
efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts
(MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in
parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical
structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment
(ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and
propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic
scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs
lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and
stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially
diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based
on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in
parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable
optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show
that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an
average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared
to the non-MoE baseline.

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验表明，MTL-FSL框架优于各种基线方法，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: MTL-FSL框架通过建模特征间时变关系，显著提升了阿尔茨海默病预测的准确性和生物学可解释性，为解决神经退行性疾病的纵向数据分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in
aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global
healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks
do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity
Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel
Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the
time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering
temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,
our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To
solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty
terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了反向监督策略的计算复杂性，指出即使计算速度大幅提升，机器学习仍然需要初始的人类监督来定义目标和提供种子标注。生成式AI可以作为标签放大器，但人类监督仍然是必要的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在计算速度大幅提升（如量子计算或大规模并行硬件）的背景下，机器学习是否能够摆脱对人工标注的依赖。

Method: 分析反向监督策略的计算复杂性，该策略在大型未标注数据集上搜索标注以最小化小型标注集的错误。

Result: 搜索空间为2^n，即使有常数倍的加速，复杂性仍然是指数级的。因此，计算速度的提升不能消除对信息性标注或先验知识的需求。

Conclusion: 极端计算速度只能减少实际运行时间，但不能减少学习的基本监督需求。初始的人类（或人类级别）输入仍然是必要的，以将系统锚定在预期任务中。

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a
large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The
search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even
under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel
hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --
computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In
practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human
contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed
set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models
with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially
substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a
human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,
generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small
human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while
humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.
Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the
fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input
remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior.
Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for
reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic
multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown
real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because
locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories
and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a
data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement
learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the
problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement
variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.
We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states
between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,
newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of
species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with
standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior
prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual
modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential
to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

Conclusion: LightSAE通过利用通道特定信息的结构模式，有效解决了多变量时间序列预测中的表示瓶颈问题，实现了参数效率和预测精度的双重提升。

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by
memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques
that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced
multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a
single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,
quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency
improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and
activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present
AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded
Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing
weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables
bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,
bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism
incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary
codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are
enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ
structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible
overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly
narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains
competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x
over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By
aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a
practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse
service-level objectives.

### [412] [Anchor-based Maximum Discrepancy for Relative Similarity Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10477)
*Zhijian Zhou,Liuhua Peng,Xunye Tian,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于锚点的最大差异(AMD)方法，通过同时学习合适假设和核函数来解决相对相似性测试中的核选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于核的方法在相对相似性测试中面临挑战：一旦假设被手动指定，总能找到使该假设被拒绝的核函数，这导致核选择变得困难且测试定义不明确。

Method: 提出AMD方法，在深度核空间中定义相对相似性为(U,P)和(U,Q)距离的最大差异。测试分为两个阶段：第一阶段估计AMD并推断潜在假设，第二阶段评估潜在假设的统计显著性。

Result: 通过理论验证和在基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AMD方法能够同时学习假设和核函数，有效解决了相对相似性测试中的核选择问题，提供了统一的测试框架。

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions,
P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches
often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified
alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel
selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the
manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel
selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified
first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This
challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select
a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with
this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,
instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We
propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative
similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,
Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two
phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer
the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance
of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to
derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.
Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available
at: https://github.com/zhijianzhouml/AMD.

Conclusion: 该工作建立了蛋白质结合剂设计的新范式，成功将基于检索的知识与生成式AI相结合，为药物发现开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to
generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental
challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are
limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for
Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces
to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a
shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant
interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a
conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface
transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms
baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and
recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results
validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces
from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,
enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges
retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug
discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种梯度增强自训练PINN方法(gST-PINN)，通过梯度伪点自学习算法解决传统PINNs精度低、训练慢、缺乏标签数据等问题，在多个PDE问题上表现优于标准PINN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs存在精度有限、训练动态缓慢、缺乏标签数据以及多物理场交互处理不足等挑战，需要开发更有效的求解方法。

Method: 提出梯度增强自训练PINN(gST-PINN)，引入基于梯度的伪点自学习算法，可应用于缺乏标签数据的场景，泛化了PINN和gPINN方法。

Result: 在三个不同类型PDE问题上的测试表明，gST-PINN持续优于标准PINN。例如，Burgers方程达到10^-3 MSE，扩散-吸附方程达到10^-4 MSE，而gST-PINN可达到10^-5 MSE，表现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: gST-PINN在精度和收敛性方面均优于传统PINN方法，特别适用于标签数据稀缺且易出现低精度和收敛问题的场景。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for
simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and
engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven
approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed,
offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs
across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle
with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of
labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics
interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a
Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically
introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving
PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems
from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$
equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are
unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and
can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence
issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂自动驾驶场景中是否真正理解人类驾驶逻辑的问题，特别是LLM在决策时缺乏可解释性和与人类行为对齐的问题。

Method: 提出Align2Act框架，基于人类推理模式和交通规则构建结构化驾驶指令，使用Align2ActChain模块进行逐步推理，在nuPlan数据集上对LLaMA-2-7B进行LoRA微调。

Result: 在Test14-random上获得85.17的开环分数和70.31（非反应式）/66.96（反应式）的闭环分数，在真实世界nuPlan闭环基准测试中表现出改进的规划质量和人类相似性。

Conclusion: 结构化推理显著提升了LLM规划器的性能，Align2Act成功将LLM转化为与人类行为对齐的可解释规划器，在复杂自动驾驶场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous
driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data
to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language
models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs
truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning
framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners
aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on
human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and
traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our
Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an
interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with
LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an
open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and
66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or
open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness
on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that
structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM
planners.

Conclusion: f-influence框架提供了可靠的影响力估计，适用于数据清理和模型行为归因，解决了现有方法在训练随机性下的不稳定性问题。

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by
estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing
methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear
critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines
their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed
deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce
*f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis
testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish
desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation.
We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation
(**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we
scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B
and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions,
demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data
scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR,
restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations
impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in
patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative
solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics
while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for
high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods:
noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling,
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a
reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key
innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full
histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative
refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature
dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and
Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves
Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around
0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores
surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%,
confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on
synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable
to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach
matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution
fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.

Result: 在旋转MNIST和ADNI数据集上的广泛实验表明，预测准确率和域选择效率均有显著提升，优于传统连续域自适应方法

Conclusion: 该集成策略能同时优化迁移路径和目标任务性能，有效提升域自适应过程的效果

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain
shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate
domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without
explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively
explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to
conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach
introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the
distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of
optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method
facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific
features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features.
This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths
and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation
processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST
and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain
selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional
CDA approaches.

Motivation: 现有基准无法有效评估LLM强化学习的泛化能力，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 引入诊断套件和Oracle性能差距指标，通过压力测试分析泛化能力。

Result: 现有RL方法在分布偏移、难度变化和反事实场景下泛化能力差，但当前基准未能揭示这些缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出三个核心原则设计更可靠的基准：足够难度、平衡评估和分布鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement
learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains
reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets
achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets,
suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To
study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle
Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between
training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further
analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong
benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across
distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual
scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that
current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose
three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient
difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement
learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through
the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining
generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential
nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds.
Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms
like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through
PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide
exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach
provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive
performance.

Result: 在公共PADS数据集和私有数据集上验证，MFAM在复杂临床时间序列处理方面优于通用时间序列模型

Conclusion: MFAM为帕金森病严重程度的自动化评估提供了一个有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers
an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose
time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction,
making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with
PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic
features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further
complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale
Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances
feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical
prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance
learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most
diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on
both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary
classification and a private dataset for four-class severity assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that MFAM outperforms general-purpose time
series models in handling complex clinical time series with specificity,
providing a promising solution for automated assessment of PD severity.

Conclusion: 该框架在精确先验知识和完全非参数方法之间取得了平衡，能够有效处理异构数据分布下的联邦学习问题。

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning
are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or
task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing
interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents
to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without
enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge
of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead
rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an
algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By
modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an
unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the
task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a
way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical
analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical
experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical
success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we
provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation
learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives.
Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular
contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying
principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype
representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and
improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show
how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices
in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of
balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are
provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary

Conclusion: 组合对称性为深度模型的组合性提供了几何解释，并启发了基于对称性的预测编码方法，其中高层仅接收沿对称方向的粗粒度残差变换。

Abstract: In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and
compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework
where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We
connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate
a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher
layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations}
(prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower
layers.

Motivation: 脑机接口(BCI)在医疗康复和认知状态评估中具有广泛应用前景，但基于脑电图(EEG)的BCI面临数据稀缺和主体间显著变异的问题，限制了EEG解码模型在实际场景中的泛化能力和适用性。

Method: 提出FusionGen框架，基于解耦表示学习和特征融合，通过特征匹配融合模块整合跨试次特征，结合轻量级特征提取和重建流程，在有限数据条件下确保数据多样性和可训练性。

Result: 在多个公开EEG数据集上的广泛实验表明，FusionGen显著优于现有的数据增强技术，在分类准确率上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: FusionGen通过创新的特征融合和解耦表示学习方法，有效解决了EEG数据稀缺和主体间变异问题，为EEG解码模型的实用化提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging
from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing
direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via
electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained
by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the
generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings.
To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation
framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By
integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and
combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction
pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited
data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG
datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing
augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification
accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在有限预算下优化探索中间模型空间的方法，将其形式化为Lipschitz空间中未知值函数的预算分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建学习模型时经常需要评估大量中间模型（如特征选择、模型结构搜索、参数调优等），这些评估结果会影响后续模型探索决策，但真实性能只有在评估后才能获知。

Method: 将问题形式化为Lipschitz空间中未知值函数的一般预算分配问题。

Result: 提出了一种最优预算分配框架来解决中间模型探索的挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法为在有限预算下有效探索模型空间提供了理论框架和解决方案。

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate
models. Examples include models considered during feature selection, model
structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate
model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior
knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only
revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally
allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We
formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value
functions within a Lipschitz space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股票价格预测因金融市场波动性和非线性而具有挑战性，现有GAN模型存在模式崩溃、训练不稳定以及难以捕捉时空和特征相关性等问题。

Method: 使用基于GRU的编码器-解码器架构，引入带残差连接的时间解码器进行精确重构，结合静态和动态协变量进行条件学习，采用窗口机制捕捉时间动态。

Result: 在多个股票数据集上的广泛实验表明，EDGAN在预测准确性和训练稳定性方面表现优异，即使在波动市场中也能稳定收敛。

Conclusion: EDGAN模型在表达能力和简单性之间取得了良好平衡，在股票价格预测任务中显著优于传统GAN变体，特别是在市场条件下的收敛稳定性方面。

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and
non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning,
issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing
temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs
in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that
strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces
key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for
precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for
contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.
Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU
blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN
achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile
markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting
accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

Motivation: 锂离子电池在充放电循环中容量下降威胁其耐久性，现有方法对每个循环中电池状态信息的利用不足，需要更准确的容量预测来确保系统效率和可靠性。

Method: 使用半参数深度高斯过程回归框架SDG-L，结合LSTM特征提取器来建模时间序列电池状态数据，特别设计以更好地利用充放电过程中的辅助剖面信息。

Conclusion: SDG-L框架能够有效预测锂离子电池容量，通过充分利用电池状态信息提高了预测精度，为电池管理系统提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply.
However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is
threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of
charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to
ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery
state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we
propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L
to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By
introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to
better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging
process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method
obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves
better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using
ablation studies.

TL;DR: 提出ImpMIA方法，利用神经网络隐式偏差进行成员推理攻击，无需依赖参考模型，在仅有权重和训练数据超集的现实场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒成员推理攻击依赖不现实的假设：攻击者知道训练超参数、非训练样本与训练数据同分布、评估集中训练数据比例已知。移除这些假设后性能显著下降。

Method: 基于最大间隔隐式偏差理论，使用KKT最优性条件识别训练样本，通过寻找梯度最能重构模型参数的样本来实现白盒攻击。

Result: ImpMIA在仅有权重和训练数据超集的现实设置中，相比黑盒和白盒攻击都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ImpMIA通过利用神经网络隐式偏差，有效解决了传统成员推理攻击在现实场景中的局限性，无需依赖参考模型和相关假设。

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

Motivation: 当前蛋白质结构表示方法面临SE(3)流形复杂性、离散标记化或需要多个训练目标等挑战，这些都会阻碍模型优化和泛化能力。

Method: 使用非等变扩散变换器，采用瓶颈设计进行高效压缩，通过单一流匹配目标进行端到端训练。

Result: ProteinAE实现了最先进的重建质量，其潜空间为潜扩散模型提供了强大基础，能够高效生成高质量结构，性能优于现有潜空间方法。

Conclusion: ProteinAE通过简化的优化流程和连续潜空间表示，为蛋白质生成建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for
advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling.
Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold,
rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives,
all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce
ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to
overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from
E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a
non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient
compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective,
substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that
ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming
existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful
foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit
equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is
competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly
outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative
models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs
(hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic
plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we
present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical
plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines
in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering
out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of
high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination
of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and
existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture
different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled
retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis
systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic
paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we
compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends
in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly
applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.
By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,
we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

Abstract: Control Co-Design (CCD) integrates physical and control system design to
improve the performance of dynamic and autonomous systems. Despite advances in
uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly
unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering
the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs
the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in
robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens
this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the
lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive
re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and
controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers
to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending
this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each
cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT
models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and
inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The
framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled
learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more
stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly
enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this
work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation
framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed
design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price
forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state
relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and
static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation
Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock
relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market
shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that
models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational
influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware
mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic
relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across
different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational
strength and stock price.

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly
susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing
models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal
patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the
prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive
datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and
the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures
seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including
XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized
units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for
temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE
of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved
robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate
trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models
without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations
(compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without
enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve
forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes
governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in
climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant
applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured
data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been
increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the
original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative
networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain
unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and
construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a
given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given
rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an
alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,
ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d
from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )
and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for
generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,
the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree
edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN
and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced
significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%
and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards
construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and
valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed
networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear
contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common
nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain
multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood
estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist
regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES}
and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is
the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of
a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret
bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms
in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we
introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.
Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime
versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we
empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime
variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish
ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach
for nonlinear contextual bandits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs)方法，通过渐进深度扩展训练策略，为不同复杂度的数据集自动选择最优网络深度，显著减少模型大小和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在获得出色性能的同时往往伴随着不必要的模型规模、计算需求和内存占用。对于相对低复杂度的数据集，使用过深的架构会导致计算浪费、能耗过高和内存使用过多，使得在资源受限设备上部署变得不切实际。

Method: 提出渐进深度扩展训练策略，从较浅的深度开始训练深度网络，随着早期模块收敛逐步增加网络深度，直到达到目标精度。ODNs仅使用给定数据集的最优深度，移除冗余层。

Result: 在MNIST和SVHN数据集上，ResNet-18和ResNet-34的最优深度实现了高达98.64%和96.44%的内存占用减少，同时保持了99.31%和96.08%的竞争性准确率。

Conclusion: ODNs方法能够在保持竞争性准确率的同时，显著降低模型的内存占用、计算成本和能耗，促进在边缘设备上的部署。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to
fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch
between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers
used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE
samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on
deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy
induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can
be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this
reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along
with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance
Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized
denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily
high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.
Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image
models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group
relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently
narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated
using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

Motivation: 现有图神经网络模型在宏观经济冲击期间无法有效传播消息，需要改进消息传递机制以增强模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用基于注意力的多关系动态GNN，集成宏观经济上下文，通过异质节点和边类型实现稳健消息传递，核心是行业节点作为全局中介，结合GAT和Transformer技术。

Result: 在公开数据集上优于现有股票预测模型，特别是在COVID-19期间表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OmniGNN通过创新的行业节点设计和多关系动态图结构，有效解决了宏观经济冲击下的消息传播问题，提升了股票预测性能。

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to
modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock
dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages
during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an
attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic
context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.
Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling
rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range
multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to
weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal
dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms
existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating
strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法在适应问题几何结构和利用曲率信息之间存在基本权衡，需要一种能同时兼顾两者的统一框架。

Method: 提出了预条件矩阵范数的新概念，将多种优化器统一到同一原理下，并基于此框架开发了结合Muon谱几何和Adam风格预条件的新方法。

Result: 实验表明新优化器MuAdam和MuAdam-SANIA与现有最先进方法竞争，在某些情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: 该统一框架为理解各种优化器提供了新视角，新提出的方法在性能上具有竞争力。

Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods
often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and
leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to
different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,
whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information
but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across
diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework
generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods
through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction
reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more
advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP
and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this
framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale
invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and
sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we
introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which
combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some
cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Motivation: 当前深度学习架构基于感知器模型，无法捕捉生物神经元的振荡动态特性。虽然振荡系统更接近神经行为，但仍无法模拟自然神经回路中复杂的时空相互作用。

Method: BioOSS包含两个相互作用的神经元群体：p神经元模拟皮层柱中锥体细胞的膜电位样单元，o神经元控制传播速度并调节活动的横向扩散。通过局部相互作用产生波状传播模式，包含可训练的参数用于阻尼和传播速度。

Result: 在合成和真实世界任务中评估BioOSS，相比替代架构展现出优越的性能和增强的可解释性。

Conclusion: BioOSS成功模拟了前额叶皮层中关键的波状传播动态，为神经处理提供了更生物逼真的建模方法。

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models,
which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological
neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their
closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the
intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In
this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)
designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural
processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity
patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p
neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by
pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation
velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local
interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model
incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling
flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate
BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior
performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative
architectures.

Method: 使用HydroGlobe数据集（包含仅来自陆面模型模拟的基准版本和融合多源遥感数据同化的高级版本），比较线性回归、LSTM和时序融合Transformer在TWS预测中的性能。

Result: 线性回归表现稳健，优于更复杂的LSTM和时序融合Transformer模型。

Conclusion: 在开发和评估深度学习模型时应包含传统统计模型作为基准，并需要建立能捕捉自然变异和人类干预综合影响的全球代表性基准数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications,
demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and
outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in
predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are
dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven
modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally
representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived
solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version
incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that
linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM
and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the
importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when
developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the
critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that
capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

Conclusion: 剪枝作为开发能够简化时空问题模型的有效工具，具有识别问题最重要元素的潜力。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune
graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into
spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying
explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding
of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an
optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the
training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This
integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error
while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model
searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important
elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy
obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of
information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used.
These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing
models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their
most important elements.

TL;DR: MARCD是一个结合了多智能体制度条件扩散模型和CVaR分配器的投资组合决策框架，通过制度推断、危机情景生成和风险控制分配，在回测中显著提升了夏普比率并降低了最大回撤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究制度转换环境下如何通过制度条件生成情景和凸CVaR分配器来改善投资组合决策，特别是在危机期间提高尾部风险建模能力。

Method: 使用高斯隐马尔可夫模型推断潜在制度；训练带有尾部加权目标和制度专业化混合专家去噪器的扩散模型；将生成情景输入考虑换手率的CVaR二次规划分配器。

Result: 在2005-2025年回测中，MARCD夏普比率1.23（基准1.02），最大回撤9.3%（基准14.1%），夏普提升在5%水平显著，换手率相当。

Conclusion: MARCD提供了一个从尾部忠实情景建模到受治理投资组合决策的可复现桥梁，显著改善了回撤控制。

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a
convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We
introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers
latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a
tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)
denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios
into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.
In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD
outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular
generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains
Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent
reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals
indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory
linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the
decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE
denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD
offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed
portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个中间件框架，用于为机器学习数据集找到最优的掩码配置，通过最小化预测效用偏差来最大化数据效用，同时保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据共享生态系统中，由于隐私考虑，数据提供者通常会对数据集进行匿名化处理，但不同的掩码配置会导致数据效用不同。关键挑战在于高效确定最优掩码配置以最大化数据集效用。

Method: 提出基于迭代比例拟合的联合分布估计器，利用有限数据摘要或无数据来估计特征-标签联合分布，支持多种特征-标签相关性量化方法，如g3、互信息或卡方检验。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验评估显示，AEGIS识别最优掩码配置的速度比基线方法快一个数量级，且生成的掩码数据集在下游ML任务中达到与基线方法相当的预测性能。

Conclusion: AEGIS框架能够高效识别最优掩码配置，在保护隐私的同时保持数据效用，适用于原始数据因隐私限制而无法访问的场景。

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and
intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream
tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically
anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple
masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.
Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal
masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents
AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration
for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We
introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a
metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after
masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)
or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable
for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To
achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative
proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation
quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our
experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies
optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the
resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks
that is on par with baseline approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了GLANCE框架，通过轻量级路由器选择性调用LLM来增强GNN在特定节点上的预测性能，特别是在异质节点上实现显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-GNN融合策略对所有节点统一应用，性能提升有限。研究发现GNN和LLM在不同结构模式上表现各异，需要节点感知的融合方法。

Method: GLANCE框架包含轻量级路由器，基于节点信号决定是否查询LLM。路由器通过优势目标训练，比较调用LLM与仅依赖GNN的效用。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GLANCE在异质节点上实现高达13%的性能提升，同时保持最佳整体性能平衡。

Conclusion: 自适应、节点感知的GNN-LLM架构具有重要价值，选择性调用LLM可在大型图上实现可扩展部署且不增加过高计算成本。

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied
uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We
argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide
benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we
reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show
that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each
excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage
this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and
Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's
prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive
per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are
non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective
that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the
GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance
across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up
to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our
findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,
where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs
without incurring high computational costs.

Motivation: 连续状态扩散模型已在理论和实证上得到广泛研究，但离散状态扩散模型（用于文本、序列和组合结构应用）的理论理解仍然不足，现有分析都假设分数估计误差界限而未研究样本复杂度。

Method: 提出了一个原则性的理论框架，将分数估计误差分解为统计、近似、优化和裁剪四个组成部分，为离散状态扩散模型提供了结构化分析。

Result: 获得了离散状态扩散模型的第一个样本复杂度界限 $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$，证明了这类模型的理论可处理性和实践相关性。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了文献中的基本空白，为离散状态扩散模型的高效训练提供了关键见解，建立了其理论可处理性和实际相关性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the
sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively
studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models,
essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial
structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint.
In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score
estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this
work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state
diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the
score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and
clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can
be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the
literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance
of discrete-state diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有的学习策略在单独训练时可能达到次优性能，特别是缓存替换和预取这两个策略之间存在双向依赖关系，需要联合训练以获得更好的整体性能。

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for
scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By
leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting
future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing
workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained
in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In
this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching --
for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two
policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the
two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared
representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two
approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint
encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and
demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay
down an agenda for future research in this direction.

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted
significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach
- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for
heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph
heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response
varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic
correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed
filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve
expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a
heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily
degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters
to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not
follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to
guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a
simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily
spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD
NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over
leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发布机器学习模型时披露私有信息是一个常见担忧，虽然直觉上发布学习模型比发布数据集风险更小，但需要量化评估实际风险程度。

Method: 基于信息泄露上界推导出梯度唯一性这一原则性披露度量方法，并研究了基于监控梯度唯一性的简单防御机制。

Result: 该防御方法在隐私保护方面与DP-SGD等经典方法相当，但在测试准确率等效用指标上表现更优。

Conclusion: 梯度唯一性提供了一种直观的隐私审计方式，其数学推导具有通用性，不依赖特定假设，为模型发布隐私风险评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is
often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky
than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we
present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that
is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from
publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to
perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is
general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset
type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on
monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to
classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of
(utility) testing accuracy.

Motivation: 现有基于VAE的方法存在单窗口特征限制，未能充分利用长期时间和频率信息，需要改进时间序列异常检测的性能。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将长期时间和频率表示与自适应融合相结合，为时间序列异常检测提供了鲁棒高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing
field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based
methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved
promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of
single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and
frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with
Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE.
LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It
further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and
distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates
time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that
integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion
yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

Method: 采用"路由再生成"范式：首先通过查询级路由器为每个提示分配最优教师（综合考虑学生可学习性和教师响应质量），然后各教师仅为分配的提示生成数据。

Result: 在不同模型家族和规模上的广泛实验表明，PerSyn在指令调优和数学推理设置中始终优于或与所有基线方法相当。

Conclusion: PerSyn验证了其有效性，并为未来研究提供了额外见解，推动个性化数据合成的发展。

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Conclusion: 该方法为多参与方开放系统中的对抗攻击提供了新的可行方案，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.

*Yuda Bi,Ying Zhu,Vince D Calhoun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个理论框架，将经典信息论扩展到有限和结构化系统，重新定义冗余为信息组织的基本属性而非低效性。该框架将冗余表达为一族信息散度，统一了互信息、卡方依赖性和谱冗余等经典度量，揭示了它们共享的冗余几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通信理论强调最小化冗余以提高传输效率，但现实世界中的有限结构化系统（如机器学习系统）在冗余平衡点附近能达到最大稳定性和泛化能力。作者旨在建立连接通信理论和学习世界的统一冗余理论。

Method: 通过重新定义冗余为信息组织的基本属性，构建了一个几何框架，将多种经典信息度量统一为冗余散度家族。理论分析表明冗余存在上下界，形成最优平衡点。通过掩码自编码器实验验证理论。

Result: 理论预测冗余存在上下界，形成平衡点。实验显示掩码自编码器在特定冗余水平达到最佳泛化性能，验证了冗余平衡原理。

Conclusion: 冗余是可测量和可调节的量，连接了通信的渐近世界和学习的有限世界。有限结构化系统在冗余平衡点附近实现最优稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory
to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental
property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this
framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational
divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual
information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single
geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not
isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory
further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise
to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)
and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors
minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,
such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and
generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are
used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable
redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish
redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic
world of communication and the finite world of learning.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its
neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and
social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying
higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable
resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants
of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset
derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012
Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven
domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and
executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span
demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare
access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables
separately. This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover
missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating
multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.
  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the
data challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and
interpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH
factors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged
as a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities.
Other influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep,
stress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and
the value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应熵正则化(AER)框架，通过动态调整熵正则化系数来解决RLVR训练中的策略熵崩溃问题，在数学推理基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练中常出现策略熵崩溃问题，导致策略过于确定性化，阻碍探索并限制推理性能。传统的固定系数熵正则化方法效果不稳定，需要更智能的调节机制。

Method: 提出AER框架，包含三个组件：难度感知系数分配、初始锚定目标熵和动态全局系数调整，动态平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AER方法一致优于基线方法，提高了推理准确性和探索能力。

Conclusion: 自适应熵正则化能有效解决RLVR训练中的熵崩溃问题，为提升大语言模型推理能力提供了更稳定的训练方法。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

TL;DR: MC# 框架通过静态量化和动态专家剪枝的组合，对 MoE-LLMs/VLMs 进行激进压缩，在保持性能的同时显著减少模型大小和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE 模型通过稀疏激活扩展容量，但预加载所有专家并激活多个专家会带来显著的计算和内存开销，专家模块成为模型大小和推理成本的主要贡献者。

Method: 结合 Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization (PMQ) 进行静态位宽优化，通过线性编程平衡专家重要性和量化误差；使用 Online Top-any Pruning (OTP) 通过 Gumbel-Softmax 采样动态选择专家子集。

Result: 在 DeepSeek-VL2 上实现 6.2 倍权重压缩，平均 2.57 位，五个多模态基准上仅损失 1.7% 准确率；OTP 减少 20% 以上的专家激活，性能下降小于 1%。

Conclusion: MC# 通过 PMQ 的静态位宽优化和 OTP 的动态路由相结合，实现了极端压缩且精度损失最小，展示了高效部署 MoE 模型的强大潜力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation.
However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per
input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the
expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address
this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines
static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance
of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce
storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision
Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,
balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal
trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online
Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a
subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By
combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#
achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC#
achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7%
accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces
expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation,
demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Bradley-Terry奖励模型在处理相似偏好响应时区分能力不足，容易过拟合简单样本，且在分布外样本上泛化能力差，导致对齐性能不理想。

Method: 设计了一种自适应边界机制，基于语义相似度和模型预测奖励差异，从分布角度通过最优传输动态调整奖励模型对挑战性样本的关注。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在多个基准测试中优于现有奖励模型技术，在分布内和分布外设置下均表现出更好的性能、收敛速度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应边界机制有效提升了奖励模型在相似响应间的区分能力，并通过RLHF实验验证了其在更好对齐大语言模型与人类偏好方面的实际有效性。

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the
Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful,
specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often
struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,
leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well
to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to
BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to
dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,
based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which
is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport
(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,
our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences
between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in
performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental
results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both
In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our
practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our

TL;DR: 4-bit量化在推理模型中的内存优化策略与通用模型不同，存在规模依赖的权衡：小模型应优先模型容量，大模型应优先生成长度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理模型中的内存优化策略，因为KV缓存而非模型大小可能主导内存使用，这与通用模型的优化策略不同

Method: 在AIME25和GPQA-Diamond数据集上进行1700个推理场景的系统实验，分析不同规模模型在权重分配和生成长度之间的权衡

Result: 发现规模阈值（约8位4B参数）：小模型通过分配更多内存给权重获得更好精度，大模型通过分配内存给更长生成长度获得更好精度

Conclusion: 推理模型的内存优化不能规模无关，需要针对不同规模采用不同策略：小模型优先模型容量，大模型优先测试时计算

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for
non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this
universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather
than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across
1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent
trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve
better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer
generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to
longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling
becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV
quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be
scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning
models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger
ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning
models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those
established for non-reasoning models.

Method: Blade利用基于扩散模型的数据驱动先验，通过交互粒子集合进行贝叶斯反演，可以处理只能黑盒访问的非线性前向模型。

Result: 理论上建立了非渐近收敛分析，实证上在各种反问题（包括高度非线性流体动力学）上优于现有无导数贝叶斯反演方法。

Conclusion: Blade能够为贝叶斯反演产生准确且校准良好的后验分布，特别适用于导数计算困难的应用场景。

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and
engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model
derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we
introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for
Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages
powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear
forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free).
Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to
characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors.
Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing
derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems,
including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

Motivation: 自监督学习取得了显著成功，但缺乏统一的理论框架来理解和比较不同SSL范式的效率。

Method: 引入信息几何框架，定义表示效率η为学习表示空间的有效内在维度与环境维度的比值，其中有效维度来自编码器诱导的统计流形上Fisher信息矩阵的谱特性。

Result: 在特定自然假设下，证明Barlow Twins通过将表示的互相关矩阵驱动到单位矩阵，从而诱导各向同性的FIM，达到最优表示效率η=1。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解Barlow Twins的有效性提供了严格的理论基础，并为分析SSL算法提供了新的几何视角。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while
resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level.
Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain
models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models,
and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable
examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control
mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace,
preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on
unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds
that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for
unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to
spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision
backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common
preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction
attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended
data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. Our project is

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized
applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across
domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an
instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations.
InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter
that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while
preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel
contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and
representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The
contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages
autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and
contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,
thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user
embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we
demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across
multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation
scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can
effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user
representation learning.

Motivation: 现有核心集选择算法主要关注干净准确率，无法有效保持对抗鲁棒性。需要从数据中心视角理解哪些样本对学习鲁棒特征最为关键。

Method: 将样本对抗脆弱性与其硬度关联，使用AIGN量化样本硬度。提出EasyCore算法，仅保留低AIGN的简单样本进行训练。

Result: 在标准训练和TRADES对抗训练下，EasyCore相比现有核心集方法分别实现7%和5%的对抗准确率提升。

Conclusion: AIGN是模型无关的数据集属性，EasyCore是一种高效且广泛适用的数据中心方法，可显著改善对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

Conclusion: 该不确定性量化框架成功地将图结构信息整合到时间序列预测中，在保证覆盖概率的前提下大幅提高了预测精度。

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for
innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph
time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied
separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either
ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge
this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework
tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the
graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while
providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We
formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the
volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic
counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel
uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while
achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than
existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成过程中会累积误差，特别是在应用任意引导时，这会破坏样本保真度，导致离流形现象。

Conclusion: TAG是一种通用的解决方案，能有效解决扩散模型中的离流形问题，提升生成样本的质量和保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models.
However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the
generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary
guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often
breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address
the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach
leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data
manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated
with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism,
`Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired
manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the
desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in
generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的PPG信号去噪框架DPNet，采用Mamba架构进行时序建模，结合SI-SDR损失和心率预测器来保持生理信息完整性，在BIDMC数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPG信号在可穿戴健康监测中广泛应用，但常受噪声和运动伪影影响，限制了心率估计等下游应用的可靠性。

Method: 提出DPNet作为基于Mamba的去噪主干网络，结合尺度不变信噪比损失(SI-SDR)来提升波形保真度，并引入辅助心率预测器(HRP)通过心率监督提供生理一致性。

Result: 在BIDMC数据集上的实验表明，该方法对合成噪声和真实运动伪影都具有强鲁棒性，优于传统滤波和现有神经网络模型，能有效恢复PPG信号同时保持心率准确性。

Conclusion: SI-SDR损失和心率引导监督具有互补作用，该方法在可穿戴医疗系统中具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but
its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting
downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents
a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving
physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based
denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance
denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an
auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through
HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method
achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion
artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our
method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,
highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.
These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统和强化学习虽然能增强大语言模型的能力，但将在线策略强化学习应用于多智能体系统仍面临挑战，包括算法层面标准GRPO分组假设失效，以及系统层面需要支持多智能体工作流。

Method: AT-GRPO包含：(i) 针对多智能体系统定制的智能体和回合分组强化学习算法；(ii) 支持单策略和多策略模型的训练系统。

Result: 在长时程规划任务中，准确率从14.0-47.0%提升到96.0-99.5%；编程任务平均提升3.87-7.62%；数学任务平均提升9.0-17.93%。

Conclusion: AT-GRPO在多智能体强化学习方面取得了显著进展，为多智能体系统中的在线策略强化学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to
enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves
task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental
rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,
applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique
challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down
because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must
support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and
multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL
algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-
and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks,
AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases
accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5
percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to
7.62 percent on coding tasks and 9.0 to 17.93 percent on math. Code and
environments are available at: https://github.com/pettingllms-ai/PettingLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向边缘设备的单实例测试时自适应方法TED，使用CMA-ES在潜在主子空间进行前向坐标优化，无需反向传播，计算复杂度降低63倍，在ZYNQ-7020平台上成功部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备计算资源有限且面临分布偏移，现有TTA方法依赖梯度优化或批处理，不适合资源受限的边缘场景。无梯度替代方案存在学习能力有限、灵活性差或架构约束问题。

Method: 使用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)在潜在主子空间进行前向坐标优化，通过更新紧凑的低维向量来增强输出置信度并使潜在表示更接近源潜在分布，模型参数冻结。

Conclusion: TED为边缘设备提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，实现了高效、无遗忘的自适应，具有最小的内存和计算开销。

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational
resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine
learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on
gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently
unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on
backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives
address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack
flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge
devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the
principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only
enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to
the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is
achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and
enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and
computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword
spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets
demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while
$\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a
practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore,
we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$,
demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge
devices in real-world deployments.

TL;DR: 提出CDRL4AD方法，通过因果解缠表示学习来检测多元时间序列中的异常并识别其因果关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列中变量间的动态交互使因果关系解释复杂化，现有方法无法显式推断不同时间段的因果关系

Method: 设计时间异构图表示因果关系，通过解缠潜在变量来推断因果因子，识别不同时间段的因果关联

Result: 在真实数据集上实验表明，CDRL4AD在准确性和根因分析方面优于现有最优方法

Conclusion: 该方法能有效辅助人类专家诊断异常根因，验证了超参数敏感性和时间复杂度的合理性

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate
detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic
interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of
causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence
between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture
feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their
representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over
different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled
Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and
identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we
design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and
causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal
relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to
infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates
hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct
a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the
root causes of anomalies.

TL;DR: PhysioME是一个针对生理信号多模态缺失问题的鲁棒框架，通过自监督学习、双路径网络和恢复解码器，在模态缺失情况下保持稳定性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实医疗应用中生理信号常因硬件限制或运动伪影导致模态缺失，现有方法假设所有模态可用，在缺失情况下性能大幅下降。

Method: 采用多模态自监督学习（对比学习+掩码预测）、双路径网络捕捉时序动态、恢复解码器重建缺失模态，支持不完整输入处理。

Result: PhysioME在各种模态缺失场景下实现了高一致性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: PhysioME在数据不完整的现实临床环境中具有作为可靠决策支持工具的潜力。

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based
medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts.
However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities,
resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any
modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust
framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality
conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach
that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a
Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each
physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs
missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The
experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and
generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting
clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data
availability.

TL;DR: 提出RFTHGS框架，通过强化学习微调小型专用LLM来生成高性能交叉算子，在车辆路径问题中超越专家设计的启发式方法和GPT-4等大型通用模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前依赖大型通用LLM（如GPT-4）作为启发式设计器的范式，证明经过精心微调的小型专用LLM可以生成超越专家设计的组件。

Method: 采用多层级课程奖励函数，逐步引导LLM生成可编译、可执行且性能优越的交叉算子，结合算子缓存机制防止抄袭并促进多样性。

Result: 微调后的LLM生成的交叉算子在HGS求解器中显著优于专家设计的算子，性能优势从1000节点的小规模问题到大规模问题保持一致，且超越神经组合基线、基于提示的方法和商业LLM。

Conclusion: 专用小型LLM经过适当微调可以超越大型通用模型和专家设计，为组合优化问题提供了更高效、专业的解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated
heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current
state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive,
general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by
demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned,
can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced
solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for
the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).
Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that
progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then
executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert
designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages
plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments
show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly
outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains
consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems
with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading
neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such
as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

TL;DR: 提出了MLCM-KD框架，通过双向知识蒸馏解决热成像面部关键点检测中的模态差异问题，实现了高效准确的热成像FLD模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像面部关键点检测在挑战性光照条件下很重要，但缺乏丰富的视觉线索。传统跨模态方法计算昂贵或引入结构伪影，限制了实际部署。

Method: 提出MLCM-KD框架，包含DIKD双向知识蒸馏机制，不仅用RGB特征指导学生，还将学生学到的表征反馈给教师预测头，确保语义一致性。

Result: 在公开热成像FLD基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，显著优于先前方法，同时大幅降低计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了RGB和热成像数据间的模态差异问题，实现了鲁棒且深刻的知识迁移，为热成像FLD提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution
shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary
cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on
features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We
introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that
identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test
distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features
while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations
using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance
directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by
removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed
representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously
tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal
features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and
empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Motivation: 传统多核聚合方法直接最大化基于核的统计量可能导致高度相似的核，这些核捕获的信息重叠度高，限制了聚合的有效性。需要一种方法既能确保核的多样性，又能保持个体核的检验效能。

Conclusion: 通过平衡核多样性和个体检验效能，所提出的方法显著提升了多核聚合检验的效果，为复杂结构化数据的核检验提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured
data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing
power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that
directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly
similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the
effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated
statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance
between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a
trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual
kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This
motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages
information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual
performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous
theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and
control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed
statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for
both two-sample and independence testing.

Result: LSTM获得最佳性能（F1: 0.688），在81%的数据集上排名第一或第二；Informer提供竞争性准确度（F1: 0.683）且训练速度快30%；经典方法在简单合成数据上表现完美但真实数据集上F1分数差2-3倍。

Conclusion: 预测质量主导检测性能，建议复杂模式使用LSTM，效率关键部署使用Informer，资源受限的简单周期性数据使用经典方法，为基于预测的异常检测研究建立了基准。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures,
yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a
comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods
(Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under
a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates
preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four
detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE,
PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first
complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7
categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations
achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688,
ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on
complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1:
0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions
on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on
real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance:
differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than
between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide
evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for
efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data
with resource constraints. The complete implementation and results establish
baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that
emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine
intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role
of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains
largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward
fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical
decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal
that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining
stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic
attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,
which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We
further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a
powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that
enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous
solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex
dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and
correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity
increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary
determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization
autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less
accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both
mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for
designing adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk
applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and
ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by
proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of
complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness
of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust
explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper
investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance
aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest
and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing
the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's
predictive power.

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: EAGer是一种训练自由的生成方法，利用模型不确定性通过令牌熵分布来减少冗余计算并提高性能，根据提示复杂度动态分配计算预算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同提示具有不同复杂度，需要不同的计算需求，但现有方法为每个提示分配相同计算预算，导致计算资源浪费。

Method: 基于令牌熵分布，仅在存在高熵令牌时分支到多个推理路径，并将节省的计算预算重新分配给最需要探索替代路径的实例。

Result: 在AIME 2025等复杂推理基准测试中，EAGer无需访问目标标签即可重新分配预算，在推理长度和Pass@k方面实现最佳效率-性能权衡。当可访问目标标签时，生成令牌减少65%，Pass@k提升37%。

Conclusion: EAGer通过动态计算预算分配，有效减少冗余计算并提升模型性能，为推理语言模型提供了高效的计算资源利用方案。

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

Conclusion: 该研究验证了工具增强强化学习在跨领域泛化方面的潜力，为LLM推理的跨领域应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental
challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on
task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the
"Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences
as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can
interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs
sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot
setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a
bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction,
descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method
delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned
protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs,
when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized
models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation
models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可解释性的检测对齐(DA)方法，用于评估漏洞检测模型预测与真实漏洞位置的匹配程度，揭示了现有模型存在偏差和伪相关问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有机器学习漏洞检测模型只能标记整个源代码函数为易受攻击，而无法精确定位具体易受攻击的代码行，这限制了在软件开发过程中为人类操作者提供有效支持。

Method: 提出检测对齐(DA)方法，量化模型预测中最影响预测的输入源代码行与真实漏洞位置之间的一致性，该方法与模型无关，可适应不同的检测任务。

Result: 分析多个基于学习的漏洞检测器和数据集，发现这些模型的预测持续受到非易受攻击代码行的偏差影响，凸显了偏差和伪相关性的高影响。

Conclusion: 检测对齐方法有效揭示了现有漏洞检测模型存在的偏差问题，强调了在模型评估中考虑预测与真实漏洞位置对齐的重要性。

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system
security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their
now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to
flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than
precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection
granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,
ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,
evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent
work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus
narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more
fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the
presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often
predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we
investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an
explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection
Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines
that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the
vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and
adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze
multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we
show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by
non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and
spurious correlations. The code is available at

Applied to Sea Surface Temperature data, it outperforms standard parallel

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex,
dynamic constraints. This task is particularly challenging in Graph Neural
Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In
this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which
satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector
clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an
iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a
convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable
of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we
introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient
and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet
on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two
classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power
optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型权重的规模和采用持续增长，但当前缺乏对该数据模态的深入理解，压缩算法设计主要依赖手动试错方法，需要更智能的压缩方案。

Method: 提出神经权重压缩(NWC)框架，包含三个关键技术：列向张量分块和归一化、重要性感知训练损失、基于模型输出的推理时误差补偿机制。

Result: 在开源语言模型上的实验表明，NWC在准确率-压缩率权衡方面达到竞争性或最先进水平，特别是在4-6比特精度下，准确率几乎与FP16模型相当。

Conclusion: NWC为语言模型权重压缩提供了一种有效的学习型方法，能够在不显著损失性能的情况下实现高压缩比，解决了传统压缩方法在该领域的局限性。

Abstract: The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming
increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However,
as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good
compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual,
trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression
framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model
weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose
unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,
and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions
rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight
Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model
weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of
autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)
column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training
loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model
outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with
particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly
on par with FP16 models.

Conclusion: SCGL为从信号数据中学习连接图提供了一个原则性框架，在拓扑和几何恢复方面表现出色。

Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network
topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global
geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as
synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In
this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from
observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum
pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral
properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial
Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection
Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian
manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric
structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing
baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: 该统一迭代优化方案能够产生高质量的节点嵌入，为缺乏特征信息的图数据提供有效的半监督学习解决方案。

Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with
node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs,
nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity
and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification
hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and
topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework
that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised
structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised
regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii)
semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through
random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These
components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding
high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently
achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art
approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning
methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical
events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low
availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values.
This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently
address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from
patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent
space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural
network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved
balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data,
demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where
availability of unlabelled data could increase.

Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages
distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the
challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained
models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,
in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the
global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of
individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning
techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address
this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA
matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and
magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning
method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,
which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more
effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,
by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which
encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized
knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a
pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further
improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and
local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model
and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data
scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with
LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance
by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

Conclusion: ST-Vision-LLM框架成功解决了LLM在时空预测中的空间建模和数值处理挑战，为密集城市移动网络的资源管理提供了有效的预测解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best
baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive
experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across
various data-scarce environments.

Conclusion: Gym-TORAX促进了等离子体控制领域的强化学习研究，提供了兼容多种RL算法的标准化环境。

Abstract: This paper presents Gym-TORAX, a Python package enabling the implementation
of Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments for simulating plasma dynamics and
control in tokamaks. Users define succinctly a set of control actions and
observations, and a control objective from which Gym-TORAX creates a Gymnasium
environment that wraps TORAX for simulating the plasma dynamics. The objective
is formulated through rewards depending on the simulated state of the plasma
and control action to optimize specific characteristics of the plasma, such as
performance and stability. The resulting environment instance is then
compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms and libraries and will facilitate
RL research in plasma control. In its current version, one environment is
readily available, based on a ramp-up scenario of the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).

*Wenbo Wu,Qingyi Si,Xiurui Pan,Ye Wang,Jie Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LouisKV是一种高效的KV缓存检索框架，通过语义感知检索策略和细粒度管理方案，在长序列场景下实现4.7倍加速，同时保持接近无损的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KV缓存检索方法存在显著效率和准确性瓶颈，特别是在长输出推理场景中，由于逐令牌检索和粗粒度页面级KV管理导致性能下降。随着大型推理模型的出现，高效处理长序列场景变得日益重要。

Method: 基于关键KV在解码过程中表现出强时间局部性和在输入提示与生成输出中呈现不同分布模式的观察，LouisKV引入语义感知检索策略（仅在语义边界触发检索），解耦的细粒度管理方案（为输入和输出序列定制差异化策略），以及内核级优化（自定义Triton和CUDA内核加速KV聚类和检索）。

Result: 评估显示，LouisKV在多样化长序列任务（包括长输入短输出、短输入长输出和长输入长输出场景）中，相比最先进的KV检索方法实现了高达4.7倍的加速，同时保持接近无损的准确性。

Conclusion: LouisKV通过利用KV的时间局部性和分布特性，结合语义感知检索和细粒度管理，有效解决了长序列场景下KV缓存的内存和效率问题，为大型推理模型的部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in
auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its
practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods
mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.

TL;DR: DiffTSST是一个基于扩散模型的时序数据风格转换框架，通过卷积编码器分离时序数据的内容和风格表示，并使用自监督注意力扩散过程重新组合它们，实现有效的风格转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然风格转换在视觉和语言领域发展成熟，但在时序数据上的方法仍然有限。时序风格转换可以支持数据增强和场景模拟等应用，帮助机器学习模型在数据稀缺领域泛化。

Method: 使用卷积编码器将时序数据解耦为内容和风格表示，通过自监督注意力扩散过程重新组合它们。在推理时，从两个不同序列中提取内容和风格，实现条件生成以实现风格转换。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明DiffTSST实现了有效的风格转换。通过DiffTSST进行数据增强可以改善数据稀缺情况下的异常检测性能。

Conclusion: DiffTSST是一个有效的时序数据风格转换框架，在数据增强和异常检测等实际应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data
remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that
disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further
validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST
improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

Motivation: 现有动态图学习方法主要关注节点与时间的关系，但忽视了历史事件的影响。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上进行了广泛实验来评估和分析EVP。

Conclusion: EVP框架能有效增强现有方法利用历史事件知识的能力。

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic
interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph
learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular
solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic
graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship
between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In
this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning
framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their
ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of
historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to
align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks.
Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate
historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的同步强化学习后训练系统存在资源利用率低和可扩展性有限的问题，需要开发更高效的异步训练方案。

Method: 基于细粒度并行化和rollout-train解耦两个核心设计原则，提供灵活的编程接口，支持完全异步训练架构和高效的rollout机制。

Result: 在相同GPU预算下，ROLL Flash在RLVR任务上实现2.24倍加速，在智能体任务上实现2.72倍加速，异步训练性能与同步训练相当。

Conclusion: ROLL Flash通过异步训练架构显著提升了强化学习后训练的效率，为大规模语言模型的后训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a
crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse
capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training
still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present
ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL
post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:
fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these
principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a
fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout
mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous
execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource
utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash
achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using
the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several
popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve
performance on par with synchronous training.

TL;DR: 提出多视图特征传播(MFP)框架，通过将稀疏特征分割为多个高斯噪声视图进行独立传播，在提升节点分类性能的同时保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图神经网络在特征稀疏或敏感场景下的性能下降和隐私泄露问题。

Method: 将可用特征分割为多个高斯噪声视图，每个视图通过图拓扑独立传播信息，然后聚合生成鲁棒节点嵌入。

Result: 在多个图数据集上，MFP在节点分类任务中优于现有方法，同时显著减少隐私泄露。

Conclusion: MFP为特征缺失或敏感场景下的图学习提供了有效且隐私保护的框架。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

TL;DR: 该论文首次理论分析了批量大小对Adam优化器泛化性能的影响，发现在两层过参数化CNN上，小批量Adam和AdamW可以达成接近零的测试误差，而全批量版本只能收敛到较差的解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论研究主要分析Adam的全批量版本，这与实践中使用的随机版本存在根本差异。随机Adam即使使用极小学习率也不会收敛到全批量对应版本，因此需要理论分析批量大小对Adam泛化的影响。

Method: 理论分析两层过参数化卷积神经网络在图像数据上的表现，比较Adam和AdamW在不同批量大小下的泛化性能，并推导有效权重衰减界限。

Result: 研究发现小批量Adam和AdamW可以达成接近零的测试误差，而全批量版本只能收敛到较差的解。同时证明Adam的有效权重衰减界限严格小于AdamW，解释了为什么Adam需要更敏感的权重衰减参数调优。

Conclusion: 批量大小和权重衰减在Adam优化器的泛化性能中起着关键作用，小批量训练可以显著改善Adam的泛化能力，而Adam比AdamW需要更精细的权重衰减参数调优。

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning,
which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most
existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which
differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD,
stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with
infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization
of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer
over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam
and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error
solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We
further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than
AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$
tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical
role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

Motivation: 研究LLMs如何表示和处理医学知识，为医学任务的微调、去偏置等提供指导。

Method: 使用四种可解释性技术：UMAP投影中间激活、基于梯度的权重显著性、层切除和激活修补。

Result: 发现医学知识主要在模型前半层处理；年龄编码非线性且不连续；疾病进展表示非单调且循环；药物按医学专业而非作用机制聚类；某些模型中间层激活崩溃但最终恢复。

Conclusion: 这些结果可为医学任务LLMs的微调、去学习或去偏置提供指导，建议在特定层应用这些技术。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of medical-domain interpretability in Large
Language Models (LLMs). We study how the LLMs both represent and process
medical knowledge through four different interpretability techniques: (1) UMAP
projections of intermediate activations, (2) gradient-based saliency with
respect to the model weights, (3) layer lesioning/removal and (4) activation
patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a
coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,
diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we
find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's
layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often
encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate
layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is
non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in
Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism
of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B
have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final
layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or
de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model
these techniques should be applied.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing
the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions.
However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly
time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches
in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this
work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),
classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a
consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively
controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which
enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our
approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000
candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs
from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline
significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than
single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove
sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.
Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can
accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for
cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart
necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However,
their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG
systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and
mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To
address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that
reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model
includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial
dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing
test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we
fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label
classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six
different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated
signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces
physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust
performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of
generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable,
low-cost cardiac screening.

Conclusion: 迭代摊销推理方法解决了当前摊销学习方法在大数据集上的扩展性问题，为通用任务适应提供了更强大的理论基础。

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of
reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid
generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,
including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers
and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they
encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context
examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such
methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as
initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they
incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes
amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on
whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.
Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most
methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process
task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address
this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine
solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic
optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with
forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and
extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

Motivation: 级联排序在大规模信息检索系统中广泛使用，但Top-K算子不可微分，阻碍端到端训练。现有方法要么存在目标不一致问题，要么通过矩阵聚合引入梯度冲突，且都需要O(n log n)复杂度。

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information
retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is
non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include
Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics
like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable
sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for
direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix
aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable
approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft
permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K
operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their
dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a
novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.
By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and
avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in
differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public
benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that
DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior
performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In
the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same
computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into
recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal
linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our
implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

Motivation: 整数AI推理在嵌入式系统中显著降低计算复杂度，但量化感知训练仍忽略了整数重新缩放操作的影响，这是整数AI推理中硬件成本较高的操作。

Method: 应用后训练强量化重新缩放乘数，并引入重新缩放感知训练方法，对超低比特宽度的重新缩放乘数进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，即使重新缩放器宽度减少8倍，通过最小增量重新训练也能保持完整精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的嵌入式系统实现了更节能和成本效益更高的AI推理。

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in
embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy
degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the
impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly
operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can
be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to
the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce
Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling
multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the
full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables
more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained
embedded systems.

Motivation: 研究神经网络在推理领域的最新进展主要基于一个训练范式：先对大型语言模型进行下一个词预测预训练，然后用强化学习算法优化。本文旨在从理论上揭示这种范式成功的优化机制。

Method: 提出了一个理论框架来研究混合分布学习，其中包含编码同一任务的短链和长链"思维链"序列。通过奇偶性判断任务的理论分析，证明强化学习如何利用更长的测试时计算来促进学习。在简化设置中，理论证明了自回归线性模型能高效学习奇偶性判断。

Result: 理论证明和实验表明，在长演示序列比例不随输入维度指数减少的情况下，强化学习微调能让模型有效学习复杂推理任务。在Llama系列模型上的实验也验证了相同现象。

Conclusion: 强化学习在下一个词预测预训练后的微调能够有效利用长序列信息，使模型在推理任务上实现泛化，而仅使用下一个词预测则需要指数级统计或计算资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReLook是一个基于视觉的强化学习框架，通过多模态LLM作为工具，实现前端代码生成的生成-诊断-精炼循环，显著提升渲染正确性和交互质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在算法代码生成表现出色，但在前端开发中表现不佳，因为前端正确性需要基于渲染像素和交互来评判。

Method: 使用多模态LLM作为视觉批评家和反馈源，采用强制优化策略确保单调改进，训练时使用视觉奖励，推理时解耦批评家进行轻量级自编辑。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试中，ReLook始终优于强基线模型，在基于视觉的前端代码生成方面表现突出。

Conclusion: ReLook展示了智能感知、视觉奖励以及训练-推理解耦在前端代码生成中的显著优势。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

TL;DR: 提出生成轨迹策略(GTP)，通过统一视角将扩散、流匹配和一致性模型视为ODE控制的生成轨迹，在离线强化学习中实现高性能且计算效率平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在离线RL中存在性能与效率的权衡：扩散策略计算昂贵，一致性策略性能较差。需要一种能超越这些限制的统一方法。

Method: 将现代生成模型统一为学习ODE控制的连续时间生成轨迹，提出GTP学习底层ODE的完整解映射，并引入两个理论上有原则的适配。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于先前生成策略，在多个困难的AntMaze任务上获得完美分数。

Conclusion: GTP成功弥合了生成模型在离线RL中的性能与效率差距，通过统一的ODE视角提供了更清晰的生成策略设计空间。

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline
reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,
multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,
iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while
fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded
performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this
gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,
lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including
diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of
learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer
design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative
Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns
the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical
for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled
adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative
policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆需要能够泛化到未见场景的算法。虽然基于模型的强化学习在多个领域表现出色，但对环境变化敏感，特别是在自动驾驶赛车这种动态环境中。

Method: 将头对头赛车任务建模为上下文马尔可夫决策过程，使用情节上下文参数化对手的驾驶行为，提出上下文感知的cMask扩展方法。

Result: 上下文感知的MBRL算法相比上下文无关方法能更好地泛化到分布外对手行为，cMask在分布内对手行为下也表现出更强的泛化能力和性能提升。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的基于模型强化学习方法，特别是cMask，在自动驾驶赛车任务中具有更好的泛化能力和性能表现。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

Method: MISTAKE方法：(1) 利用错误答案与潜在误解之间的循环一致性构建高质量的错误推理合成示例；(2) 使用生成的数据学习学生模拟、误解分类和答案生成模型。

Result: 在三个教育任务上的评估显示：学生模拟错误答案的准确性更高，从观察到的错误答案推断潜在误解的性能提升，生成错误答案时与专家编写的干扰项对齐度更高。

Conclusion: MISTAKE方法能够有效建模错误推理模式，在教育应用中具有实用价值，特别是在学生错误模拟和误解分析方面表现出色。

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

*Aleksei Rozanov,Samikshya Subedi,Vasudha Sharma,Bryan C. Runck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究结合基于树的知识引导机器学习方法和多光谱遥感数据，在美国中西部地区实现了蒸散发的准确估算，LightGBM模型表现最佳，R²=0.86。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蒸散发在陆气相互作用中至关重要，但现有原位测量方法（如涡度协方差）只能获取单点数据，无法满足农业应用需要大范围田间尺度的蒸散发估算需求。

Method: 使用四种基于树的模型（随机森林、CatBoost、XGBoost、LightGBM）和简单前馈神经网络，结合知识引导的机器学习特征工程，利用多光谱遥感数据、网格化气象数据和涡度协方差数据进行训练验证。

Conclusion: 成功开发了500米空间分辨率和一天时间分辨率的网格化蒸散发数据产品（2019-2024年），与州级气象站估算结果相比具有最佳一致性。

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere
interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal
scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy
covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET
at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field
over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each
location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine
learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled
meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We
compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM -
and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with
features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained
and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using
k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test
split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided
features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =
8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance
analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for
predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a
data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET
for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product
and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class
correspondence.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图表示学习的多跳问题检索框架，通过多信息级别知识图谱和查询特定图神经网络来解决多跳问题中的语义理解和噪声干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多跳问题需要识别多个知识目标来合成答案，这对RAG系统提出了新挑战。现有方法难以充分理解复杂语义结构的问题，且在检索多个信息目标时容易受到无关噪声的影响。

Method: 首先构建多信息级别知识图谱来建模不同信息级别，然后设计查询特定图神经网络进行表示学习，采用层内/层间消息传递机制，并在每次消息传递中由查询引导信息聚合。还提出了两种合成数据生成策略来预训练模型。

Result: 大量实验结果表明该框架在多跳场景中有效，特别是在高跳问题上改进可达33.8%。

Conclusion: 该图表示学习框架能够有效解决多跳问题检索中的挑战，通过多粒度信息聚合和噪声抑制显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance
Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources.
However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple
knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG
systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully
understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible
to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning
framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a
Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various
information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop
questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network
(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs
intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the
information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates
multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the
impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we
further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the
QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the
improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于扩散模型的决策导向学习方法，通过训练扩散模型来表示不确定参数的分布，并使用扩散模型生成的样本来优化决策，从而解决传统DFL方法依赖确定性预测的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的决策导向学习方法通常依赖确定性点预测，无法充分捕捉现实环境中的内在随机性，这限制了决策质量。

Method: 1. 使用重参数化技巧构建扩散DFL框架，支持端到端训练；2. 提出轻量级得分函数估计器，仅需几次前向扩散传递，避免采样过程中的反向传播。

Result: 实证研究表明，该扩散DFL方法在决策质量上始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 扩散DFL方法能够有效处理不确定性，提高决策质量，同时通过轻量级估计器降低了计算和内存需求。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and
optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target
rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods
typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient
to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address
this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains
a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and
optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn
from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate
diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training
through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to
the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we
propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward
diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows
from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be
approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that
our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in
decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the
project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

Motivation: 传统统计套利方法难以在考虑交易成本的情况下最大化风险调整后的收益，需要开发能够联合识别相似资产、错误定价并优化交易策略的框架。

Method: 使用注意力因子作为条件潜在因子，从公司特征嵌入中学习复杂交互，通过通用序列模型从因子残差组合中识别时间序列信号，并联合估计因子和套利交易策略。

Result: 在24年期间对美国最大股票的回测显示，注意力因子模型的样本外夏普比率超过4，考虑交易成本后的净夏普比率达到前所未有的2.3。

Conclusion: 联合学习因子和交易策略对于在交易成本后最大化盈利能力至关重要，弱因子在套利交易中具有重要作用。

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在数学推理任务上主要是在优化基础模型已有的解题能力，而非真正探索新的推理方式，这限制了模型能力的突破。

Method: 构建MATH-B基准测试，该测试专门设计来击败常见开源模型（最多8B参数），即使在大规模采样下也难以解决。问题来源于DAPO-Math-17K和DeepScaleR数据集。

Result: 现有的RL微调模型（如Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B和DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview）在MATH-B基准测试上表现不佳，即使在pass@1024采样下也难以解决。

Conclusion: MATH-B基准测试将推动探索驱动的强化学习方法发展，激发更深层次的推理能力，超越当前方法的局限性。

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.
However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical
limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many
existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math
benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL
fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen
existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such
sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster
exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we
introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat
common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling
budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that
learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated
sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and
DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school
math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as
Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform
poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall
short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze
exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We
release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

Conclusion: 为设计更容易积分的传输过程提供了广泛的指导，揭示了直线流与确定性端点耦合之间的精确对应关系。

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically,
flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target
distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an
ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes
produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration
vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide
a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional
acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.
Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show
that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We
also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general
processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to
integrate.

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following

strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework
offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed
model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower
bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives
once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers
with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction
tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

Result: BGPO在数学问题求解、代码生成和规划任务中显著优于之前的dLLM RL算法

Conclusion: BGPO通过内存高效的RL算法解决了扩散大语言模型训练中的关键瓶颈，实现了更准确的似然近似和更好的性能

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在语言模型强化学习中引入基于表示的多样性探索奖励，发现在推理时和训练后都能显著提高多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究强化学习是否能促进语言模型发现新行为，而不仅仅是优化已有行为，探索预训练模型知识如何指导这种搜索。

Method: 使用基于预训练语言模型隐藏状态的表示多样性奖励，在推理时和训练后阶段进行有意识的探索。

Result: 基于表示的多样性探索显著提高了多样性和pass@k率，在推理时提高了50%以上的验证器效率，在训练后实现了3倍的测试时样本效率提升。

Conclusion: 有意识的探索配合正确的多样性概念是发现新行为的实用途径，而不仅仅是优化已有行为。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language
models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of
novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In
this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly
incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to
understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our
main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,
representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden
states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for
post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For
inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves
efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and
reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%
improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we
show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves
reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL
post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained
Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,
demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our
findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of
diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond
sharpening.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了乐观Hedge算法在两人零和博弈中的遗憾最优性，改进了现有遗憾分析，证明了社交和个体遗憾上界可达O(√log m log n)，并给出了匹配的算法依赖下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在两人零和博弈中，基于乐观Hedge的学习动态在强非耦合设置下具有已知的最佳遗憾上界之一。本研究旨在探究乐观Hedge在遗憾对动作数量m和n依赖关系上的最优性。

Method: 通过将遗憾上界表示为关于学习率和某些负项系数的优化问题，对主导常数进行精细分析；提供算法依赖的个体遗憾下界来证明上界的最优性。

Result: 在已知对手动作数量的强非耦合设置下，社交和个体遗憾上界可改进为O(√log m log n)；证明了这些上界无法进一步改进，且社交遗憾上下界在主导项常数上完全匹配。

Conclusion: 研究结果改进了基于乐观Hedge的学习动态的最后迭代收敛率和动态遗憾，并提供了与改进上界匹配的算法依赖动态遗憾下界。

Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge
achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled
learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and
individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of
actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality
of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this
end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the
strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,
both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m
\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an
optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of
certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We
then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and
individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge
by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,
these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant
factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the
last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic
based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent
dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

TL;DR: QeRL是一个结合量化技术与强化学习的框架，通过NVFP4量化和LoRA技术加速LLM的强化学习训练，同时降低内存需求，并利用量化噪声增强探索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM强化学习训练资源消耗大、内存需求高、训练时间长的问题，同时探索量化噪声对策略探索的积极影响。

Method: 结合NVFP4量化和LoRA技术，引入自适应量化噪声机制动态调整训练过程中的噪声水平，优化探索策略。

Result: 在rollout阶段实现1.5倍加速，首次在单张H100 80GB GPU上训练32B LLM，在数学基准测试中达到GSM8K 90.8%和MATH 500 77.4%的准确率，优于16位LoRA和QLoRA。

Conclusion: QeRL是一个高效且有效的LLM强化学习训练框架，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练效率和降低资源需求。

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

### [525] [Adversarial Attacks Leverage Interference Between Features in Superposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11709)
*Edward Stevinson,Lucas Prieto,Melih Barsbey,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出对抗性漏洞源于神经网络中的高效信息编码机制，特别是叠加现象（网络用较少维度表示更多特征），攻击者可以利用特征间的干扰来生成对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对对抗样本产生原因存在争议，有的认为是决策边界不规则导致的，有的认为是网络对非鲁棒特征的敏感性。本文旨在从信息编码角度解释对抗性漏洞的根源。

Method: 通过分析叠加现象（superposition）如何影响潜在表示，在受控的合成环境中验证叠加足以产生对抗性漏洞，并在CIFAR-10上训练的ViT模型中验证发现。

Result: 证明对抗性扰动利用了叠加特征间的干扰，攻击模式可从特征排列中预测；叠加现象足以产生对抗性漏洞，这一发现在真实模型中持续存在。

Conclusion: 对抗性漏洞可能是网络表示压缩的副产品，而非学习过程缺陷或非鲁棒输入的问题，这为对抗攻击的可迁移性和类别特定漏洞模式提供了机制性解释。

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

Conclusion: 该混合方法通过结合摊销采样和粒子方法的优势，在多模态分布采样任务中取得了更好的性能和稳定性，为复杂分布的高效采样提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for
sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state
a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential
samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein
learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist
functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training
procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt
sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target
distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and
twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training
signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience
replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine
historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay
buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete
spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we
demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as
training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.
