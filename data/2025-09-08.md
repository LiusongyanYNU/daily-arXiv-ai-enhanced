### [1] [Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation via Multiple Foundation Models Mapper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04957)
*Gehui Chen,Guan'an Wang,Xiaowen Huang,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper通过融合双视觉编码器特征和使用GPT-2作为映射器，在视频到音频生成任务中实现了更好的语义和时间一致性，同时训练效率显著提升，仅需之前方法16%的训练量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法需要从头训练模型，资源消耗大。虽然已有工作探索使用预训练基础模型，但单视觉编码器提供的特征有限，线性映射器在特征对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 提出MFM-Mapper方法：1）使用双视觉编码器融合更丰富的语义和时间特征；2）用GPT-2替代线性映射器，将跨模态特征映射视为自回归翻译任务；3）保持训练高效性。

Result: 方法在语义和时间一致性方面表现更好，训练效率显著提升（仅需之前方法16%的训练量），与大规模训练模型相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper通过多基础模型特征融合和GPT-2映射器的创新设计，在视频到音频生成任务中实现了性能提升和训练效率的显著改进。

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

### [2] [Facial Emotion Recognition does not detect feeling unsafe in automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04490)
*Abel van Elburg,Konstantinos Gkentsidis,Mathieu Sarrazin,Sarah Barendswaard,Varun Kotian,Riender Happee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过驾驶模拟器实验研究自动驾驶风险感知，发现车辆运动和皮电导可以预测主观风险感知，而面部表情识别效果不佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自动驾驶车辆的风险感知，探索可靠的客观风险评估方法

Method: 使用32名参与者进行驾驶模拟器实验，测量主观舒适度、运动、面部表情、皮电导、心率和眼动追踪等数据

Result: 动态驾驶风格导致更强不舒适感，行人交互增加风险感知；面部表情识别不可靠，但车辆运动和皮电导的神经网络模型能够预测主观风险感知

Conclusion: 车辆运动和皮电导数据可以作为客观风险感知评估的有效方法，减少主观偏差，为自动驾驶安全研究提供新方向

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [3] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer是一个通用的提示词重写框架，通过强化学习训练思维链重写器，显著提升文本到图像模型对复杂提示词的理解和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂用户提示时存在属性绑定、否定和组合关系等方面的困难，导致用户意图与生成结果不匹配。

Method: 提出PromptEnhancer框架，通过强化学习训练思维链重写器，使用专门的AlignEvaluator奖励模型提供细粒度反馈，基于24个关键点的系统分类法进行优化。

Result: 在HunyuanImage 2.1模型上的广泛实验表明，PromptEnhancer在广泛的语义和组合挑战中显著提高了图像-文本对齐度。

Conclusion: 该框架无需修改预训练模型权重即可提升任何T2I模型性能，并引入了新的人类偏好基准以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

*Hongyang Wei,Baixin Xu,Hongbo Liu,Cyrus Wu,Jie Liu,Yi Peng,Peiyu Wang,Zexiang Liu,Jingwen He,Yidan Xietian,Chuanxin Tang,Zidong Wang,Yichen Wei,Liang Hu,Boyi Jiang,William Li,Ying He,Yang Liu,Xuchen Song,Eric Li,Yahui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext是一个2B参数的DiT模型，基于SD3.5-Medium架构，通过渐进式双任务强化策略实现了最先进的图像生成和编辑能力，并在统一多模态框架中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前许多开源多模态模型过于注重参数规模扩展而忽视训练策略优化，限制了效率和性能。本文旨在通过优化训练策略来提升模型能力。

Method: 采用SD3.5-Medium架构改进，进行大规模高质量数据预训练，提出渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)，并将图像模型与Qwen2.5-VL-7B连接构建统一多模态模型。

Result: 模型在图像生成和编辑方面超越了参数规模更大的模型(BAGEL 7B和Flux-Kontext 12B)，统一多模态模型UniPic2-Metaquery在多种任务上达到顶级性能。

Conclusion: 提出的训练范式Skywork UniPic 2.0被证明是有效且具有泛化性的，能够以简单可扩展的方式实现理解、生成和编辑的统一集成。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [5] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag是一个基于像素空间双向变形和图像修复的拖拽式图像编辑框架，实现了实时变形预览和高效修复，显著提升了交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拖拽式图像编辑方法主要依赖生成模型的潜在空间操作，导致精度有限、反馈延迟和模型特定约束。

Method: 将拖拽编辑分解为像素空间双向变形和图像修复，将图像区域视为可变形材料，保持用户操作下的自然形状。

Result: 在512x512分辨率下实现实时变形预览(0.01秒)和高效修复(0.3秒)，相比需要数分钟编辑的现有方法显著提升交互体验。

Conclusion: 该方法作为通用适配器，无需架构修改即可适用于任何修复模型，自动继承修复技术的所有未来改进，在保持实时性能的同时实现卓越的视觉质量和精确控制。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [6] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH是首个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，采用'再生与修正'策略，通过扩散模型生成良性图像来消除对抗补丁攻击，无需预先了解攻击信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的物体检测器容易受到对抗补丁攻击，可能导致严重后果。理想的防御方法需要具备有效性、泛化性和对自适应攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 利用扩散模型的生成能力重新生成整个图像，使其与良性数据对齐，然后通过修正过程识别并替换对抗区域为再生的良性对应部分。

Result: 在多种检测器和攻击测试中，DISPATCH在隐藏攻击上达到89.3%的mAP.5分数，在非目标创建攻击上将攻击成功率降低至24.8%，且对自适应攻击保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DISPATCH是一种实用可靠的物体检测系统防御方法，具有攻击无关性和无需先验知识的优势。

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

### [7] [WATCH: World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04600)
*Qijun Ying,Zhongyuan Hu,Rui Zhang,Ronghui Li,Yu Lu,Zijiao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH是一个统一的框架，通过航向角分解和相机轨迹整合机制，解决了单目视频中全局人体运动重建的深度模糊和运动模糊问题，在轨迹重建方面达到了最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单目视频进行全局人体运动重建时的深度模糊、运动模糊以及相机与人体运动纠缠问题，特别是现有方法在相机方向信息利用和相机平移线索整合方面的不足。

Method: 提出了WATCH框架，包含解析性航向角分解技术和受世界模型启发的相机轨迹整合机制，能够高效利用相机方向信息和平移信息。

Result: 在野外基准测试中实现了端到端轨迹重建的最先进性能，证明了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决相机平移整合这一长期挑战提供了新的见解，代码将公开可用。

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

### [8] [Sali4Vid: Saliency-Aware Video Reweighting and Adaptive Caption Retrieval for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04602)
*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid是一个简单有效的显著性感知框架，通过视频重加权和自适应字幕检索来解决密集视频字幕任务中的时间戳监督和场景转换问题，在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上达到最先进效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端模型存在两个局限：(1)仅对文本应用时间戳监督，而将所有视频帧同等对待；(2)从固定大小的视频块中检索字幕，忽略了场景转换。

Method: 提出Sali4Vid框架，包含两个核心组件：显著性感知视频重加权（将时间戳标注转换为基于sigmoid的帧重要性权重）和基于语义的自适应字幕检索（通过帧相似性分割视频以捕捉场景转换并改进字幕检索）。

Result: 在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 联合改进视频加权和检索对密集视频字幕任务有益，Sali4Vid框架简单有效。

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

### [10] [VCMamba: Bridging Convolutions with Multi-Directional Mamba for Efficient Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04669)
*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba是一个结合CNN局部特征提取能力和Mamba SSM全局建模能力的视觉骨干网络，在ImageNet和ADE20K上实现了优异性能且参数更少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补CNN缺乏全局建模能力和ViT/SSM缺乏细粒度局部特征提取能力的不足，整合两者的优势

Method: 使用卷积stem和分层结构，早期阶段用卷积块提取局部特征，后期阶段用多方向Mamba块建模长距离依赖和全局上下文

Result: ImageNet-1K达到82.6% top-1准确率，比PlainMamba-L3高0.3%且参数少37%；ADE20K达到47.1 mIoU，比EfficientFormer-L7高2.0 mIoU且参数少62%

Conclusion: VCMamba成功整合了CNN和Mamba SSM的优势，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的特征表示能力

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at
https://github.com/Wertyuui345/VCMamba.

*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多智能体训练免费框架，通过Worker-Supervisor迭代架构协调通用视觉语言模型，实现复杂文本标注指南下的语义分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中的语义分割不仅需要准确掩码，还要严格遵守复杂的文本标注指南。传统方法需要昂贵的任务特定重训练，而现有开放词汇分割方法在处理段落级复杂指南时表现不佳。

Method: 多智能体训练免费框架，包含Worker执行分割、Supervisor根据检索到的指南进行批判、轻量级强化学习停止策略决定循环终止时机。

Result: 在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上显著优于最先进基线方法，展现出强大的泛化能力和指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了复杂标注指南下的语义分割问题，无需重训练即可适应指南变化，在保持资源效率的同时确保指南一致性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

### [12] [Domain Adaptation for Different Sensor Configurations in 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04711)
*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对不同传感器配置导致的3D物体检测性能下降问题，提出了下游微调和部分层微调两种技术，在多数据集训练后通过特定配置的微调来提升跨配置泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同自动驾驶车辆平台使用不同的LiDAR传感器配置，导致点云分布差异，使得在一个配置上训练的模型在其他配置上性能下降。现有研究主要关注环境域差距和单一LiDAR内的密度变化，而不同传感器配置间的域差距研究较少。

Method: 提出两种技术：1）下游微调 - 在多数据集训练后进行数据集特定的微调；2）部分层微调 - 只更新部分网络层以提高跨配置泛化能力。使用同一地理区域采集的多传感器配置配对数据集进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，联合训练结合下游微调和部分层微调的方法，在每种配置上都持续优于简单的联合训练方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为3D物体检测模型适应多样化车辆平台提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，有效解决了不同传感器配置间的域适应问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

*Tianxiang Xue,Jiayi Zhao,Jingsheng Li,Changlu Chen,Kun Zhan*

TL;DR: 提出CD-Mamba混合模型，结合卷积神经网络和Mamba状态空间建模，用于遥感图像云检测，能同时处理局部纹理细节和长程依赖关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像常被云层遮挡，影响数据完整性。云检测需要同时处理短程空间冗余和长程大气相似性，现有方法难以兼顾局部和全局特征

Method: 集成卷积神经网络（处理局部空间依赖）和Mamba状态空间建模（处理长程依赖）的混合架构CD-Mamba，能同时捕获像素级纹理细节和补丁级长程依赖

Result: 大量实验验证了CD-Mamba的有效性，在检测精度上优于现有方法，能够处理不同空间尺度的云检测任务

Conclusion: CD-Mamba成功整合了卷积和Mamba的优势，为遥感图像云检测提供了有效的混合解决方案，在准确性和多尺度处理能力方面表现优异

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance

TL;DR: 提出Task Consistency Training (TCT)框架解决医学图像分割中的类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型，通过一致性约束和过滤策略有效利用未标注数据


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中获取全类别标注成本高昂，部分标注数据集存在严重类别不平衡问题，现有方法需要额外模型且易受标签噪声影响

Method: TCT框架包含主分割头和多个辅助任务头，通过一致性约束利用未标注解剖结构，采用过滤策略排除低一致性噪声数据，引入统一辅助不确定性加权损失

Result: 在8个腹部数据集上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: TCT框架能够有效解决类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型，在多样化临床数据集上表现优异

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对SAM和SAM2在恶劣天气条件下分割性能下降的问题，提出了两种不确定性感知方法：多步微调SAM2和适配UAT到驾驶场景，在多个驾驶数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM和SAM2）在视觉模糊性高的恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，缺乏不确定性量化能力，而自动驾驶等安全关键应用需要更可靠的分割性能。

Method: 1. 为SAM2设计多步微调程序，将不确定性指标直接融入损失函数；2. 将医学影像中的不确定性感知适配器（UAT）适配到自动驾驶场景。

Result: 在CamVid、BDD100K和GTA驾驶数据集上的实验表明：UAT-SAM在极端天气下优于标准SAM，而带有不确定性感知损失的SAM2在各种驾驶场景中都获得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 显式的不确定性建模对于在挑战性环境中进行安全关键自动驾驶具有重要价值，不确定性感知方法能显著提升分割模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based
HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component

a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while
maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal

realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and

TL;DR: MCANet是一个多标签分类框架，通过多尺度特征学习和类别特定的残差注意力机制，显著提升了飓风后无人机图像中的多类别损坏检测性能，在RescueNet数据集上达到91.75%的mAP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN方法难以捕捉多尺度空间特征，且无法有效区分视觉相似或共现的损坏类型，这限制了飓风后快速准确损坏评估的能力。

Method: 采用Res2Net分层主干网络丰富多尺度空间上下文，结合多头类别特定残差注意力模块，每个注意力分支关注不同空间粒度，平衡局部细节和全局上下文。

Result: 在4,494张无人机图像数据集上，MCANet达到91.75% mAP，优于多个基准模型。使用8个注意力头时性能进一步提升至92.35%，对Road Blocked等困难类别的AP提升超过6%。

Conclusion: MCANet能够准确定位损坏相关区域，支持可解释性，其输出可为灾后风险评估、应急路由和数字孪生灾害响应提供信息。未来可集成灾害知识图谱和多模态大语言模型提升适应性。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设视频中人群不变，无法处理动态变化的群体结构，需要同时考虑局部外观特征和全局场景上下文

Method: 使用组检测增强的Vision-Language Model(VLM)提取每帧的局部和全局特征，通过全局优化图对所有帧的群体概率进行动态检测

Result: 在公开数据集上表现超过了现有的state-of-the-art群体检测方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测视频中动态变化的人群，通过VLM特征提取和全局优化实现了更准确的群体检测

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

Motivation: 现有计算机视觉洪水检测方法存在精度限制和泛化能力差的问题，依赖于固定物体检测器和特定任务训练，需要开发能够跨不同洪水场景准确估计深度的通用方法。

Method: 结合GPT-4o的语义推理能力和结构化领域知识图谱，动态识别RGB图像中的参考物体，从知识图谱检索验证高度以减少幻觉，估计淹没比例，并应用统计异常值过滤计算最终深度值。

Result: 在MyCoast New York的110张众包图像上评估，平均绝对误差为8.17厘米，比GPT-4o基线降低20.5%，优于之前的CNN方法，能够良好泛化到不同场景并近乎实时运行。

Conclusion: FloodVision框架为智能城市洪水韧性提供了有效的零样本深度估计解决方案，适合集成到数字孪生平台和公民报告应用中。

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学MRI影像在切片维度空间分辨率低的问题，需要一种能够保持纹理和精细解剖细节的超分辨率方法。

Method: 使用MLP-Mixers与卷积层结合的单维度SRGAN架构，在MSSEG2数据集上训练，并在多个临床数据集上进行验证。

Result: MLP-SRGAN产生更锐利的边缘、更少的模糊，保留更多纹理和精细解剖细节，参数量更少，训练/评估时间更快，模型尺寸更小。

Conclusion: MLP-SRGAN是一种有效的医学影像超分辨率方法，在性能和效率方面都优于现有技术。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture called MLP-SRGAN, which is a single-dimension
Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) that utilizes
Multi-Layer Perceptron Mixers (MLP-Mixers) along with convolutional layers to
upsample in the slice direction. MLP-SRGAN is trained and validated using high
resolution (HR) FLAIR MRI from the MSSEG2 challenge dataset. The method was
applied to three multicentre FLAIR datasets (CAIN, ADNI, CCNA) of images with
low spatial resolution in the slice dimension to examine performance on
held-out (unseen) clinical data. Upsampled results are compared to several
state-of-the-art SR networks. For images with high resolution (HR) ground
truths, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index
(SSIM) are used to measure upsampling performance. Several new structural,
no-reference image quality metrics were proposed to quantify sharpness (edge
strength), noise (entropy), and blurriness (low frequency information) in the
absence of ground truths. Results show MLP-SRGAN results in sharper edges, less
blurring, preserves more texture and fine-anatomical detail, with fewer
parameters, faster training/evaluation time, and smaller model size than
existing methods. Code for MLP-SRGAN training and inference, data generators,
models and no-reference image quality metrics will be available at

Result: 在五个常用基准测试上R@1指标提升1.6%~3.9%，效率与Two-Tower模型相当，性能接近state-of-the-art

Conclusion: 混合塔框架成功结合了两种框架的优势，在保持高效率的同时显著提升了检索效果

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Motivation: 月球探测需要准确的图像注册来支持表面成图、资源定位和任务规划，但不同传感器（光学、超谱、雷达）的数据对齐面临着分辨率、照明和传感器异常等挑战。

Method: 评估五种特征匹配算法（SIFT、ASIFT、AKAZE、RIFT2和SuperGlue），使用越赤道和极地区域的交叉模态图像对。提出包括地理参考、分辨率对齐、强度归一化以及适应性直方图均衡、主成分分析、阴影缩正等增强技术的预处理流程。

Result: SuperGlue一贯地对现最低的根均方误差和最快的运行时间。经典方法如SIFT和AKAZE在越赤道附近表现良好，但在极地照明条件下性能会下降。

Conclusion: 结果强调了预处理和基于学习的方法对于在多样化条件下实现稳健的月球图像注册的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的方法在移动设备皮肤病分类中具有巨大潜力，为资源有限环境下的AI辅助皮肤病筛查和早期诊断开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological

Motivation: 提高计算机视觉模型在安全关键应用（如交通场景感知）中的可靠性，需要准确且良好校准的预测不确定性估计。

Method: 研究三种从MoE中提取预测不确定性估计的方法：预测熵、互信息和专家方差；使用A2D2数据集训练具有两个专家的MoE模型；评估路由不确定性（通过门熵计算）和不同门控机制的效果。

Result: MoE在OOD数据下比集成方法产生更可靠的不确定性估计；简单门控机制比复杂类门控具有更好的路由不确定性校准；增加专家数量可以进一步提高不确定性校准。

Conclusion: 混合专家模型是量化预测不确定性的有效方法，能够提供良好校准的不确定性估计，在安全关键应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出LFMT框架，结合Mamba和Transformer优势，通过子空间简单扫描策略和双阶段建模，实现光场图像超分辨率的高效特征提取和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在光场超分辨率中存在多方向扫描策略效率低下和特征冗余问题，且状态空间在保持空间-角度和视差信息方面存在局限。

Method: 提出子空间简单扫描策略(Sub-SS)和子空间简单Mamba块(SSMB)；采用双阶段建模：第一阶段用空间-角度残差子空间Mamba块(SA-RSMB)进行浅层特征提取，第二阶段用极平面Mamba块(EPMB)和极平面Transformer块(EPTB)的双分支并行结构进行深度特征精炼。

Result: LFMT在真实和合成光场数据集上显著优于当前最先进方法，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的实质性提升。

Conclusion: LFMT成功整合了Mamba和Transformer的优势，能够全面探索空间、角度和极平面域的信息，为光场超分辨率提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端方法仅依赖指代目标进行监督，忽略了潜在前景目标的益处，且缺乏多粒度判别能力，在复杂场景中目标识别不够鲁棒。

Method: 提出Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS)模块，在句子和词汇级别使用对比学习；设计Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD)模块，融合对象和语义级信息。

Result: 在gRefCOCO、Ref-ZOM、R-RefCOCO和RefCOCO等多个基准测试中证明了有效性。

Conclusion: PropVG框架成功解决了现有方法的局限性，在视觉定位任务中表现出色，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniFHT是一个无姿态的3D折射率重建框架，通过傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示，实现了高通量流式细胞术中任意几何形状和复杂旋转细胞的高保真成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D定量相位成像方法假设细胞进行均匀单轴旋转，限制了其仅适用于近球形细胞，无法准确成像具有复杂旋转的不规则形状细胞，导致只能分析细胞群体的子集。

Method: 利用傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示(INRs)，联合优化每个细胞的未知旋转轨迹和体积结构，在弱散射假设下支持任意细胞几何形状和多轴旋转。

Result: 能够从稀疏采样投影和有限角度覆盖中实现准确重建，仅需10个视图或120度角度范围即可获得高保真结果。

Conclusion: OmniFHT首次实现了整个流动细胞群体的原位高通量断层成像，为流式细胞术平台提供了可扩展且无偏见的无标记形态计量分析解决方案。

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

*Hannah Schieber,Dominik Frischmann,Simon Boche,Victor Schaack,Angela Schoellig,Stefan Leutenegger,Daniel Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe-GS是一种基于语义高斯泼溅的移动重建方法，通过粗粒度语义分割和颜色过滤快速隔离感兴趣对象，将训练时间减少到完整训练周期的四分之一，同时保持高质量的新视角合成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动自主空中机器人需要快速准确的3D重建，特别是在遥操作和灾难响应等关键应用中。传统方法重建整个场景效率低下，而专注于特定感兴趣对象(PoIs)可以显著提高效率。

Method: 首先使用语义高斯泼溅生成粗粒度可分割场景，然后通过新颖的基于颜色的有效过滤方法对语义对象进行精细化处理，实现有效的对象隔离。

Result: 在两个数据集(SCRREAM真实户外场景和NeRDS 360合成室内场景)上验证，显示运行时间减少且新视角合成质量更高，训练时间约为完整语义高斯泼溅训练周期的四分之一。

Conclusion: CoRe-GS方法成功平衡了高质量重建和减少训练时间的需求，为移动机器人应用提供了高效的语义3D重建解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

TL;DR: Cryo-RL是一个基于强化学习的冷冻消融针放置规划框架，通过模拟临床环境和奖励函数学习最优策略，在583例前列腺癌病例中表现优于自动化基线方法，达到专家水平且规划时间大幅减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前列腺癌冷冻消融治疗的手术前规划依赖人工经验，耗时且质量不稳定，需要自动化解决方案来提高治疗质量和可扩展性。

Method: 将冷冻消融针放置规划建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用强化学习框架在模拟环境中顺序选择消融针位置和冰球直径，通过基于肿瘤覆盖率的奖励函数学习最优策略。

Result: 在583例回顾性病例中，Cryo-RL相比最佳几何优化基线方法Dice系数提升超过8个百分点，达到人类专家水平，且规划时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够提供临床可行、可重复且高效的冷冻消融规划方案，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了使用预训练计算机视觉模型预测对蜘蛛图片的恐惧程度，为调整式治疗提供基础。模型达到了10.1-11.0的平均绝对误差，并通过可解释性分析验证了模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了开发适应式计算机化暴露治疗系统，需要能够根据患者反应动态调整视觉刺激物。本研究重点考察预训练计算机视觉模型是否能准确预测人类对蜘蛛图片的恐惧程度。

Method: 采用过传转学习方法，适配了三个不同的预训练计算机视觉模型。使用313张标准化蜘蛛图片数据集，预测0-100分的恐惧评分。通过交叉验证评估模型性能，进行学习曲线分析和可解释性评估。

Result: 模型平均绝对误差(MAE)在10.1-11.0之间。学习曲线分析显示数据集大小减少会明显影响性能，但过大数据集也无显著改善。可解释性分析证明模型基于蜘蛛相关特征进行预测。错误分析发现远距离视图和人工/涂鸦蜘蛛图片导致更高的预测错误。

Conclusion: 研究证明了可解释性计算机视觉模型在预测恐惧评分中的潜力，强调了模型可解释性和充足数据集大小对开发有效情感感知治疗技术的重要性。

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

TL;DR: 通过视觉语言模型和3D渡染式渲染引擎生成合成的锈边检测数据集，训练出的模型在实际锈边检测任务中达到了0.87的mAP50分数，超过其他方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业设备磨损检测对预测性维护至关重要，但真实数据收集成本高、时间长，且缺乏多种磨损场景的数据集

Method: 结合视觉语言模型与3D模拟渲染引擎，生成不同锈边条件下的合成数据用于训练视觉检测模型

Result: 使用合成数据训练的锈边检测模型在真实工业物体图片上达到了mAP50 0.87的高分，表现超过其他方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决工业磨损检测中数据缺乏问题，具有可自定制性和扩展性，可应用于其他工业磨损检测场景

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

TL;DR: 一种简单的注意力基础多实例学习框架用于皮腺细胞图像分析，基线MLP模型比注意力MIL更稳定


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动计数皮腺细胞内脂豆芽耐耗且主观，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 使用Nile Red染色图像，分为14个类别，通过数据增强扩展到50,000个细胞。比较基线MLP模型和注意力基础MIL模型

Result: 基线MLP平均MAE=5.6，表现更稳定；注意力MIL平均MAE=10.7，不如MLP稳定但在某些折叠中更优

Conclusion: 简单的包级聚合提供了健壃的基线，注意力MIL需要任务对齐池化和正则化才能充分发挥潜力

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

TL;DR: UniView是一种新颖的单图像新视角合成方法，通过检索相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，使用多模态大语言模型辅助选择参考图像，并采用多级隔离层的适配器模块和分离三重注意力机制来改善合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像新视角合成任务由于未观察区域存在多种解释而高度不适定，现有方法往往从模糊先验和输入视图附近的插值生成不可见区域，导致严重失真。

Method: 构建检索和增强系统，利用多模态大语言模型选择符合条件的参考图像；引入带多级隔离层的即插即用适配器模块动态生成目标视图的参考特征；设计分离三重注意力机制有效对齐和整合多分支特征。

Result: 大量实验证明UniView显著提升了新视角合成性能，在具有挑战性的数据集上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，UniView有效解决了单图像新视角合成中的失真问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GD^2Fusion是一个新的红外-可见光图像融合框架，通过视觉语言模型进行退化感知，结合频域和空间域联合优化，在双源退化场景中实现卓越的融合性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外-可见光图像融合方法假设高质量输入，难以处理双源退化场景，需要手动选择和顺序应用多个预增强步骤，导致误差累积和性能下降。

Method: 提出引导双域融合(GD^2Fusion)框架：1) 引导频域模态特定提取(GFMSE)模块进行频域退化感知和抑制；2) 引导空间模态聚合融合(GSMAF)模块进行跨模态退化过滤和自适应多源特征聚合。

Result: 大量定性和定量实验表明，GD^2Fusion在双源退化场景中相比现有算法和策略实现了更优越的融合性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过视觉语言模型与双域联合优化的协同整合，有效解决了双源退化场景下的图像融合问题，代码将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,
and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest
accuracy (99.7%) and perfect sensitivity for malignant lesions. Classical ML
models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical
workflows and demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-performing,
interpretable systems for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection.

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

Abstract: The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with
mobile-enabled convolutional neural networks (MbNets) to enhance Arabic
Handwritten Character Recognition (AHCR). Addressing challenges like extensive
computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three
TL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from
scratch--using four lightweight MbNets: MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and
ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will
explore architectural modifications, in-depth dataset feature analysis, data
augmentation, and advanced sensitivity analysis to enhance model robustness and
generalizability.

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

TL;DR: ADClick是一个交互式图像分割算法，通过少量用户点击和文本描述生成像素级异常标注，显著提升异常检测模型性能。ADClick-Seg通过跨模态框架结合视觉特征和文本提示，在工业异常检测任务中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业产品检测通常只使用正常样本训练异常检测模型，虽然可以收集缺陷样本但需要像素级标注，限制了可扩展性。需要一种更高效的标注方法来利用缺陷样本。

Method: 提出ADClick交互式图像分割算法，通过少量用户点击和文本描述生成像素级异常标注。进一步提出ADClick-Seg跨模态框架，通过基于原型的方法对齐视觉特征和文本提示，结合像素级先验和语言引导线索。

Result: ADClick在MVTec AD上达到AP=96.1%的优异性能。ADClick-Seg在"多类"异常检测任务上取得AP=80.0%、PRO=97.5%、Pixel-AUROC=99.1%的state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: ADClick和ADClick-Seg通过交互式标注和跨模态融合，实现了高效精确的工业异常检测，显著提升了模型性能，为工业检测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited

substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

Abstract: The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, the commonly used
ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D
data, size mismatches, and inadequate class differentiation, which hinder model
performance. This paper introduces ModelNet-R, a meticulously refined version
of ModelNet40 designed to address these issues and serve as a more reliable
benchmark. Additionally, this paper proposes Point-SkipNet, a lightweight
graph-based neural network that leverages efficient sampling, neighborhood
grouping, and skip connections to achieve high classification accuracy with
reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably,
Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a
substantially lower parameter count compared to contemporary models. This
research highlights the crucial role of dataset quality in optimizing model
efficiency for 3D point cloud classification. For more details, see the code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用低阶几何先验（如法向量），且通过噪声敏感方法估计不可靠。需要更鲁棒的几何约束来改进高斯溅射的优化过程。

Method: 提出GeoSplat框架，利用主曲率初始化高斯尺度，基于局部流形等几何结构引入高效且抗噪声的估计方法，为训练提供动态几何先验。

Result: 在多个数据集上的新颖视图合成实验中，GeoSplat显著提升了高斯溅射的性能，超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: GeoSplat通过引入高阶几何先验和鲁棒估计方法，有效改进了高斯溅射的优化过程，为3D重建提供了更好的几何约束框架。

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

TL;DR: 通过结合CNN特征提取能力和Transformer关系建模能力的混合深度学习模型SIT，显式建模多尺度视觉线索之间的交互作用，在自动面部美学预测任务上创造了新的最高水准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN模型在固定尺度处理信息，容易忽略不同粒度级特征之间的关联性，而面部美学评估需要考虑局部和全局特征的复杂交互作用。

Method: 设计了尺度交互Transformer(SIT)混合模型，首先使用并行卷积的多尺度模块捕捉不同感受野下的面部特征，然后将多尺度表征构造为序列并通过Transformer编码器进行关系建模。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500数据集上达到现有最高水准，Pearson相关系数为0.9187，超过了之前的所有方法。

Conclusion: 显式建模多尺度视觉线索之间的交互作用对高性能面部美学预测至关重要，SIT模型为需要全局上下文理解的复杂图像回归任务展示了混合CNN-Transformer模型的潜力。

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

Method: 基于ARC-AGI的问题设置，构建基于规则的任务，对网格环境中的对象应用一组可互操作的变换，支持可调整深度的组合，并提供对网格参数化和对象属性的广泛控制。

Result: 生成了数百万个独特任务规则，比现有数据集大几个数量级，覆盖了广泛的难度范围，并且每个规则可以生成几乎无限的样本。基线实验显示最先进的视觉模型虽然域内性能强，但在新组合的泛化方面持续失败。

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is
key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in
state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce
COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark
designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual
domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs
rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain
performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to
support continued research in this field.

Motivation: 传统CNN对抗对抗性攻击的鲁棒性提升方法通常需要大量资源，探索通过稀疏MoE层在不增加推理成本的情况下提高模型容量和鲁棒性

Method: 在ResNet架构的深层阶段插入单个MoE层替代选定的残差块或卷积层，结合对抗训练，使用switch loss进行专家平衡

Result: 在CIFAR-100上训练的ResNet显示，MoE层结合对抗训练能持续提升PGD和AutoPGD攻击下的鲁棒性；switch loss导致路由崩溃到少数过度使用的专家，意外使这些路径更鲁棒

Conclusion: 稀疏MoE层是提升CNN鲁棒性的有效方法，路由崩溃现象表明鲁棒子路径通过专业化出现，某些个体专家甚至比门控MoE模型更具鲁棒性

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

Motivation: 解决现实应用中源数据因隐私或计算成本无法共享的问题，特别是在标记目标数据稀缺且需要连续值输出的神经科学场景

Method: 基于Contradistinguisher框架，开发了CRAFT方法，用于源数据不可用的半监督预训练模型迁移，无需中间表示对齐

Result: 在EEG眼动预测和MRI脑年龄预测任务中，CRAFT比微调模型RMSE提升9%，比四种先进源无关域适应方法性能提升3%以上

Conclusion: CRAFT是生物学和医学中普遍存在的回归任务的高效源无关半监督深度迁移方法

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

Abstract: We present WinT3R, a feed-forward reconstruction model capable of online
prediction of precise camera poses and high-quality point maps. Previous
methods suffer from a trade-off between reconstruction quality and real-time
performance. To address this, we first introduce a sliding window mechanism
that ensures sufficient information exchange among frames within the window,
thereby improving the quality of geometric predictions without large
computation. In addition, we leverage a compact representation of cameras and
maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera
pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,
camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

Conclusion: SGS-3D通过语义和几何信息的有效协同，能够产生高保真度的3D对象实例，解决了现有2D-3D提升方法的分割精度问题

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Conclusion: 符号图形编程为跨模态基础提供了精确且可解释的视角，RL方法能有效提升LLMs的SVG生成能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

### [54] [REMOTE: A Unified Multimodal Relation Extraction Framework with Multilevel Optimal Transport and Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04844)
*Xinkui Lin,Yongxiu Xu,Minghao Tang,Shilong Zhang,Hongbo Xu,Hao Xu,Yubin Wang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的多模态关系提取框架REMOTE，通过多级最优传输和专家混合机制，能够同时提取文本实体和视觉对象之间的模态内和模态间关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态关系提取方法通常只能提取单一类型的关系三元组，无法处理超出指定类型的三元组，且直接组合这些方法无法捕捉动态的跨模态交互并带来计算冗余

Method: 使用专家混合机制动态选择不同关系三元组类型的最优交互特征，采用多级最优传输融合模块保留低层特征同时维持多层编码，创建了统一多模态关系提取(UMRE)数据集

Result: REMOTE能有效提取各种类型的关系三元组，在两个其他公共MRE数据集上几乎所有指标都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该框架解决了现有方法的局限性，提供了统一的多模态关系提取解决方案，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能

Abstract: Multimodal relation extraction (MRE) is a crucial task in the fields of
Knowledge Graph and Multimedia, playing a pivotal role in multimodal knowledge
graph construction. However, existing methods are typically limited to
extracting a single type of relational triplet, which restricts their ability
to extract triplets beyond the specified types. Directly combining these
methods fails to capture dynamic cross-modal interactions and introduces
significant computational redundancy. Therefore, we propose a novel
\textit{unified multimodal Relation Extraction framework with Multilevel
Optimal Transport and mixture-of-Experts}, termed REMOTE, which can
simultaneously extract intra-modal and inter-modal relations between textual
entities and visual objects. To dynamically select optimal interaction features
for different types of relational triplets, we introduce mixture-of-experts
mechanism, ensuring the most relevant modality information is utilized.
Additionally, considering that the inherent property of multilayer sequential
encoding in existing encoders often leads to the loss of low-level information,
we adopt a multilevel optimal transport fusion module to preserve low-level
features while maintaining multilayer encoding, yielding more expressive
representations. Correspondingly, we also create a Unified Multimodal Relation
Extraction (UMRE) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework,
encompassing diverse cases where the head and tail entities can originate from
either text or image. Extensive experiments show that REMOTE effectively
extracts various types of relational triplets and achieves state-of-the-art
performanc on almost all metrics across two other public MRE datasets. We
release our resources at https://github.com/Nikol-coder/REMOTE.

TL;DR: Q-SafeML是一种针对量子机器学习的安全监控方法，通过量子中心距离度量来检测概念漂移，提升系统透明度和安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习在安全关键系统中应用日益增多，但现有经典ML安全监控方法不适用于QML，需要专门的安全机制

Method: 基于SafeML方法，采用量子中心距离度量来评估模型准确性，进行模型依赖的后分类评估，检测操作数据与训练数据之间的距离

Result: 在QCNN和VQC模型上的实验表明，该方法能够实现知情的人类监督

Conclusion: Q-SafeML为量子机器学习提供了有效的安全监控解决方案，解决了概念漂移问题并增强了系统安全性

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

TL;DR: 提出Exploratory Iteration (ExIt)方法，通过选择性采样信息量最大的中间状态来训练LLM进行多步自我改进，在推理时实现超越训练步数的迭代能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法在自我改进任务中假设固定的最大迭代深度，这既昂贵又随意。需要一种能够利用自我改进任务循环结构的方法，让模型在推理时进行多步自我改进

Method: ExIt方法通过选择性采样训练过程中遇到的最具信息量的中间部分历史记录，将这些起点作为新的自我迭代任务实例来训练自我改进策略，可与显式探索机制结合维持任务多样性

Result: 在数学竞赛、多轮工具使用和机器学习工程等多个领域，ExIt策略能够产生在保留任务实例上表现出强大推理时自我改进能力的策略，并能在超出训练时平均迭代深度的步数预算内迭代到更高性能

Conclusion: ExIt方法有效解决了自我改进任务中的迭代深度限制问题，通过选择性采样中间状态实现了超越训练范围的推理时迭代能力，在多个实际应用领域展现出良好效果

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

TL;DR: 提出基于实例的自适应采样框架，用于构建紧凑且信息丰富的训练数据集，通过动态分配采样资源来显著提高样本效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习方法需要从先验分布中抽取大量训练样本，当先验分布维度高或需要高精度时，数据收集成本巨大

Method: 迭代式细化训练数据集，根据最新预测结果动态调整采样策略，使数据集适应每个测试实例周围逆映射的几何结构

Result: 在逆散射问题中验证了方法的有效性，在复杂先验或高精度要求下优势更加明显

Conclusion: 自适应采样策略具有广泛适用性，可扩展到其他逆问题，为传统固定数据集训练提供了可扩展的实用替代方案

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单任务学习方法无法充分利用任务间的互补性，计算资源消耗大，需要一种更高效的多任务学习框架来改善ADMET预测性能。

Method: 基于Chemprop-RDKit背景，采用量子化学描述符丰富分子表征，并提出新的指数任务权重方案，结合数据集规模先验知识和可学习参数实现动态损失平衡。

Conclusion: QW-MTL框架通过量子信息特征和适应性任务权重，证明了多任务分子学习在ADMET预测中的有效性和效率优势，为药物发现提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

Motivation: 现有代表性相似性指标缺乏系统性比较，需要量化评估它们在不同模型家族间的区分能力

Method: 使用dprime、轩路系数和ROC-AUC三种补充性区分度量，系统评估RSA、线性预测性、Procrustes和软匹配等常用指标的区分能力

Conclusion: 提供了第一个通过区分能力视角系统比较相似性指标的研究，为大规模模型和脑比较选择指标提供指导

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将分体保形预测扩展到函数空间的方法，为神经算子提供有限样本覆盖保证，解决了无限维设置中的不确定性量化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经算子在无限维设置中的不确定性量化是一个开放问题，现有方法（高斯过程、贝叶斯神经网络等）需要强分布假设或产生保守覆盖，缺乏对函数值输出的有限样本覆盖保证。

Method: 采用两步法：首先在有限维空间通过输出函数空间的离散化映射建立有限样本覆盖保证，然后通过考虑离散化细化时的渐近收敛将这些保证提升到函数空间。提出了基于回归的校正来跨分辨率传输校准，并提出了两个诊断指标。

Result: 经验结果表明，该方法在分辨率变化下保持校准覆盖且变化较小，在超分辨率任务中实现了更好的覆盖。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将分体保形预测扩展到函数空间，为神经算子提供了有效的有限样本不确定性量化框架，解决了函数值输出的覆盖保证问题。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

Motivation: 研究转导式共形预测中同时预测多个数据点时置信度与效率（预测集大小）之间的基本关系，揭示其内在的权衡限制。

Method: 推导严格的有限样本界限，分析预测集大小随样本数量和条件熵的指数增长关系，包含分散度二阶项，并在理想化设置中证明界限的可达性。

Result: 发现任何非平凡置信水平都会导致预测集大小呈指数增长，指数与样本数量线性相关且与条件熵成正比，分散度作为二阶项影响界限紧密度。

Conclusion: 转导式共形预测存在置信度-效率的根本权衡，预测集大小必然随不确定性指数增长，这一界限在理论上是最优的且在实际设置中可达。

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

Result: 发现transformer中表征的演化可以解释为恢复分类最优特征的运动轨迹

Conclusion: 注意力机制可以理解为在多项式回归框架下寻找最优特征的过程，这为理解transformer内部机制提供了新的理论视角

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

TL;DR: 在差分隐私模型下研究满足Tsybakov噪声条件的随机凸优化问题，提出了不依赖Lipschitz常数的算法，并证明了上下界的匹配性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分隐私凸优化研究假设损失函数满足Lipschitz连续性，但实际问题中Lipschitz常数可能极大或无界。本文考虑更一般的Tsybakov噪声条件，充分利用梯度的矩条件来改进算法性能

Method: 首先在Lipschitz情况下(θ≥2)提出(ε,δ)-DP算法，然后扩展到θ≥θ̅>1的更一般情况。当隐私预算ε较小时，甚至可以处理非Lipschitz的损失函数。同时证明了下界，表明算法的最优性

Result: 获得了不依赖Lipschitz常数的上界赋界：Σ̃O((r̃₂ᵋ(1/√n + √d/nε)^(k-1)/k)^(θ/(θ-1)))，以及匹配的下界Ω((r̃ᵋ(1/√n + √d/n√ρ)^(k-1)/k)^(θ/(θ-1)))，其中r̃ᵋ为梯度的k阶矩

Conclusion: 该研究在差分隐私凸优化中重要的进展，通过利用梯度的矩条件替代传统的Lipschitz假设，提供了更一般化且最优的算法设计，为处理复杂实际问题中的非Lipschitz损失函数提供了理论基础

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

### [69] [Echoes Before Collapse: Deep Learning Detection of Flickering in Complex Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04683)
*Yazdan Babazadeh Maghsoodlo,Madhur Anand,Chris T. Bauch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 深度学习可以准确识别复杂系统中的闪烁现象（噪声驱动的状态切换），这是系统韧性降低的早期预警信号，在气候、生态、金融等领域具有重要应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闪烁现象是复杂系统（如气候系统、生态系统、金融市场）韧性降低的标志性特征，可能预示着难以预测的关键状态转变。虽然深度学习在预测临界点方面表现出强大能力，但其在检测闪烁现象方面的潜力尚未被探索。

Method: 使用卷积长短期记忆（CNN LSTM）模型，在由简单多项式函数加噪声生成的合成时间序列上进行训练。

Result: 模型能够准确识别闪烁模式，尽管基于简化动力学训练，但能泛化到各种随机系统，并在经验数据（如睡鼠体温记录和非洲湿润期古气候代用指标）中可靠检测到闪烁现象。

Conclusion: 深度学习能够从噪声非线性时间序列中提取早期预警信号，为识别广泛动力系统中的不稳定性提供了一个灵活框架。

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

*Farnoosh Hashemi,Laks V. S. Lakshmanan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为KRAFT的学习型地图融合方法，通过知识图谱构建、地图匹配和地图合并三个模块，解决了传统方法只能处理线性对象和基于启发式规则的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地图融合方法存在两个主要限制：只能处理线性对象（如道路网络），无法扩展到非线性对象；基于预定义规则的启发式算法，无法以数据驱动方式学习实体匹配。数字地图的准确性和时效性要求及时更新，但地理空间数据库存在区域限制和实体缺失问题。

Method: KRAFT包含三个部分：1）知识图谱构建 - 将每个地理空间数据库表示为知识图谱；2）地图匹配 - 使用知识图谱对齐方法和地理空间特征编码器匹配实体；3）地图合并 - 使用混合整数线性规划公式一致地合并匹配的实体，确保完全融合而不产生不一致性。

Result: 实验评估显示，KRAFT在地图融合任务中不仅相比最先进方法和基线方法表现出色，而且其各个模块（如地图匹配和地图合并）也分别优于传统的匹配和合并方法。

Conclusion: KRAFT通过学习型方法有效解决了地图融合中的关键问题，能够处理非线性对象并以数据驱动方式进行实体匹配，为地理空间数据库的更新和增强提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CPEP框架，通过对比学习对齐EMG和姿态表示，提升弱模态数据的表示质量，实现零样本手势分类


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用低成本生物信号（如表面肌电信号sEMG）实现连续手势预测，但弱模态数据表示质量有限，需要通过与高质量结构化数据对齐来提升性能

Method: 提出对比姿态-EMG预训练（CPEP）框架，学习能够产生高质量且包含姿态信息的EMG编码器，通过线性探测和零样本设置评估性能

Result: 在分布内手势分类上比emg2pose基准模型提升21%，在未见（分布外）手势分类上提升72%

Conclusion: 通过学习弱模态数据与高质量结构化数据的对齐表示，可以显著提升手势分类性能，特别是在零样本场景下

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

### [72] [Natural Spectral Fusion: p-Exponent Cyclic Scheduling and Early Decision-Boundary Alignment in First-Order Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04713)
*Gongyue Zhang,Honghai Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了自然频谱融合(NSF)方法，将优化器视为频谱控制器，通过p指数扩展和循环调度动态平衡高低频信息，改善频谱覆盖和跨频带融合，在多个基准测试中显著降低测试误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究广泛讨论了机器学习中的频谱行为，但优化器自身的频谱偏好仍不清楚。作者认为一阶优化器表现出内在的频率偏好，显著重塑优化路径。

Method: 提出自然频谱融合(NSF)：将训练重新定义为可控频谱覆盖和信息融合，而非仅仅调整步长。通过p指数扩展二阶矩项（支持正负指数）和循环调度实现，周期性重新加权频带而不改变模型、数据或训练流程。

Result: 理论和实验表明：自适应方法强调低频，SGD接近中性，负指数放大高频信息。循环调度拓宽频谱覆盖，改善跨频带融合，诱导早期决策边界对齐（即使损失仍高时准确率已提升）。在相同学习率策略和固定超参数下，p指数循环调度持续降低测试误差，在某些任务上仅用1/4训练成本即可达到基线准确率。

Conclusion: NSF揭示了优化器作为主动频谱控制器的作用，为一阶优化提供了统一、可控且高效的框架。

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

*Yuzhu Chen,Yingjie Wang,Shunyu Liu,Yongcheng Jing,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoVeR是一种基于共形预测框架的无模型解码策略，能够在保持紧凑搜索空间的同时确保对期望轨迹的高覆盖概率，提供理论保证的覆盖率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归预训练模型解码策略（如beam search）缺乏可证明的覆盖保证，难以平衡搜索效率与多样化轨迹需求，特别是在需要长尾序列的实际应用中。

Method: 提出CoVeR方法，在共形预测框架内设计模型无关的解码策略，通过理论分析建立PAC风格的泛化边界。

Result: 理论证明CoVeR能够渐近地实现至少1-α的覆盖率，其中α∈(0,1)是任意目标水平。

Conclusion: CoVeR为复杂推理任务提供了一种具有理论覆盖率保证的高效解码方案，解决了现有方法在覆盖保证和搜索效率平衡方面的局限性。

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

*Jasmine Shone,Shaden Alshammari,Mark Hamilton,Zhening Li,William Freeman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beyond I-Con框架通过探索不同的统计散度和相似性核函数，系统性地发现新的损失函数，在无监督聚类、监督对比学习和降维任务中均取得了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I-Con框架揭示了23种表示学习方法隐含地最小化数据分布与学习分布之间的KL散度，但KL散度的不对称性和无界性可能导致优化问题，且可能与真实目标不一致。

Method: 提出Beyond I-Con框架，探索替代统计散度（如总变差距离、有界f-散度）和相似性核函数（如距离核替代角度核），系统性地发现新的损失函数。

Result: 1) 在DINO-ViT嵌入的无监督聚类中，使用总变差距离改进PMI算法达到SOTA结果；2) 在监督对比学习中，使用总变差距离和距离核优于标准方法；3) 在降维任务中，使用有界f-散度替代KL散度获得更好的定性结果和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 统计散度和相似性核函数的选择对表示学习优化至关重要，Beyond I-Con框架为系统探索这些选择提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

TL;DR: VARMAformer结合了交叉注意力机制和经典VARMA统计模型，通过VARMA特征提取器和增强注意力机制，在时间序列预测中实现了更好的全局和局部依赖建模，显著超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的仅交叉注意力Transformer模型（如CATS）虽然高效，但忽略了经典统计模型（如VARMA）能够捕捉的细粒度局部时间依赖性，需要将经典统计洞察融入现代深度学习框架。

Method: 提出VARMAformer架构：1）VARMA特征提取器（VFE）在patch级别显式建模自回归和移动平均模式；2）VARMA增强注意力机制（VE-atten）使用时序门使查询更具上下文感知能力。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上的实验表明，该模型始终优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 将经典统计洞察融入现代深度学习框架对时间序列预测有显著益处，验证了这种融合方法的有效性。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Motivation: 随着隐私攻击和敏感信息泄漏风险的增加，需要有效移除图神经网络模型中的敏感训练数据。现有的节点删除方法要么限制GNN结构，要么没有有效利用图拓扑特征，甚至会破坏图拓扑，影响性能-复杂度平衡。

Method: 提出三种新的节点删除方法：1)基于类别的标签替换；2)拓扑导向的邻居平均后验概率；3)类一致的邻居节点过滤。后两种方法特别重点利用了图的拓扑特征。

Result: 在三个标准数据集上进行实验，从模型效用、删除效用和删除效率三个指标评估。实验结果表明所提方法在效用和效率方面都优于现有的最先进节点删除方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够高效移除敏感训练节点并保护敏感节点的隐私信息，为提升GNN模型的隐私安全性做出了贡献，并为节点删除领域提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

Conclusion: 提出了一个受人类大脑启发的框架，使强化学习智能体能够持续学习，有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了多种深度学习模型在EEG信号眼睛闭合检测中的性能，发现CNN-RNN混合模型在健康人群中达到95.8%的最高准确率，在帕金森病患者中也达到75.8%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼睛闭合率及其变异性是监测认知负荷、注意力和神经疾病的重要生理标记物，需要准确的检测方法来区分EEG信号中的自主眼睛闭合和非眼睛闭合信号。

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

TL;DR: 提出使用双随机归一化方法来分解混淆矩阵中的类别相似性和分布偏差因素，从而更准确地诊断模型行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混淆矩阵的值同时受到类别相似性和分布偏差的影响，难以区分两者的独立贡献，需要一种方法来解耦这些误差源

Method: 引入基于迭代比例拟合的双随机归一化方法，这是一种行和列归一化的泛化，能够恢复类别相似性的底层结构

Result: 该方法能够分离误差源，支持更有针对性的模型改进，并在模型的内部类别表示空间中提供几何解释

Conclusion: 双随机归一化为混淆矩阵分析提供了新的视角，能够更深入地理解分类器的行为，并为模型诊断和改进提供更精确的工具

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

TL;DR: NeuSA是一种基于谱方法启发的PINN新架构，通过谱基投影和神经ODE结合，解决了传统PINN在复杂初值问题中的收敛困难、因果性违反和频谱偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于MLP的PINN在处理复杂初值问题时经常无法收敛，导致解违反因果性且存在对低频成分的频谱偏差，需要新的架构来解决这些问题。

Method: NeuSA学习PDE在谱基上的投影，获得动力学的有限维表示，然后与适应的神经ODE集成，利用谱表示的高频成分克服频谱偏差，继承NODE的因果结构，并基于经典方法的初始化方案在目标解附近开始训练。

Result: 在线性和非线性波动方程的基准测试中，NeuSA相比其他架构表现出更强的性能，具有更快的收敛速度、改进的时间一致性和更优的预测精度。

Conclusion: NeuSA通过结合谱方法和神经ODE，成功解决了PINN的关键挑战，为复杂PDE求解提供了有效的神经网络框架。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当测试数据遇到混合分布偏移、小批量大小或在线不平衡标签分布偏移时，现有的TTA方法可能失效或甚至对模型性能造成负面影响，这是阻碍TTA方法在实际部署中遇到的主要问题。

Method: 首先分析发现批处理层是影响TTA稳定性的关键因素，使用批无关的归一化层(如组归一化或层归一化)可以提高稳定性。提出了SAR方法：1)移除具有大梯度的噪声样本 2)鼓励模型权重进入平坦最小值。在SAR基础上提出SAR^2方法：1)使用冗余正则化器减少特征间相关性 2)使用不公平正则化器最大化原型质心的预测告性来减少偏见。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的SAR和SAR^2方法在各种野外测试场景下都能比现有方法更稳定地运行，并且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 论文通过分析TTA失效的根本原因，提出了一套有效的解决方案，能够在复杂的实际测试环境中提高模型的稳定性和性能，为TTA方法的实际部署提供了重要支撑。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising
variants for screening to increase their quality and reduce the amount of
necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

Motivation: 现有的初始化方法如Glorot、He、正交矩阵等方法中，部分方法没有考虑网络深度信息，而在深度网络中保持流入流出方差为1的理论假设并不能达到最佳效果。

Method: 提出了一种新的初始化方法，结合每个层的深度位置以及整个网络的深度信息，通过灵活的方式逐层增加网络激活值的方差。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的方法在深度网络中表现更优于现有的初始化方案。

Conclusion: 对于深度神经网络，需要从第一层到最后一层逐渐增加激活值方差，而不是绝对保持单位方差，提出的方法能够有效提高深度网络的训练效果。

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to
showcase the practical relevance of our findings.

Motivation: 解决传统物理信息神经网络(PINNs)需要针对每个PDE问题单独训练的问题，开发一个能够零样本泛化到各类参数化PDE的统一框架。

Method: 结合Swin Transformer超网络和混合监督：使用MMS生成的解析解作为标签数据，以及物理信息目标优化的无标签样本。模型将PDE参数映射到目标PINNs，并引入迭代精化过程生成集成解。

Conclusion: HyPINO展示了作为扩展神经算子解决复杂非线性高维PDE问题的基础潜力，具有显著提高的精度和降低的计算成本。

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

Result: 细粒度标签训练并不总是能提高分类准确率，其有效性关键取决于数据的几何结构及其与标签层次的关系

Conclusion: 细粒度标签训练策略的效果具有条件性，需要根据具体的数据特征和模型条件来评估是否采用该策略

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM中KV缓存大小随上下文长度和模型深度线性增长，成为长上下文推理的主要瓶颈，现有压缩方法或固化或打破缓存结构或需专门计算内核。

Method: 使用注意力评估token重要性，独立选择每个注意头的关键token，将其对齐到统一的复合token结构中，并通过全局分配机制适配各层的保留预算。

Result: 实现了显著的内存减少，同时保持了准确性，一致超过之前的结构化和半结构化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，完全兼容标准推理流程，为高效长上下文LLM部署提供了实用可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量化的一维CNN模型，通过结构化剪枝技术，在保持高准确性的同时大幅减少模型计算资源需求，适用于资源有限环境下的EEG狂狂检测。


<details>

Result: 基线模型达到92.78%准确率和0.8686宏观F1分数。剪枝后模型在权重和内存减少50%的情况下，准确率提升至92.87%，宏观F1分数提升至0.8707，保持了预测能力。

Conclusion: 结构化剪枝能够有效移除模型冗余，改善模型的普适性能力。结合轻度早停正则化，为提高狂狂检测的效率和可靠性提供了有前晨的方案，特别适用于资源有限的环境。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了强化学习中后继度量具有低秩结构的假设，发现移位后继度量才具有低秩特性，并提供了有限样本性能保证和新的马尔可夫链函数不等式分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代强化学习算法通常假设后继度量具有低秩结构，但作者发现这种假设存在问题，需要重新审视低秩结构在强化学习中的适用性。

Method: 提出移位后继度量的概念，证明其具有低秩特性；开发基于采样条目的低秩近似估计方法；建立Type II Poincaré不等式来分析谱可恢复性；通过实验验证理论发现。

Result: 证明了移位后继度量确实具有低秩结构，所需移位量通常很小；建立了移位量与动力系统局部混合性质的联系；实验显示移位后继度量能提升目标条件强化学习的性能。

Conclusion: 移位操作是获得有效低秩近似的关键，Type II Poincaré不等式为分析提供了新工具，该方法在实践中有良好应用前景。

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based
approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead
remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training
framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient
cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales
and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to
3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while
cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further
demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing
units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over
the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

Abstract: This work addresses the key challenges of applying federated learning to
large-scale deep neural networks, particularly the issue of client drift due to
data heterogeneity across clients and the high costs of communication,
computation, and memory. We propose FedSub, an efficient subspace algorithm for
federated learning on heterogeneous data. Specifically, FedSub utilizes
subspace projection to guarantee local updates of each client within
low-dimensional subspaces, thereby reducing communication, computation, and
memory costs. Additionally, it incorporates low-dimensional dual variables to
mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on
convergence. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

Motivation: 为了开发能够预测胶排放和关键性能参数的深度学习模型，实现碳捕捉系统的实时监控、场景测试和操作优化，降低环境影响。

Method: 采用四种DL网络结构（基础LSTM、堆叠LSTM、双向LSTM、卷积LSTM），利用CESAR1润洗剂运行数据建立时间序列预测模型，并通过因果影响分析评估操作变量的影响。

Result: 模型预测准确度超过99%，能够有效跟踪稳态趋势和突变波动。因果分析显示调整稀润洗剂温度和水洗条件等参数可显著降低胶排放并改善系统性能。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了机器学习不仅是预测工具，还可作为决策支持系统优化碳捕捉操作，为实现智能化、数据驱动的控制策略提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AGC系统容易受到隐蔽的网络攻击（如FDIA），现有检测方法多为黑盒模型，缺乏可解释性，无法有效应对系统非线性特性。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)离线学习AGC测量值之间的复杂非线性关系，训练后提取符号公式来描述模型行为，提高可解释性。

Result: KAN模型在FDIA检测中达到95.97%的检测率，符号公式版本达到95.9%的检测率，且误报率低。

Conclusion: KAN为AGC系统提供了一种准确且可解释的FDIA检测方法，显著提升了电力系统网络安全防护能力。

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

Motivation: 深度强化学习的计算需求日益增长，但其能耗、温室气体排放和经济成本尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估算法的环境影响和经济效益。

Method: 使用Stable Baselines实现了7种SOTA DRL算法（DQN、TRPO、A2C、ARS、PPO、RecurrentPPO、QR-DQN），在10个Atari 2600游戏上各训练100万步，实时测量功耗以估算能耗、CO2排放和电力成本。

Conclusion: 研究为开发能源意识和成本效益的DRL实践提供了可行见解，为未来算法设计和评估中纳入可持续性考量奠定了基础。

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

Abstract: With a very rapid increase in deepfakes and digital image forgeries, ensuring
the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report
introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and
frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch
convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and
frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a
Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When
benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,
outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker
performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our
approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it
ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic
scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the
art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media
verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

Result: 在Pinterest广告推荐系统中进行在线A/B测试，与基准手动调整方法相比，DRL-PUT在处理段将点击率提高9.7%，长点击率提高7.7%

Conclusion: DRL-PUT框架能够有效解决广告推荐系统中的多目标优化问题，实现个性化调整和自适应性，显著提升了系统性能

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在建筑项目管理中的加速应用，需要批判性评估大型语言模型在伦理敏感、高风险决策环境中的伦理可行性和可靠性。

Method: 采用混合研究方法：定量测试两个领先LLMs在12个真实伦理场景中的表现（使用新的伦理决策支持评估清单EDSAC），以及定性分析12位行业专家的半结构化访谈。

Result: LLMs在法律合规等结构化领域表现良好，但在处理情境细微差别、确保问责制和提供透明推理方面存在显著缺陷。利益相关者对AI自主进行伦理判断持保留态度，强烈主张需要强有力的人类监督。

Conclusion: LLMs目前最适合作为决策支持工具而非自主伦理代理，需要人类在环监督。研究提出了可复制的EDSAC框架和可行建议。

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

TL;DR: Maestro是一个框架无关的LLM智能体整体优化器，通过联合搜索图结构和节点配置来最大化智能体质量，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器主要调整配置而固定图结构，无法解决结构性故障模式，需要一种能够同时优化图结构和节点配置的全面优化方法。

Method: 引入Maestro框架，联合搜索智能体的图结构（模块和信息流）和节点配置（模型、提示、工具等），利用反射性文本反馈来优先处理编辑，提高样本效率。

Result: 在IFBench和HotpotQA基准测试中，Maestro平均优于MIPROv2、GEPA和GEPA+Merge分别12%、4.9%和4.86%；即使在仅提示优化限制下，仍领先9.65%、2.37%和2.41%，且使用比GEPA更少的rollout。

Conclusion: 联合图结构和配置搜索能够解决单纯提示调优无法解决的结构性故障模式，在多个应用中显示出显著优势。

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个分步框架，通过混合方法设计识别不同健康利益相关者的解释需求，优化LLM生成定制化健康模拟解释，解决现有通用摘要无法满足多样化需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于代理的建模等仿真方法在健康决策中潜力巨大，但由于模型复杂性难以被利益相关者使用。LLM虽然能翻译模拟输出，但现有通用摘要无法满足临床医生、政策制定者、患者等不同群体的多样化信息需求和风格偏好。

Method: 采用混合方法设计：首先获取不同健康利益相关者的解释需求和风格偏好，然后通过可控属性调优等方法优化LLM生成定制化输出，最后通过综合指标评估以进一步改进定制化摘要生成。

Result: 提出了一个系统性框架来识别利益相关者需求并指导LLM生成定制化的健康模拟解释，填补了在理解利益相关者需要什么解释以及如何相应定制方面的根本性空白。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于充分发挥健康模拟模型的潜力，通过为不同利益相关者提供量身定制的解释，使复杂模型对最需要它们的利益相关者更加可访问和有用。

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

Motivation: 传统AI指标无法全面抓住模型的细微能力，需要通过人类评价标准提升模型行为的可解释性和应用性

Method: 基于Perception Test和OpenEQA指标，进行深度访谈和大规模调查，识别优先级设定、记忆、辨别和上下文化等关键认知技能

Result: 发现参与者认为AI缺乏解释性和共情能力，但对AI表现持有高期望，通过整合研究结果开发了更符合人类对齐的评测框架

Conclusion: 用户中心的评估对AI发展至关重要，本研究为定义和测量AI进步提供了可操作的指南，同时改善了当前指标并为未来AI模型评估奠定基础

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human
cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices
and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇位置论文建议通过分层脚手架和语言驱动的世界模型来解决多治理系统中的复杂任务挑战，利用大语言模型动态生成分层结构以提高学习效率和战略性行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能领域中，语言模型和治理模型得到了重点关注，但精细的明确世界模型发展仍是关键瓶颈，尤其在复杂长期限多治理任务中。标准强化学习在高保真度但结构平坦的模拟器中学习的治理常因探索空间过大和奖励稀疏而失败。

Method: 通过系统性审查2024年多治理足球研究，识别出将符号化和层次方法与多治理强化学习结合的趋势。提出使用大语言模型动态生成分层脚手架，利用语言在飞行中构建世界模型。构建具有明确、语言可配置任务层的环境。

Result: 语言驱动的世界模型提供了内在课程、浓密有意义的学习信号以及组合学习框架，使得治理模型能够以更高的样本效率获得精渐的战略性行为。

Conclusion: 通过构建具有明确、语言可配置任务层的环境，可以桥接低级反应式行为与高级战略团队配合之间的差距，为训练下一代智能治理创建一个强大且可通用的框架。

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WiA-LLM通过整合假设分析(WIA)和强化学习，赋予大语言模型主动思考能力，使其能够预测行动后果而非仅被动响应，在复杂游戏环境中实现了74.2%的状态变化预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型只能被动处理信息，缺乏系统性探索假设未来的能力，这限制了它们在动态高风险场景（如战略规划、风险评估和实时决策）中的应用价值。

Method: 提出WiA-LLM范式，整合假设分析(WIA)方法，通过强化学习利用环境反馈，动态模拟每个潜在行动的结果，使模型能够预测未来状态而非仅对当前条件做出反应。

Result: 在《王者荣耀》复杂多玩家游戏环境中验证，WiA-LLM在预测游戏状态变化方面达到74.2%的准确率（比基线提升两倍），在高难度场景中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 这是首个正式探索并将假设分析能力整合到大语言模型中的工作，代表了LLM主动推理能力的根本性进步，为动态环境中的稳健决策提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TalkToAgent是一个多代理大型语言模型框架，通过五个专业LLM代理提供交互式自然语言解释，弥合复杂强化学习策略与领域专家之间的理解鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释强化学习(XRL)方法存在解释结果可理解性有限、工具覆盖孤立的问题，导致用户不确定使用哪种工具，需要更透明、交互式的解释框架。

Method: 采用五代理LLM架构（协调器、解释器、编码器、评估器、调试器），自动将用户查询映射到相关XRL工具，提供关键状态变量、预期结果或反事实解释。

Result: 在四重水箱过程控制问题上验证，TalkToAgent成功高精度映射用户查询到XRL任务，编码器-调试器交互最小化反事实生成失败，定性评估确认有效解释代理行为。

Conclusion: TalkToAgent框架有效提升了RL策略的可解释性，通过多代理协作和自然语言交互，为领域专家提供了更直观、上下文相关的解释能力。

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统性地描述了语言模型智能体的长期合作行为特征，为未来研究复杂人机混合社交环境中语言模型的作用奠定了基础

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

Motivation: 自动化重复性任务、降低运营成本并提供继续支持，通过克隆优秀人员的对话模式来提升客服和医疗等领域的服务质量。

Method: 使用电话销售数据作为案例，通过领域选择、知识提取和prompt工程构建代理，整合语音识别、大语言模型对话管理和语音合成技术成为流式推理管道。

Result: 在包含介绍、产品沟通、销售驱动、异议处理和成交等22个标准的评估中，AI代理在常规通话方面接近人类表现，但在说服和异议处理方面较差。

Conclusion: 分析了系统的不足之处并对prompt进行了精炼，提出了设计经验和未来研究方向，包括大规模模拟和自动化评估。

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中专家智能体之间高效语言交互的瓶颈问题，现有工作在智能体选择和结果聚合方面有进展，但深度协作的交互效率仍是关键挑战。

Method: 提出OSC框架作为选择和聚合之间的中间层，引入协作知识模型(CKM)使智能体动态感知合作者认知状态，通过实时认知差距分析自适应调整通信行为。

Result: 在复杂推理和问题解决基准测试中，OSC显著提高了任务性能和通信效率，将"并行工作的个体"转变为"深度协作的认知团队"。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅优化了多智能体协作，还为LLM智能体交互行为提供了新的见解，解决了深度协作中的关键瓶颈问题。

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

TL;DR: SparkUI-Parser是一个新颖的端到端GUI解析框架，通过连续坐标建模和拒绝机制，显著提高了定位精度和推理速度，同时支持对整个界面的细粒度解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有MLLMs在GUI感知中的两个主要问题：1）基于文本自回归机制的离散坐标建模导致定位精度低和推理速度慢；2）只能定位预定义元素集合，无法解析整个界面，限制了广泛应用和下游任务支持。

Method: 基于预训练MLLM，增加token路由器和坐标解码器进行连续坐标建模，避免离散输出特性限制；引入基于改进匈牙利匹配算法的拒绝机制来识别和拒绝不存在的元素；构建ScreenParse基准测试集。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-v2、CAGUI-Grounding和ScreenParse等多个基准测试中 consistently outperforms SOTA方法，显著提升了准确性和推理速度。

Conclusion: SparkUI-Parser通过连续建模和拒绝机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了更高的定位精度、更快的推理速度和对整个界面的细粒度解析能力，为GUI模型的广泛应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at
https://github.com/antgroup/SparkUI-Parser.

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理的发展，需要一种机制来基于实际性能而非声明能力对代理进行排名，但当前缺乏全局透明的交互网络，使用信号分散且私有，无法有效排名。

Method: 提出DOVIS五层协议（发现、编排、验证、激励、语义）收集最小化隐私保护的使用和性能聚合数据，并实现AgentRank-UC算法，结合使用频率和能力指标（结果质量、成本、安全性、延迟）进行动态排名。

Result: 通过仿真实验和理论分析证明了协议的收敛性、鲁棒性和抗Sybil攻击能力，展示了协调协议和性能感知排名在构建可扩展可信代理网络中的可行性。

Conclusion: DOVIS协议和AgentRank-UC算法为构建机器原生的Web of Agents生态系统提供了可行的技术基础，通过隐私保护的方式实现了基于实际性能的代理排名。

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时扩展方法主要依赖冗余采样，忽视了历史经验的利用，限制了计算效率。为了解决这一局限性，需要开发能够有效利用历史尝试信息的方法。

Method: 提出Sticker-TTS框架，使用蒸馏的关键条件（称为sticker）来驱动关键信息的提取、精化和跨多轮推理的重用。采用两阶段优化策略，结合模仿学习和自我改进，实现渐进式精化。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试（AIME-24、AIME-25和OlymMATH）上的广泛评估表明，Sticker-TTS在可比较的推理预算下 consistently 超越了强基线方法，包括自一致性和先进的强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 结果突出了sticker引导的历史经验利用的有效性，为大型推理模型的测试时扩展提供了更高效的方法。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are

Abstract: Innovators often exhibit cognitive fixation on existing solutions or nascent
ideas, hindering the exploration of novel alternatives. This paper introduces a
methodology for constructing Functional Concept Graphs (FCGs), interconnected
representations of functional elements that support abstraction, problem
reframing, and analogical inspiration. Our approach yields large-scale,
high-quality FCGs with explicit abstraction relations, overcoming limitations
of prior work. We further present MUSE, an algorithm leveraging FCGs to
generate creative inspirations for a given problem. We demonstrate our method
by computing an FCG on 500K patents, which we release for further research.

TL;DR: ProToM是一个基于心理理论的AI系统，通过贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标并提供针对性反馈，在多智能体环境中有效促进亲社会行为，相比现有大语言模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中智能体在追求独立目标时难以确定何时以及如何协助他人的挑战，促进亲社会行为（即使与自身目标不完全一致但有益他人的行动）。

Method: 提出ProToM系统：1）使用贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标；2）基于推断的目标分布，通过最大化期望效用来选择上下文敏感的反馈信息。

Result: 在Doors、Keys和Gems以及Overcooked两个多智能体环境中测试，ProToM相比基线方法：获得更高的成功率、更短的任务完成时间，且更受人类用户青睐。现有大语言和推理模型在提供及时且上下文相关的反馈方面存在不足。

Conclusion: ProToM能够提供有针对性和有用的反馈，有效促进多智能体系统中的亲社会行为，优于当前最先进的大语言模型方法。

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 为ODRL语言提供基于查询答复的正式语义学，并定义政策比较问题用于检测等价、更限制或更允许的政策


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ODRL已成为数字资源访问和使用管理的实际标准，但缺乏全面的正式语义学定义，影响政策评估和比较

Method: 提出基于查询答复的简单直观正式语义学，精炼之前的形式化方法，并与ODRL 2.2规范保持一致

Result: 建立了一套完整的ODRL正式语义学框架，能够支持政策评估和比较

Conclusion: 该研究为ODRL提供了坚实的理论基础，特别是在数据共享场景中，为政策比较和管理提供了重要的技术支撑

Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies
in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto
standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although
preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the
language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.
In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo
