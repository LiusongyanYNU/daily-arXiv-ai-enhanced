### [1] [Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation via Multiple Foundation Models Mapper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04957)
*Gehui Chen,Guan'an Wang,Xiaowen Huang,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper是一个高效的多基础模型映射器，通过融合双视觉编码器特征和使用GPT-2替代线性映射器，在视频到音频生成任务中实现了更好的语义和时间一致性，且训练效率显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法需要从头训练模型，资源消耗大。虽然已有工作探索使用预训练基础模型，但仍有改进空间，特别是在特征丰富性和映射效率方面。

Method: 提出MFM-Mapper方法：1）使用双视觉编码器融合更丰富的语义和时间特征；2）用GPT-2替代线性映射器，将跨模态特征映射视为自回归翻译任务；3）保持轻量级设计，仅需训练映射网络。

Result: MFM-Mapper在训练效率方面表现突出，仅需先前映射器方法16%的训练规模即可达到竞争性性能。在语义和时间一致性方面优于先前方法，且与更大规模训练的模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 通过融合多基础模型特征和改进映射架构，MFM-Mapper实现了高效且高性能的视频到音频生成，为跨模态生成任务提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

### [2] [Facial Emotion Recognition does not detect feeling unsafe in automated driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04490)
*Abel van Elburg,Konstantinos Gkentsidis,Mathieu Sarrazin,Sarah Barendswaard,Varun Kotian,Riender Happee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过驾驶模拟器实验研究自动驾驶风格和行人交互对乘客风险感知的影响，并开发了基于车辆运动和皮电导的神经网络风险预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自动驾驶车辆的公众接受度，重点关注信任和感知安全性在风险感知中的作用。

Method: 使用32名参与者进行驾驶模拟器实验，测量主观舒适度、运动、面部表情、皮电导、心率和眼动跟踪。比较两种自动驾驶风格和是否有跨越行人的影响。

Result: 动态驾驶风格导致更强的不舒适感，跨越行人使动态驾驶时的不舒适感增加一倍。面部表情识别在风险评估中不可靠，而基于车辆运动和皮电导的神经网络模型能够有效预测感知风险。

Conclusion: 自动驾驶风格和临界事件的后果对风险感知有重要影响，面部表情识别不适合用于风险评估，而物理生理信号的对象化模型为自动驾驶风险评估提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [3] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer是一个新颖的通用提示词重写框架，通过强化学习训练Chain-of-Thought重写器，显著提升文本到图像生成模型的对齐性能，无需修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂用户提示时存在属性绑定、否定和组合关系等方面的困难，导致用户意图与生成结果之间存在显著不匹配。

Method: 提出PromptEnhancer框架，通过强化学习训练Chain-of-Thought重写器，使用专门的AlignEvaluator奖励模型提供细粒度反馈，该奖励模型基于24个关键点的系统分类法。

Result: 在HunyuanImage 2.1模型上的广泛实验表明，PromptEnhancer在广泛的语义和组合挑战中显著改善了图像-文本对齐性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成更精确被T2I模型解释的提示词，并引入了新的高质量人类偏好基准来促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

### [4] [Skywork UniPic 2.0: Building Kontext Model with Online RL for Unified Multimodal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04548)
*Hongyang Wei,Baixin Xu,Hongbo Liu,Cyrus Wu,Jie Liu,Yi Peng,Peiyu Wang,Zexiang Liu,Jingwen He,Yidan Xietian,Chuanxin Tang,Zidong Wang,Yichen Wei,Liang Hu,Boyi Jiang,William Li,Ying He,Yang Liu,Xuchen Song,Eric Li,Yahui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext是一个2B参数的DiT模型，通过架构改进和大规模预训练，结合创新的渐进式双任务强化策略，在图像生成和编辑任务上超越了更大参数量的模型，并扩展为统一的多模态框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源多模态模型过于注重参数规模扩展而忽视训练策略优化，限制了效率和性能。需要开发更高效的训练方法来提升模型能力。

Method: 基于SD3.5-Medium进行架构修改和大规模高质量数据预训练，提出渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)分阶段增强指令跟随和编辑一致性，最后通过连接器与Qwen2.5-VL-7B联合训练构建统一多模态模型。

Result: 模型在图像生成和编辑能力上超越了BAGEL(7B)和Flux-Kontext(12B)等更大参数模型，UniPic2-Metaquery在多任务上达到顶级性能。

Conclusion: 提出的训练范式Skywork UniPic 2.0被证明是有效且可推广的，能够以简单可扩展的方式实现理解、生成和编辑的统一集成。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [5] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag是一个基于像素空间双向变形和图像修复的拖拽式图像编辑框架，实现了实时变形预览和高效修复，显著提升了交互体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的拖拽式图像编辑方法主要依赖于生成模型的潜在空间操作，导致精度有限、反馈延迟和模型特定约束，需要更直接高效的解决方案。

Method: 将拖拽编辑分解为像素空间双向变形和图像修复，将图像区域视为可变形材料，通过弹性物体变形原理实现自然形状保持。

Result: 在512x512分辨率下实现实时变形预览(0.01秒)和高效修复(0.3秒)，相比现有方法需要数分钟每次编辑，显著提升了交互体验。

Conclusion: 该方法作为通用适配器，无需修改架构即可与任何修复模型配合使用，自动继承修复技术的未来改进，在视觉质量和精确控制方面表现优异，同时保持实时性能。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [6] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH是首个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，采用"再生与修正"策略，通过扩散模型生成整个图像来消除对抗补丁攻击，无需先验知识即可应对各种攻击类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的物体检测器仍然容易受到对抗补丁攻击，这些攻击可以隐藏真实物体或创建虚假物体，造成严重后果。现有防御方法缺乏通用性和对自适应攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 利用扩散模型的分布内生成能力重新生成整个图像，然后通过修正过程识别并替换对抗区域为重新生成的良性对应部分。该方法与攻击无关，不需要现有补丁的先验知识。

Result: 在多个检测器和攻击上的实验表明，DISPATCH在隐藏攻击和创建攻击上都优于最先进的防御方法，在隐藏攻击上达到89.3%的mAP.5分数，在无目标创建攻击上将攻击成功率降低到24.8%。

Conclusion: DISPATCH对自适应攻击保持强鲁棒性，是物体检测系统实用可靠的防御方案，为对抗补丁攻击提供了有效的通用防御框架。

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

### [7] [WATCH: World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04600)
*Qijun Ying,Zhongyuan Hu,Rui Zhang,Ronghui Li,Yu Lu,Zijiao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH是一个统一的框架，通过角度分解和轨迹整合机制，解决了单目视频中全局人体运动重建的深度模糊和相机-人体运动耦合问题，在轨迹重建方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单目视频进行全局人体运动重建时的深度模糊、运动模糊以及相机与人体运动耦合等挑战，现有方法在相机方向信息利用和相机平移线索整合方面存在不足。

Method: 提出WATCH框架，包含分析性航向角分解技术和受世界模型启发的相机轨迹整合机制，能够高效利用相机方向信息并有效整合相机平移信息。

Result: 在野外基准测试中，WATCH在端到端轨迹重建方面实现了最先进的性能，证明了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决相机平移整合这一长期挑战提供了新见解，展示了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性，代码将公开可用。

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

### [8] [Sali4Vid: Saliency-Aware Video Reweighting and Adaptive Caption Retrieval for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04602)
*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid是一个显著性感知的密集视频字幕框架，通过视频重加权和自适应字幕检索来解决现有方法的时间戳监督不足和场景转换忽略问题，在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上达到SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端密集视频字幕方法存在两个主要问题：(1)仅对文本应用时间戳监督，将所有视频帧同等对待；(2)从固定大小的视频块中检索字幕，忽略了场景转换。

Method: 提出Sali4Vid框架，包含两个核心组件：1)显著性感知视频重加权 - 将时间戳标注转换为基于sigmoid的帧重要性权重；2)基于语义的自适应字幕检索 - 通过帧相似性分割视频以捕捉场景转换并改进字幕检索。

Result: 在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了联合改进视频加权和检索对密集视频字幕的益处。

Conclusion: Sali4Vid通过显著性感知的视频重加权和语义驱动的自适应检索，有效解决了现有密集视频字幕方法的局限性，为视频理解和字幕生成提供了更精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Conclusion: 该系统具有可扩展性、准确性和实用性，可作为新一代智慧城市中执法感知、基础设施独立的交通监控解决方案

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

### [10] [VCMamba: Bridging Convolutions with Multi-Directional Mamba for Efficient Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04669)
*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba是一种新颖的视觉骨干网络，通过结合CNN的局部特征提取能力和多向Mamba SSM的全局建模能力，在ImageNet和ADE20K任务上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs和SSMs在全局上下文建模方面表现出色，但缺乏CNN对细粒度局部特征的有效捕捉能力；而CNN虽然擅长局部特征提取，但缺乏全局推理能力。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 采用卷积主干和分层结构，早期阶段使用卷积块提取丰富的局部特征，后期阶段使用多向Mamba块来高效建模长距离依赖和全局上下文，保持线性复杂度。

Result: VCMamba-B在ImageNet-1K上达到82.6% top-1准确率，比PlainMamba-L3高0.3%且参数减少37%；在ADE20K上获得47.1 mIoU，比EfficientFormer-L7高2.0 mIoU且参数减少62%。

Conclusion: VCMamba成功整合了CNN和Mamba SSM的优势，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了卓越的特征表示能力，为视觉任务提供了高效的混合架构解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at
https://github.com/Wertyuui345/VCMamba.

*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体训练免费框架，通过Worker-Supervisor迭代架构解决语义分割中复杂文本标注指南遵循问题，无需任务特定重训练即可生成符合指南的分割掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中的语义分割不仅需要准确的分割掩码，还必须严格遵守复杂的文本标注指南。传统方法依赖昂贵的任务特定重训练，而现有开放词汇分割方法在处理段落级复杂指南时表现不佳。

Method: 采用多智能体训练免费框架，包含Worker执行分割、Supervisor根据检索到的指南进行批判、轻量级强化学习停止策略决定循环终止的迭代Worker-Supervisor精炼架构。

Result: 在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上评估，该方法显著优于最先进的基线方法，展现出强大的泛化能力和指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决复杂标注指南的遵循问题，在保证分割质量的同时平衡计算资源使用，为语义分割的实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

### [12] [Domain Adaptation for Different Sensor Configurations in 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04711)
*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文解决不同感器配置之间的域差问题，提出了下游微调和部分层微调两种技术，在多感器配置上实现更好的3D物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同车辆平台配置不同的感器导致点云分布差异，使得在一种配置上训练的模型在其他配置上性能下降，而现有研究对此域差问题关注不够。

Method: 提出两种技术：1)下游微调（多数据集训练后进行数据集特定微调）；2)部分层微调（仅更新部分层来改善跨配置泛化能力）。使用同一地理区域收集的多感器配置配对数据集进行验证。

Result: 联合训练配合下游微调和部分层微调方法，在每种感器配置上都持续超越了简单的联合训练方法。

Conclusion: 为3D物体检测模型适应多样化车辆平台提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

Conclusion: CD-Mamba能同时处理像素级细节和片段级长程依赖，在云盒检测任务中表现优异于现有方法

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出Task Consistency Training (TCT)框架解决医学图像分割中的类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型，通过一致性约束和过滤策略有效利用未标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中获取所有类别的完整标注耗时费力，部分标注数据集存在严重的类别不平衡问题，现有方法需要额外模型且容易受到标签噪声影响。

Method: TCT框架包含主分割头和多个辅助任务头，通过一致性约束利用未标注解剖结构，采用过滤策略排除低一致性噪声数据，并使用统一辅助不确定性加权损失防止特定任务主导。

Result: 在8个腹部数据集上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: TCT框架能够有效解决类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型，在多样化临床数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对SAM和SAM2在恶劣天气条件下分割性能下降的问题，提出了两种不确定性感知方法来提升自动驾驶场景的分割鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM和SAM2）在视觉模糊性高的恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，缺乏不确定性量化能力，而自动驾驶等安全关键应用需要更高的可靠性。

Method: 1. 为SAM2设计多步微调程序，将不确定性指标直接融入损失函数；2. 将医学影像中的不确定性感知适配器（UAT）适配到驾驶场景中。

Result: 在CamVid、BDD100K和GTA驾驶数据集上的实验表明，UAT-SAM在极端天气下优于标准SAM，而带有不确定性感知损失的SAM2在多样化驾驶场景中实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: 显式的不确定性建模对于在挑战性环境中进行安全关键自动驾驶具有重要价值，该方法显著提升了分割模型在恶劣天气条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

Abstract: Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity

environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based
HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component
of the pipeline, WatchHAR achieves compounding performance gains. We introduce
a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while
maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal
activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition,
realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

TL;DR: MCANet是一个多标签分类框架，通过多尺度特征学习和类别特定的注意力机制，显著提升了飓风后无人机图像损伤评估的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN方法难以捕捉多尺度空间特征，且无法有效区分视觉相似或共现的损伤类型，这限制了飓风后快速准确损伤评估的能力。

Method: 提出MCANet框架：1）使用Res2Net分层骨干网络丰富多尺度空间上下文；2）采用多头类别特定残差注意力模块，每个注意力分支关注不同空间粒度；3）结合局部细节与全局上下文信息。

Result: 在RescueNet数据集（4,494张飓风后无人机图像）上，MCANet达到91.75%的mAP，优于多个基准模型。使用8个注意力头时性能进一步提升至92.35%，对Road Blocked等困难类别的AP提升超过6%。

Conclusion: MCANet能够准确定位损伤相关区域，支持可解释性，其输出可用于灾后风险制图、应急路由和数字孪生灾害响应。未来可整合灾害知识图谱和多模态大语言模型提升适应性。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设视频中人群不变化，无法处理动态变化的群体。需要同时考虑局部外观特征和全局场景上下文，并确保时间上的一致性。

Method: 使用组检测增强的Vision-Language Model(VLM)提取每帧的局部和全局特征，通过图论对所有帧的组概率进行全局优化，检测动态变化的人群结构。

Result: 在公开数据集上表现超过现有最优方法，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过VLM特征提取和全局优化，能够有效检测视频中动态变化的人群，为复杂场景中的人群检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

TL;DR: FloodVision是一个零样本洪水深度估计框架，结合GPT-4o的视觉语言能力和结构化知识图谱，通过识别参考物体、检索真实高度、估计淹没比例来准确计算洪水深度，在110张图像上达到8.17厘米的平均绝对误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计算机视觉洪水检测方法存在精度限制和泛化能力差的问题，依赖固定物体检测器和任务特定训练，需要开发能够跨不同洪水场景准确估计深度的通用方法。

Method: 结合基础视觉语言模型GPT-4o的语义推理能力和结构化领域知识图谱，动态识别RGB图像中的参考物体，从知识图谱检索验证高度以减少幻觉，估计淹没比例并应用统计异常值过滤计算最终深度值。

Result: 在MyCoast New York的110张众包图像上评估，平均绝对误差为8.17厘米，比GPT-4o基线(10.28厘米)降低20.5%，优于先前基于CNN的方法，在不同场景中泛化良好且接近实时运行。

Conclusion: FloodVision框架适合未来集成到数字孪生平台和公民报告应用中，为智慧城市洪水韧性提供有效的深度估计解决方案。

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的混合塔框架PIG，通过伪查询生成和细粒度交互，同时实现了文本到视频检索的高效率和高效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP基础方法中双塔框架效果低和单塔框架效率低的问题，尝试统一两者优势。

Method: 设计了伪查询生成器，为每个视频生成伪查询，允许视频特征与文本特征在细粒度上交互，类似单塔框架的高效果，同时推理阶段无额外开销。

Result: 在5个标准数据集上表现优异，R@1指标提升1.6%~3.9%，效果接近state-of-the-art，效率与双塔框架相当。

Conclusion: 混合塔框架PIG成功统一了效果和效率的优势，为文本-视频检索领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Motivation: 针对医学MRI图像在切片维度空间分辨率低的问题，需要开发高效的超分辨率方法来提升图像质量，同时保持解剖细节和纹理信息。

Method: 结合多层感知机混合器(MLP-Mixers)和卷积层构建单维度SRGAN架构，使用MSSEG2数据集的高分辨率FLAIR MRI进行训练验证，并提出了新的无参考图像质量评估指标。

Result: 在三个多中心FLAIR数据集上测试显示，MLP-SRGAN相比现有方法能产生更锐利的边缘、更少的模糊，更好地保留纹理和精细解剖细节，且参数更少、训练评估更快、模型更小。

Conclusion: MLP-SRGAN是一种有效的医学图像超分辨率方法，在提升图像质量的同时具有计算效率优势，代码已开源供研究使用。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture called MLP-SRGAN, which is a single-dimension
Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) that utilizes
Multi-Layer Perceptron Mixers (MLP-Mixers) along with convolutional layers to
upsample in the slice direction. MLP-SRGAN is trained and validated using high
resolution (HR) FLAIR MRI from the MSSEG2 challenge dataset. The method was
applied to three multicentre FLAIR datasets (CAIN, ADNI, CCNA) of images with
low spatial resolution in the slice dimension to examine performance on
held-out (unseen) clinical data. Upsampled results are compared to several
state-of-the-art SR networks. For images with high resolution (HR) ground
truths, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index
(SSIM) are used to measure upsampling performance. Several new structural,
no-reference image quality metrics were proposed to quantify sharpness (edge
strength), noise (entropy), and blurriness (low frequency information) in the
absence of ground truths. Results show MLP-SRGAN results in sharper edges, less
blurring, preserves more texture and fine-anatomical detail, with fewer
parameters, faster training/evaluation time, and smaller model size than
existing methods. Code for MLP-SRGAN training and inference, data generators,
models and no-reference image quality metrics will be available at

Conclusion: 预处理和学习型方法对于在不同条件下实现鲁棒的月球图像配准至关重要，SuperGlue是跨模态月球图像配准的最佳选择

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological

Conclusion: 混合专家模型可以在不修改网络结构的情况下提取良好棆准的预测不确定性估计，为安全关键应用提供更可靠的不确定性量化方法

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在光场超分辨率中存在多方向扫描策略效率低下、特征提取冗余的问题，且状态空间模型在保持空间-角度和视差信息方面存在局限

Method: 提出Sub-SS扫描策略和SSMB模块实现高效特征提取；采用双阶段建模：第一阶段使用SA-RSMB进行浅层空间-角度特征提取，第二阶段使用EPMB和EPTB双分支并行结构进行深层极线特征精炼

Result: LFMT在真实和合成光场数据集上显著超越现有最优方法，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的实质性提升

Conclusion: 所提出的混合Mamba-Transformer框架能够全面探索空间、角度和极线平面域的信息，为光场超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

Motivation: 现有端到端方法仅依赖指代目标进行监督，忽略了潜在前景目标的益处，且缺乏多粒度判别能力，难以在复杂场景中稳健识别对象。

Method: 提出PropVG框架，包含Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS)模块（句子和词汇级别的对比学习）和Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD)模块（融合对象和语义级信息）。

Conclusion: PropVG成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过集成proposal生成和对比学习机制，显著提升了视觉定位的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and
models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/PropVG.

TL;DR: TemporalFlowViz是一个用于分析超燃冲压发动机燃烧模拟中时间流场数据的可视化分析系统，通过深度学习、聚类和视觉语言模型来支持专家驱动的模式发现和解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超燃冲压发动机燃烧模拟产生的大规模、高维时间流场数据对视觉解释、特征区分和跨案例比较提出了重大挑战，需要新的分析方法来支持专家理解复杂的燃烧动力学。

Method: 使用预训练的Vision Transformer提取帧的高维嵌入，应用降维和基于密度的聚类发现潜在燃烧模式，构建时间轨迹跟踪模拟演化，并利用视觉语言模型生成自然语言摘要。

Result: 通过两个专家案例研究和专家反馈证明，TemporalFlowViz能够增强假设生成、支持可解释的模式发现，并促进大规模超燃冲压发动机燃烧分析中的知识发现。

Conclusion: TemporalFlowViz提供了一个有效的工作流程和系统，能够桥接潜在表示与专家推理之间的差距，支持对复杂燃烧动力学的深入分析。

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

TL;DR: OmniFHT是一个无需姿态信息的3D折射率重建框架，通过傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示，实现了高通量流式细胞术中对任意形状细胞的多轴旋转成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成像方法假设细胞进行均匀单轴旋转且需要已知每个帧的姿态，这限制了方法对近球形细胞的适用性，无法准确成像具有复杂旋转的不规则形状细胞，只能分析细胞群体的子集。

Method: 利用傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示(INRs)，在弱散射假设下联合优化每个细胞的未知旋转轨迹和体积结构，支持任意细胞几何形状和多轴旋转。

Result: 能够从稀疏采样投影和有限角度覆盖中实现准确重建，仅需10个视图或120度角度范围即可产生高保真结果，首次实现了整个流动细胞群体的原位高通量断层成像。

Conclusion: OmniFHT为流式细胞术平台提供了可扩展且无偏的无标记形态计量分析解决方案，突破了传统方法的限制。

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主航空机器人在远程指导和灾难响应中需要时实准确的3D重建，但全场景优化耗时过长，需要重点关注特定对象以提高效率。

Method: 首先使用语义高斯拟合生成粗糕的可分割场景，然后通过新的颜色基础筛选策略对语义对象进行精细处理，实现快速对象隔离。

Result: 在SCRREAM（实际外场）和NeRDS 360（合成室内）两个数据集上验证，训练时间比完整语义高斯拟合进程减少约25%，同时新视角合成质量更高。

Conclusion: CoRe-GS方法能够在保持高质量3D重建的同时显著缩短训练时间，通过重点关注关键对象来提高自主航空机器人的效率和实时性能力。

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前列腺癌冷冻消融治疗的手动规划过程依赖专家经验、耗时且结果不一致，需要自动化解决方案来提高治疗质量和可扩展性。

Method: 将冷冻消融规划建模为马尔可夫决策过程，在模拟环境中通过强化学习agent顺序选择冷冻消融针位置和冰球直径，基于肿瘤覆盖率的奖励函数指导学习最优策略。

Result: 在583例回顾性前列腺癌病例上评估，Cryo-RL相比最佳几何优化基线方法Dice系数提升超过8个百分点，达到人类专家水平，且规划时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够提供临床可行、可重复且高效的冷冻消融规划方案，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Motivation: 为开发自适应计算机化暴露疗法系统，需要能够根据患者反应动态调整视觉刺激，因此研究计算机视觉模型能否准确预测蜘蛛图像引发的恐惧水平

Method: 采用三种不同的预训练计算机视觉模型，通过迁移学习训练预测人类对313张标准化蜘蛛图像的恐惧评分（0-100分），使用交叉验证评估，并进行可解释性分析和分类错误分析

Result: 模型平均绝对误差在10.1到11.0之间，学习曲线分析显示减少数据集大小会显著降低性能，可解释性评估证实模型预测基于蜘蛛相关特征，远距离视图和人造/绘画蜘蛛等视觉条件与较高误差相关

Conclusion: 研究证明了可解释计算机视觉模型在预测恐惧评分方面的潜力，强调了模型可解释性和足够数据集大小对于开发有效情感感知治疗技术的重要性

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种简单的注意力基础多实例学习框架，用于自动化皮脊细胞图像中的液滴计数，并与基准MLP模型进行了性能比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动计数皮脊细胞中的液滴耗时而主观，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性。

Method: 使用Nile Red染色的皮脊细胞图像，通过数据增广扩展到约50,000个细胞。比较了两种模型：基准MLP模型和注意力基础MIL模型（使用ResNet-50特征），采用五折交叉验证。

Result: 基准MLP模型表现更稳定（平均MAE=5.6），而注意力MIL模型不太一致（平均MAE=10.7），但在某些折叠中表现更优。

Conclusion: 简单的集合级判断提供了健壮的基准方法，注意力MIL需要更好的池化策略和正则化才能充分发挥潜力。

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

Motivation: 单图像新视角合成任务由于未观察区域存在多重解释而高度不适定，现有方法往往基于模糊先验和输入视图附近的插值生成不可见区域，导致严重失真。

Method: 构建检索和增强系统，利用多模态大语言模型选择符合要求的参考图像；引入即插即用的适配器模块和多级隔离层动态生成目标视图的参考特征；设计解耦三重注意力机制有效对齐和整合多分支特征。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniView显著提升了新视角合成性能，在具有挑战性的数据集上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，UniView有效解决了单图像新视角合成中的失真问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

Motivation: 现有方法假设高质量输入，难以处理双源退化场景，需要手动选择多个预增强步骤，导致误差累积和性能下降

Method: 结合视觉语言模型进行退化感知，设计引导频率模态特定提取模块(GFMSE)进行频域退化抑制，以及引导空间模态聚合融合模块(GSMAF)进行跨模态退化过滤和特征聚合

Result: 在双源退化场景下相比现有算法和策略获得更优的融合性能

Conclusion: GD^2Fusion框架有效解决了双源退化场景下的图像融合问题，实现了端到端的退化感知和融合优化

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,

KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

Abstract: The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with

computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three
TL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from

ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will

model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

TL;DR: ADClick是一个用于工业异常检测的交互式图像分割算法，通过少量用户点击和文本描述生成像素级异常标注，显著提升异常检测模型性能。ADClick-Seg进一步通过跨模态框架结合视觉特征和文本提示，在多项指标上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业产品检测通常只使用正常样本训练异常检测模型，虽然可以收集缺陷样本但需要像素级标注，限制了可扩展性。需要一种更高效的标注方法来利用缺陷样本。

Method: 提出ADClick交互式图像分割算法，通过用户点击和文本描述生成像素级异常标注。ADClick-Seg采用跨模态框架，通过基于原型的方法对齐视觉特征和文本提示，结合像素级先验和语言引导线索。

Result: ADClick在MVTec AD上达到AP=96.1%。ADClick-Seg在多项指标上表现优异：AP=80.0%、PRO=97.5%、Pixel-AUROC=99.1%，在Multi-class异常检测任务中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: ADClick和ADClick-Seg通过交互式分割和跨模态融合，有效解决了工业异常检测中标注效率低的问题，显著提升了模型性能，为工业检测提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

TL;DR: GeoSplat是一个几何约束的优化框架，利用一阶和二阶几何先验改进高斯溅射的整个训练流程，包括初始化、梯度更新和致密化，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用低阶几何先验（如法向量），且通过噪声敏感方法估计不可靠。需要更鲁棒的几何约束来改进高斯溅射优化。

Method: 提出GeoSplat框架，利用主曲率初始化高斯尺度，基于局部流形等几何结构引入高效且抗噪声的估计方法，提供动态几何先验。

Result: 在多个数据集的新视角合成任务中，GeoSplat显著提升了高斯溅射性能，超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: GeoSplat通过引入高阶几何先验和鲁棒估计方法，有效改进了高斯溅射的优化过程，为3D重建提供了更好的几何约束框架。

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

Method: 提出了精心优化的ModelNet-R数据集，并设计了基于图的轻量级神经网络Point-SkipNet，采用高效采样、邻域分组和跳跃连接等技术。

Result: 在ModelNet-R上训练的模型表现出显著的性能提升，Point-SkipNet以更少的参数量达到了最先进的分类精度。

Conclusion: 数据集质量对于优化3D点云分类模型的效率至关重要，高质量数据集可以显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, the commonly used
ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D
data, size mismatches, and inadequate class differentiation, which hinder model
performance. This paper introduces ModelNet-R, a meticulously refined version
of ModelNet40 designed to address these issues and serve as a more reliable
benchmark. Additionally, this paper proposes Point-SkipNet, a lightweight
graph-based neural network that leverages efficient sampling, neighborhood
grouping, and skip connections to achieve high classification accuracy with
reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably,
Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a
substantially lower parameter count compared to contemporary models. This
research highlights the crucial role of dataset quality in optimizing model
efficiency for 3D point cloud classification. For more details, see the code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT)混合架构，结合CNN特征提取和Transformer关系建模能力，在面部美观度预测任务上达到新SOTA，Pearson相关系数0.9187


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN处理固定尺度特征，可能忽略不同粒度特征间的相互依赖关系，而面部美观度感知需要综合考虑局部和全局特征的复杂交互

Method: SIT架构：首先使用多尺度并行卷积模块捕获不同感受野的面部特征，然后将多尺度表示作为序列输入Transformer编码器，通过自注意力机制显式建模特征间交互关系

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准数据集上取得0.9187的Pearson相关系数，超越了之前的所有方法

Conclusion: 显式建模多尺度视觉线索的交互对于高性能面部美观度预测至关重要，SIT架构展示了CNN-Transformer混合模型在需要整体上下文理解的复杂图像回归任务中的潜力

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用稀疏混合专家(MoE)层替代CNN中的残差块或卷积层，在不增加推理成本的情况下提升模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，特别是在结合对抗训练时效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升卷积神经网络对抗对抗攻击的鲁棒性通常需要资源密集型对策，希望找到更高效的方法来增强模型鲁棒性。

Method: 在ResNet架构的深层阶段插入单个MoE层，结合对抗训练，使用CIFAR-100数据集进行实验，分析路由平衡机制对专家使用的影响。

Result: 在PGD和AutoPGD攻击下，MoE层结合对抗训练能持续提升鲁棒性；开关损失导致路由集中在少数专家上，意外使这些路径更加鲁棒；某些单个专家在鲁棒性上优于门控MoE模型。

Conclusion: 稀疏MoE层是提升CNN鲁棒性的有效方法，鲁棒子路径通过专家专业化出现，为设计更鲁棒的模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

Method: 基于ARC-AGI的问题设定，构建基于规则的任务，在网格环境中对对象应用可组合的变换，支持28种可互操作的变换的深度组合，并提供网格参数和对象属性的广泛控制。

Result: 能够创建数百万个独特任务规则，远超现有数据集规模，生成几乎无限的任务样本。基线实验显示最先进的视觉模型虽然域内性能强，但无法泛化到熟悉元素的新组合。

Conclusion: COGITAO作为一个开源框架，为组合性和泛化研究提供了强大的工具，揭示了当前模型在组合泛化方面的系统性失败，支持该领域的持续研究。

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is
key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in
state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce
COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark
designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual
domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs
rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain
performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to
support continued research in this field.

TL;DR: 深度学习模型在真实应用中遇到领域偏移问题，但源数据往往无法共享。这篇论文提出CRAFT方法，通过短路权重正则化和相似性正则化，在无源数据、少量标签目标数据的情况下实现半监督回归任务的领域适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实应用场景中，源数据往往因隐私或存储计算成本而无法共享，同时标签目标数据稀缺，而现有方法多为分类任务设计，不适用于回归问题。需要一种无源数据、半监督的回归领域适配方法。

Method: 基于Contradistinguisher(CUDA)框架，提出CRAFT方法：1)使用短路权重正则化来保持领域不变特征；2)利用目标域的标签和未标签数据通过相似性正则化来提升模型性能；3)适配于回归任务，通过领域特征的相似性来实现领域适配。

Result: 在脑电图(EEG)眼动预测和结构怠格照(MRI)脑龄预测两个神经科学数据集上，CRAFT在标签数据稀缺时比细调模型提升了达9%的根均方差错误(RMSE)。同时，CRAFT利用未标签目标数据，超过四种先进的无源领域适配模型，性能提升超过3%。在其他两个真实世界回归标准数据集上也显示了良好效果。

Conclusion: CRAFT是一种高效的无源数据半监督深度迁移学习方法，特别适用于生物医学领域中普遍存在的回归任务。该方法能够在源数据不可用、标签目标数据稀缺的情况下，通过利用未标签目标数据来提升模型的适配性能和准确性。

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

Result: 在单图片纹理重建任务中，在保真度和感知质量方面都超过了最先进的基线方法，每个形状仅需0.2秒

Conclusion: 该方法具有实用性，能够支持可扩展、高质量和可控的3D内容创建

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

Abstract: We present WinT3R, a feed-forward reconstruction model capable of online

that ensures sufficient information exchange among frames within the window,
thereby improving the quality of geometric predictions without large
computation. In addition, we leverage a compact representation of cameras and
maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera
pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,
camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive
experiments on diverse datasets. Code and model are publicly available at

TL;DR: SGS-3D是一个无需训练的3D实例分割精炼框架，通过"先分割后生长"策略，利用几何基元净化模糊的2D-3D提升掩码，并融合语义和几何信息来提高分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于2D-3D提升的3D实例分割方法由于提升过程中的累积误差、模糊语义指导和深度约束不足，难以产生精确的实例级分割结果。

Method: 提出"split-then-grow"框架：1）使用几何基元净化和分割模糊的提升掩码；2）在场景中将掩码生长为完整实例；3）引入掩码过滤策略利用3D几何基元共现性识别和移除模糊掩码；4）利用空间连续性和高级特征构建细粒度对象实例。

Result: 在ScanNet200、ScanNet++和KITTI-360数据集上的实验表明，SGS-3D显著提高了分割精度和鲁棒性，能够从预训练模型的不准确掩码中生成高保真对象实例，并在各种室内外环境中保持强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SGS-3D作为一种无需训练的精炼方法，通过联合融合语义和几何信息，有效解决了2D-3D提升方法中的模糊语义指导和深度约束不足问题，实现了高质量的3D实例分割。

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Conclusion: 该框架通过解决对比学习在手语识别中的特定问题，成功学习了更有意义的表示，为手语识别任务提供了有效的自监督解决方案

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

### [54] [The Ethical Compass of the Machine: Evaluating Large Language Models for Decision Support in Construction Project Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04505)
*Somtochukwu Azie,Yiping Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过定量和定性研究方法，评估了大语言模型在建筑项目管理中的伦理决策可靠性，发现LLMs在处理上下文细节和负责任方面存在显著缺陷，建议使用人类监督的决策支持工具而非自主代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在建筑项目管理这个高风险、伦理敏感领域作为决策支持工具的伦理可靠性和可靠性。

Method: 采用混合研究方法，包括：1）定量性能测试：使用新的伦理决策支持评估检查表(EDSAC)对两个领先LLMs进行12个真实伦理场景测试；2）定性分析：对12位行业专家进行半结构化访谈，了解专业意见。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在法律遵守等结构化领域表现賞得，但在处理上下文细节、确保负责任和提供透明推理方面存在显著缺陷。相关方对AI自主进行伦理判断持有保留态度，强烈建议强化人类监督。

Conclusion: 大语言模型目前最佳定位是作为决策支持工具，而非自主伦理代理。论文提供了可复制的EDSAC框架和可执行的建议。

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

*Wenxiao Wang,Priyatham Kattakinda,Soheil Feizi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro是一个框架无关的LLM智能体整体优化器，通过联合搜索图结构和节点配置来提升智能体质量，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器主要调整配置而固定图结构，无法解决结构性故障模式，需要一种能够同时优化图结构和配置的全面优化方法。

Method: Maestro框架通过联合搜索智能体的图结构（模块和信息流）和节点配置（模型、提示、工具等），利用反射性文本反馈来优先处理编辑，提高样本效率并针对特定故障模式。

Result: 在IFBench和HotpotQA基准测试中，Maestro平均优于MIPROv2、GEPA和GEPA+Merge分别12%、4.9%和4.86%；即使在仅优化提示的情况下，仍领先9.65%、2.37%和2.41%，且使用比GEPA更少的rollout。

Conclusion: 联合图结构和配置搜索能够解决仅提示调优无法修复的结构性故障模式，在多个应用中显示出显著优势，证明了整体优化方法的有效性。

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个框架，通过混合方法识别不同健康利益相关者的需求，指导LLM生成定制化的健康模拟解释，以解决现有通用摘要无法满足多样化信息需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于代理的建模与仿真方法在健康决策中潜力巨大，但由于模型复杂性难以被利益相关者使用。现有LLM生成的通用摘要无法满足临床医生、政策制定者、患者等不同群体的多样化信息需求和风格偏好。

Method: 采用混合方法设计：首先获取不同健康利益相关者的解释需求和风格偏好，然后通过可控属性调优等方法优化LLM生成定制化输出的能力，最后通过综合指标评估并进一步改进定制化摘要生成。

Result: 提出了一个逐步框架来系统识别利益相关者需求并指导LLM生成定制化的健康模拟解释。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了系统理解利益相关者解释需求的方法空白，能够帮助LLM生成更符合不同群体需求的定制化健康模拟解释，从而提高模型的可访问性和实用性。

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

Motivation: 传统AI基准测试难以捕捉模型的细微能力，特别是在物理世界建模方面，需要更符合人类认知的评估标准来提升模型行为的可解释性和适用性

Method: 基于Perception Test和OpenEQA基准，通过深度访谈和大规模调查识别关键认知技能（优先级排序、记忆、辨别、情境化），并将研究发现整合到基准设计中

Result: 研究发现参与者认为AI缺乏解释性和共情能力，但对AI性能有很高期望。通过整合人类认知洞察，提出了更符合人类对齐的评估框架

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了以用户为中心的AI评估的重要性，为研究人员和从业者提供了可操作的指南，既增强了当前基准测试实践，也为未来AI模型评估的进步奠定了基础

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional
benchmarks can fall short in attempting to capture the nuanced capabilities of
AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for
researchers and practitioners aiming to align AI capabilities with human
cognitive processes. Our approach both enhances current benchmarking practices
and sets the stage for future advancements in AI model evaluation.

TL;DR: 这篇位置论文提出使用大语言模型动态生成层次架构来构建显式世界模型，以解决复杂多满行动任务中的探索困难和稀疏奖励问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前人工智能在语言模型和代理模型方面取得进步，但精细的显式世界模型仍是关键瓶颈，特别是在复杂长期多满行动任务中。标准强化学习在高保真但结构平坦的模拟器中往往失败。

Method: 提出通过层次架构将复杂目标分解为结构化的子目标，并利用大语言模型动态生成这个层次架构。这种语言驱动的世界模型提供内在课程、密集有意义的学习信号和组合学习框架。

Result: 通过对2024年多满行动足球研究的系统评估，发现了一个明确的趋势：将符号和层次方法与多满行动强化学习结合，隐式或显式构建任务基世界模型来指导代理学习。

Conclusion: 通过构建具有显式、语言可配置任务层的环境，可以桥接低级反应行为和高级战略团队配合之间的间隔，为训练下一代智能代理创造强大且可通用的框架。

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WiA-LLM是一个为大型语言模型添加主动思考能力的新范式，通过整合假设分析(WIA)和强化学习环境反馈，使LLM能够预测未来状态而不仅仅是反应当前条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM擅长被动处理信息，但缺乏系统性探索假设未来的能力，无法在动态高风险场景中进行战略规划和实时决策，这限制了其实用性。

Method: 整合假设分析方法，通过改变输入变量评估假设场景，利用强化学习的环境反馈，动态模拟每个潜在行动的结果，使模型能够预测未来状态。

Result: 在王者荣耀复杂游戏环境中验证，WiA-LLM在预测游戏状态变化方面达到74.2%准确率（比基线提升高达两倍），在高难度场景中表现尤为显著。

Conclusion: 这是首个正式探索和整合假设分析能力到LLM中的工作，代表了LLM主动推理的根本性进步，为动态环境中的稳健决策提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

TL;DR: TalkToAgent是一个多代理LLM框架，通过五个专门化的LLM代理提供交互式自然语言解释，有效弥合复杂RL策略与领域专家之间的理解鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释强化学习(XRL)方法存在解释结果可理解性有限、工具覆盖孤立的问题，导致用户不确定使用哪种工具，需要一种更综合的解释框架。

Method: 采用五代理架构（协调器、解释器、编码器、评估器、调试器），自动将用户查询映射到相关XRL工具，提供关键状态变量、预期结果或反事实解释。

Result: 在四水箱过程控制问题上验证，成功高精度映射用户查询到XRL任务，编码器-调试器交互最小化反事实生成失败，定性评估确认有效解释智能体行为。

Conclusion: TalkToAgent框架成功提供了交互式自然语言解释，能够有效解释RL智能体行为并将其在问题领域中进行情境化理解。

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

Conclusion: 这是首次系统性描述语言模型长期合作行为的研究，为今后在更复杂人工智能-人类混合社会环境中的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中专家智能体之间深度协作的语言交互瓶颈问题，现有工作在智能体选择和结果聚合方面已有进展，但高效的深度协作仍是一个关键挑战

Method: 引入协作知识模型(CKM)使智能体能够动态感知合作者的认知状态，通过实时认知差距分析自适应调整通信行为（内容焦点、细节层次、表达风格），使用学习策略

Result: 在复杂推理和问题解决基准测试中，OSC显著提高了任务性能和通信效率，将"并行工作的个体"转变为"深度协作的认知团队"

Conclusion: 该框架不仅优化了多智能体协作，还为LLM智能体交互行为提供了新的见解，解决了深度协作的关键瓶颈问题

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

TL;DR: SparkUI-Parser是一个新颖的端到端GUI解析框架，通过连续坐标建模和拒绝机制，显著提高了定位精度和推理速度，能够解析整个界面而不仅仅是预定义元素集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在GUI感知中存在两个主要问题：1）基于文本自回归机制的离散坐标建模导致定位精度低、推理速度慢；2）只能定位预定义元素集，无法解析整个界面，限制了广泛应用和下游任务支持。

Method: 提出连续坐标建模方法，在预训练MLLM基础上增加token路由器和坐标解码器；引入基于改进匈牙利匹配算法的拒绝机制来识别和拒绝不存在的元素；构建ScreenParse基准测试来系统评估GUI模型的结构感知能力。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-v2、CAGUI-Grounding和ScreenParse等多个基准测试中，该方法始终优于最先进的方法，显著提升了定位精度和推理速度。

Conclusion: SparkUI-Parser通过连续坐标建模和拒绝机制，有效解决了现有MLLMs在GUI解析中的局限性，实现了更高的定位精度、更快的推理速度和更细粒度的界面解析能力，为下游任务提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at

Result: 实验结果表明该方法提供了一致且可解释的熟练度级别定义，改善了对话AI的透明度。

Conclusion: 基于本体的方法能够有效形式化对话特征，为LLM的可控对话生成提供了可解释和一致的框架，提高了对话AI系统的透明度和可靠性。

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

TL;DR: 提出了DOVIS协议和AgentRank-UC算法，用于在缺乏全局交互网络的Web of Agents环境中实现基于性能和可信度的智能体排名


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体将互联网转变为机器原生生态系统，但缺乏像PageRank那样的全局透明网络，使用信号分散且私有，需要协调机制来实现基于性能的智能体排名

Method: 提出五层操作协议DOVIS（发现、编排、验证、激励、语义）收集最小化隐私保护的使用和性能聚合数据，在此基础上实现AgentRank-UC算法，结合使用频率和胜任力（结果质量、成本、安全性、延迟）进行统一排名

Result: 通过仿真实验和理论分析证明了协议的收敛性、鲁棒性和抗Sybil攻击能力，展示了协调协议和性能感知排名在实现可扩展可信智能体Web中的可行性

Conclusion: DOVIS协议和AgentRank-UC算法为解决Web of Agents中的智能体排名问题提供了可行的技术方案，为构建规模化可信的智能体互联网奠定了基础

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时扩展方法主要依赖冗余采样，忽略了历史经验的利用，限制了计算效率。需要一种能够有效利用历史尝试信息的方法来提高推理效率。

Method: 提出Sticker-TTS框架，使用三个协作的LRM模型，通过提取、精炼和重用关键信息（称为stickers）进行多轮推理。采用两阶段优化策略，结合模仿学习和自我改进实现渐进式精炼。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试（AIME-24、AIME-25、OlymMATH）上，Sticker-TTS在相同推理预算下持续超越强基线方法，包括自一致性和先进强化学习方法。

Conclusion: 研究证明了sticker引导的历史经验利用的有效性，为大型推理模型的测试时扩展提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProToM是一个基于心智理论的AI系统，通过贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标，提供针对性反馈来促进多智能体系统中的亲社会行为，在任务成功率和完成时间上优于现有大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中智能体在追求独立目标时难以确定何时以及如何协助他人的合作挑战，促进亲社会行为（即使与自身目标不完全一致但有益他人的行动）。

Method: ProToM系统：1）使用贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标分布；2）基于推断的目标分布，通过最大化期望效用来选择上下文敏感的针对性反馈进行沟通。

Result: 在Doors、Keys和Gems以及Overcooked两个多智能体环境中测试，ProToM相比最先进的大型语言和推理模型：提供更有针对性和有用的反馈，获得更高的成功率、更短的任务完成时间，并持续受到人类用户偏好。

Conclusion: 现有大型语言模型在提供上下文接地且时机恰当的反馈方面存在不足，导致更高的通信开销和任务加速问题；而ProToM方法能有效促进多智能体合作，实现更好的协作效果。

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies
in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto
standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although
preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the
language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.
In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

Conclusion: LatticeWorld提供了一个简单有效的3D世界生成框架，显著提升了3D环境生产的工业效率，为虚拟世界创建提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo

TL;DR: 量子机器学习安全监控方法Q-SafeML，通过量子特有统计距离测量评估模型准确性，应对概念漏泄问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习(QML)在安全关键系统中的应用增多，但现有的经典安全监控方法不适用于QML，需要专门的安全机制

Method: 基于SafeML方法，采用量子特有的统计距离测量来评估模型准确性，从数据集驱动转向模型依赖的后分类评估

Result: 在QCNN和VQC模型上进行实验，Q-SafeML能够检测运行数据与训练数据之间的距离，应对概念漏泄

Conclusion: Q-SafeML提供了一种有效的量子机器学习安全监控方案，增强了系统的透明性和安全性，支持人类监督

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

Motivation: 深度学习在金融领域的应用需要可解释的AI，传统方法虽然在其他领域表现良好，但不完全适合金融领域，因为金融专家使用不同的指标来评估模型性能。

Method: 引入基于关键量化金融指标的财务基础损失函数（夏普比率、利润损失、最大回撤），并提出换手率正则化方法来约束生成头寸的换手率在预定范围内。

Result: 研究结果表明，提出的损失函数结合换手率正则化，在算法交易指标评估中优于传统的均方误差损失函数。

Conclusion: 财务基础指标能够提升交易策略和投资组合优化中的预测性能。

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RL方法在自我改进任务中需要预设固定最大迭代深度的问题，这种设定既昂贵又随意，需要一种能够利用自我改进任务递归结构的方法。

Method: ExIt方法通过选择性采样训练过程中遇到的最具信息量的中间部分历史状态，将这些起点作为新的自我迭代任务实例，训练自我改进策略，并可结合显式探索机制维持任务多样性。

Result: 在数学竞赛、多轮工具使用和机器学习工程等多个领域，ExIt策略能够产生在测试任务实例上表现出强推理时自我改进能力的策略，且能够在超出训练时平均迭代深度的步数预算内迭代达到更高性能。

Conclusion: ExIt方法成功解决了自我改进任务中的迭代深度限制问题，通过自课程学习机制实现了有效的多步自我改进能力。

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

Conclusion: 该适配性采样策略具有广泛适用性，可扩展到其他逆问题，为传统固定数据集训练提供了可扩展且实用的替代方案。

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

Conclusion: 量子信息特征和自适应任务加权增强的多任务分子学习具有有效性和高效性，为ADMET预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

TL;DR: 代表性相似性量度的系统性评估框架，通过三种分离度指标评估常用相似性量度的区分能力，发现更严格的对齐约束提高分离性，软匹配方法表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对不同模型家族间代表性相似性量度区分能力的系统性比较研究，需要建立量化框架来评估这些量度的相对敏感性。

Method: 提出量化框架，使用信号检测理论的dprime、过渡系数和ROC-AUC三种分离度指标，在不同网络架构（CNN、ViT、Swin、ConvNeXt）和训练方式（监督/自监督）上评估RSA、线性预测性、Procrustes和软匹配等常用相似性量度。

Result: 分离性随着量度对齐约束的严格程度而系统性提高；软匹配方法表现最佳，其次是Procrustes对齐和线性预测性；RSA等非拟合方法也展现出良好的分离性。

Conclusion: 这是通过分离性视角对相似性量度的首次系统比较，明确了各量度的相对敏感性，为大规模模型和脑科学比较提供了量度选择的指南。

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

Result: 经验结果表明，该方法在分辨率变化下保持校准覆盖且变化较小，在超分辨率任务中实现了更好的覆盖性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将共形预测扩展到函数空间，为神经算子提供了有效的有限样本不确定性量化框架，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管注意力机制在Transformer模型中扮演核心角色，但其数学基础以及与特征多义性、叠加和模型性能等概念的关系仍然理解不足，需要更深入的理论解释。

Method: 在固定多项回归设置中优化潜在特征，分析最优解与注意力块诱导动态的一致性，将Transformer表示演化解释为恢复最优分类特征的轨迹。

Conclusion: 该研究为注意力机制提供了新的理论解释框架，将Transformer的内部表示演化与最优特征恢复过程联系起来，增强了对其工作机制的理解。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究差分隐私模型下的随机凸优化问题，针对满足Tsybakov噪声条件的损失函数，提出了新的隐私保护算法，获得了与Lipschitz常数无关的效用上界，并建立了匹配的下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DP-SCO研究通常假设损失函数是Lipschitz连续的，但在实际应用中，损失函数的Lipschitz常数可能非常大甚至无界。本文旨在研究在更一般的Tsybakov噪声条件下，如何设计有效的差分隐私优化算法。

Method: 针对满足Tsybakov噪声条件且梯度具有有界矩的损失函数，设计了(ε,δ)-DP算法。首先处理θ≥2的Lipschitz情况，然后扩展到θ≥θ̅>1的一般情况，并分析了小隐私预算下的性能。

Result: 获得了与Lipschitz常数无关的效用上界：Õ((r̃_{2k}(1/√n + √d/(nε))^{(k-1)/k})^{θ/(θ-1)})。对于小隐私预算，即使损失函数非Lipschitz，也能获得类似上界。同时建立了匹配的ρ-zCDP下界。

Conclusion: 本文证明了在Tsybakov噪声条件下，即使损失函数的Lipschitz常数很大或无界，仍然可以设计有效的差分隐私优化算法，并获得与经典情况相匹配的理论保证，扩展了DP-SCO的理论框架。

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

TL;DR: 深度学习可以准确检测复杂系统中的闪烁现象（噪声驱动的状态切换），这是系统韧性降低的早期预警信号，在气候、生态、金融等多个领域具有重要应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闪烁现象是复杂系统（如气候系统、生态系统、金融市场）韧性降低的标志性特征，可能预示着难以预测的关键状态转变。虽然深度学习在预测临界点方面表现出强大能力，但其在检测闪烁现象方面的潜力尚未被探索。

Method: 使用卷积长短期记忆（CNN LSTM）模型，在由简单多项式函数加噪声生成的合成时间序列上进行训练，然后将训练好的模型应用于各种随机系统和实证数据集。

Result: 模型能够准确识别闪烁模式，尽管在简化的动力学系统上训练，但能够泛化到不同的随机系统，并在实证数据（如睡鼠体温记录和非洲湿润期古气候代理数据）中可靠地检测到闪烁现象。

Conclusion: 深度学习能够从噪声非线性时间序列中提取早期预警信号，为识别各种动力系统中的不稳定性提供了一个灵活的框架。

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

Motivation: 现有地图融合方法存在两个主要限制：(1)只能处理线性对象（如道路网络），无法扩展到非线性对象；(2)基于预定义规则的启发式算法，无法以数据驱动方式学习实体匹配。

Method: KRaft包含三个部分：知识图谱构建（将地理空间数据库表示为知识图谱）、地图匹配（使用知识图谱对齐方法和地理空间特征编码器匹配实体）、地图合并（使用混合整数线性规划公式一致地合并匹配实体）。

Result: 实验评估显示KRaft在地图融合任务中不仅相比最先进方法和基线方法表现出色，其各个模块（如地图匹配和地图合并）也分别优于传统的匹配和合并方法。

Conclusion: KRaft通过学习驱动的方法有效解决了地图融合中的关键挑战，能够全面融合地理空间数据库而不引入不一致性，为数字地图的准确性和时效性更新提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习中广泛讨论频谱行为，但优化器自身的频谱偏好仍不明确。研究发现一阶优化器具有内在的频率偏好，显著影响优化路径。

Method: 提出NSF框架：将优化器视为频谱控制器，通过p指数扩展第二矩项（支持正负指数）和循环调度，动态平衡高低频信息，周期性重加权频率带。

Result: 实验表明自适应方法偏向低频，SGD接近中性，负指数放大高频信息。循环调度拓宽频谱覆盖，改善跨频带融合，在多个基准测试中一致降低测试误差，某些任务仅用1/4训练成本即可达到基线精度。

Conclusion: NSF揭示了优化器作为主动频谱控制器的作用，为一阶优化提供了统一、可控且高效的框架，即使在损失较高时也能提高精度，促进早期决策边界对齐。

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

Motivation: 主流解码策略如beam search缺乏可证明的覆盖保证，难以平衡搜索效率与多样化轨迹需求，特别是在需要长尾序列的实际应用中

Method: 在保形预测框架内提出的模型无关解码策略，通过理论分析建立PAC风格的泛化边界

Result: 理论证明CoVeR能够渐近地实现至少1-α的覆盖率，其中α∈(0,1)是任意目标水平

Conclusion: CoVeR为解决解码策略的覆盖保证问题提供了理论保证的解决方案，特别适用于需要多样化长尾序列的实际应用场景

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

Motivation: I-Con框架揭示了现有表示学习方法隐含地最小化数据分布与学习分布之间的KL散度，但KL散度的不对称性和无界性可能导致优化问题，且可能与真实目标不一致。

Method: 提出Beyond I-Con框架，探索替代的统计散度（如总变差距离、有界f-散度）和相似性核函数（如距离核代替角度核），系统性地发现新的损失函数。

Result: 在DINO-ViT嵌入的无监督聚类中达到SOTA；在监督对比学习中超越标准方法；在降维任务中获得更好的定性结果和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 统计散度和相似性核函数的选择对表示学习优化至关重要，Beyond I-Con框架为系统探索这些选择提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

Conclusion: 将经典统计洞察融入现代深度学习框架对时间序列预测具有显著益处，验证了传统方法与现代架构融合的价值。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

Conclusion: 深度学习模型特别是CNN-RNN混合架构能够高效地从EEG信号中检测眩眼，为计算眩眼流率和其他统计指标提供了可靠的技术支撑。

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently
outperformed other models and achieved the best blink detection accuracy of
93.8%, 95.4% and 95.8% with 1, 3, and 5 channels in the healthy cohort and
correspondingly 73.8%, 75.4% and 75.8% in patients with PD. The paper compares
neural networks for the task of segmenting EEG recordings to involuntary blinks
and no blinks allowing for computing blink rate and other statistics.

TL;DR: 提出使用双随机归一化方法分离混淆矩阵中的类别相似性和分布偏差因素，从而更准确地诊断模型行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混淆矩阵值同时受类别相似性（模型容易混淆的类别）和分布偏差（训练测试集分布不均）影响，难以区分两者的独立贡献

Method: 引入基于迭代比例拟合的双随机归一化方法，这是行列归一化的泛化，能够恢复类别相似性的底层结构

Result: 该方法成功分离了误差来源，支持更精准的模型行为诊断和针对性改进，并在模型内部类别表示空间中提供了几何解释

Conclusion: 双随机归一化提供了一种有效工具来理解混淆矩阵背后的因素，为分类器评估和改进提供了更深层次的洞察

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

TL;DR: NeuSA是一种基于谱方法的物理信息神经网络，通过谱基投影和神经ODE集成来解决PINNs在复杂初值问题中的收敛困难、因果性违反和频谱偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MLP-based PINNs在处理复杂初值问题时经常无法收敛，导致解违反因果性并存在对低频分量的频谱偏差。

Method: NeuSA学习PDE在谱基上的投影，获得动力学的有限维表示，然后通过适应的神经ODE进行集成，利用谱表示的高频分量克服频谱偏差，继承NODE的因果结构，并基于经典方法初始化训练。

Result: 在线性和非线性波动方程的基准测试中，NeuSA相比其他架构表现出更强的性能，具有更快的收敛速度、改进的时间一致性和更高的预测精度。

Conclusion: NeuSA通过结合谱方法和神经ODE，有效解决了PINNs在复杂PDE求解中的关键问题，为物理信息神经网络提供了新的架构设计思路。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

Conclusion: 通过分析批归一化层对TTA稳定性的影响，提出了基于梯度感知和平坦最小值优化的稳定TTA方法，有效解决了模型崩溃问题，为TTA在实际部署中的应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising

necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyPINO是一个多物理神经算子，通过超网络和混合监督实现参数化PDE的零样本泛化，无需任务特定微调，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统物理信息神经网络(PINNs)需要针对每个PDE问题单独训练的问题，开发一个能够零样本泛化到各类参数化PDE的统一框架，提高计算效率和准确性。

Method: 结合Swin Transformer超网络和混合监督：使用MMS生成的解析解作为标签数据，以及物理信息目标优化的无标签样本。模型将PDE参数映射到目标PINNs，并引入迭代精炼过程生成集成解。

Result: 在7个基准问题上实现强零样本准确性，优于U-Nets、Poseidon和PINO。迭代精炼过程在6个基准上实现误差逐步降低，最佳情况下平均L2损失提升100倍以上。微调时收敛更快且最终误差更低。

Conclusion: HyPINO展示了作为扩展神经算子解决复杂非线性高维PDE问题的基础潜力，具有显著提高的准确性和降低的计算成本。

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 细粒度标签训练并不总能提升分类性能，其效果取决于数据几何结构、标签层次关系、数据集大小和模型容量等因素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在层次化标签分类问题中，使用更细粒度标签进行训练是否能普遍提升模型性能，以及影响这种策略效果的关键因素

Method: 使用真实和合成数据集进行实验，分析数据几何结构、标签层次关系、数据集大小和模型容量对细粒度训练效果的影响

Result: 细粒度标签训练并非普遍有效，其效果高度依赖于数据几何结构与标签层次的关系，以及数据集大小和模型容量等条件

Conclusion: 细粒度训练策略的有效性是有条件的，需要根据具体的数据特征和模型配置来评估是否采用这种训练方式

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习理论主要研究非自适应敌手，但现实世界中敌手能够拦截学习器请求的样本并进行针对性修改，因此需要研究自适应敌手的可学习性问题。

Method: 提出了针对自适应敌手的可学习性一般概念，考虑了敌手的预算限制，通过理论分析比较了自适应和非自适应敌手下的学习条件。

Result: 证明了在加性自适应敌手下的可学习性条件严格强于加性非自适应敌手下的可学习性条件。

Conclusion: 自适应敌手的存在显著增加了学习难度，需要更强的学习条件来保证可学习性，这对现实世界中的对抗性学习具有重要意义。

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed
articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods
were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on
complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a
self-contained overview that not only summarizes the state of the field but
also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and
integrating foundational models with federated learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在生物医学信号处理中的计算资源需求大、模型较大的挑战，特别是在需要实时检测或资源有限的环境中。

Method: 采用结构剪枝技术，基于卷积内核对模型预测的重要性移除50%的内核，结合轻度早停止阻止过拟合。

Result: 在剪枝50%权重和内存后，模型准确玉从92.78%提升到92.87%，macro-F1分数从0.8686提升到0.8707，保持了预测能力。

Conclusion: 结构剪枝能够有效移除模型冗余、改善模型的普遍化能力，结合轻度早停止可以在资源有限的环境中提高狂狂检测的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力引导、层自适应复合令牌的KV缓存压缩框架，通过聚合注意力分数估计令牌重要性，选择头特定令牌并对齐到复合令牌中，保持现有推理引擎所需的统一缓存结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的KV缓存大小随上下文长度和模型深度线性增长，成为长上下文推理的主要瓶颈。现有压缩方法要么采用刚性启发式方法，要么破坏张量布局，或需要专门计算内核。

Method: 使用注意力引导的层自适应复合令牌方法：聚合注意力分数估计令牌重要性，独立选择头特定令牌，对齐到复合令牌中保持统一缓存结构，并通过全局分配机制自适应调整各层保留预算。

Result: 实现了显著的内存减少同时保持准确性，在结构化和非结构化方法中表现一致优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法完全兼容标准推理流程，为高效长上下文LLM部署提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based
approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead
remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training
framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient
cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales
and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to
3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while
cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further
demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing
units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over
the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代强化学习算法通常假设后继度量具有低秩结构，但本文发现这种假设不成立，需要研究移位后的后继度量才能获得有效的低秩表示。

Method: 提出移位后继度量的概念，推导Type II Poincaré不等式来量化所需移位量，建立与局部混合性质的联系，并通过实验验证理论发现。

Result: 证明了移位后继度量确实具有低秩结构，所需移位量通常很小，且移位操作能显著提升目标条件强化学习的性能。

Conclusion: 移位操作是获得有效低秩近似的关键，移位后继度量为强化学习提供了更准确的理论基础，并带来了性能改进。

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

Conclusion: KAN模型为增强AGC网络安全提供了可靠且可解释的方法，能够有效检测隐蔽的网络攻击。

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report
introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and
frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch
convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and
frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a
Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When
benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,
outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker
performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our
approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it
ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic
scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the
art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media
verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.

Conclusion: 通过深度学习与传统优化算法相结合，可以有效提升分布式优化算法的性能，为大规模机器学习提供更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

TL;DR: 通过深度强化学习框架实现个性化广告推荐系统中的多目标优化，替代传统手动调优方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动调优广告推荐系统的排名效用函数存在次优结果、缺乏个性化和适应性等问题，需要更科学的多目标优化方法

Method: 提出DRL-PUT框架，将问题形式化为强化学习任务，直接从在线服务日志中学习最优策略模型，避免估计价值函数的挑战

Result: 在Pinterest广告推荐系统中的在线A/B实验显示，与基准手动调优方法相比，点击率提高9.7%，长点击率提高7.7%

Conclusion: DRL-PUT框架能够有效解决广告推荐系统中的多目标优化问题，提供了更优称的个性化调优能力

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.

TL;DR: REMOTE是一个统一的多模态关系抽取框架，通过多级最优传输和专家混合机制，能够同时提取文本实体和视觉对象之间的模态内和模态间关系，解决了现有方法只能提取单一类型关系三元组的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态关系抽取方法通常只能提取单一类型的关系三元组，无法处理超出指定类型的关系。直接组合这些方法无法捕捉动态的跨模态交互，且会引入显著的计算冗余。

Method: 提出了REMOTE框架，采用专家混合机制动态选择不同关系三元组类型的最优交互特征，并使用多级最优传输融合模块保留低级特征同时维持多层编码，生成更具表现力的表示。

Result: 在新建的UMRE数据集和两个公开MRE数据集上的广泛实验表明，REMOTE能够有效提取各种类型的关系三元组，在几乎所有指标上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: REMOTE框架通过统一的方法解决了多模态关系抽取中的类型限制问题，通过动态特征选择和特征保留机制实现了优异的性能，为多模态知识图谱构建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal relation extraction (MRE) is a crucial task in the fields of
Knowledge Graph and Multimedia, playing a pivotal role in multimodal knowledge
graph construction. However, existing methods are typically limited to
extracting a single type of relational triplet, which restricts their ability
to extract triplets beyond the specified types. Directly combining these
methods fails to capture dynamic cross-modal interactions and introduces
significant computational redundancy. Therefore, we propose a novel
\textit{unified multimodal Relation Extraction framework with Multilevel
Optimal Transport and mixture-of-Experts}, termed REMOTE, which can
simultaneously extract intra-modal and inter-modal relations between textual
entities and visual objects. To dynamically select optimal interaction features
for different types of relational triplets, we introduce mixture-of-experts
mechanism, ensuring the most relevant modality information is utilized.
Additionally, considering that the inherent property of multilayer sequential
encoding in existing encoders often leads to the loss of low-level information,
we adopt a multilevel optimal transport fusion module to preserve low-level
features while maintaining multilayer encoding, yielding more expressive
representations. Correspondingly, we also create a Unified Multimodal Relation
Extraction (UMRE) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework,
encompassing diverse cases where the head and tail entities can originate from
either text or image. Extensive experiments show that REMOTE effectively
extracts various types of relational triplets and achieves state-of-the-art
performanc on almost all metrics across two other public MRE datasets. We
release our resources at https://github.com/Nikol-coder/REMOTE.

Abstract: Emotion recognition is essential for applications in affective computing and
behavioral prediction, but conventional systems relying on single-modality data
often fail to capture the complexity of affective states. To address this
limitation, we propose an emotion recognition framework that achieves accurate
multimodal alignment of Electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye movement data
through a hybrid architecture based on cross-modal attention mechanism.
Experiments on the SEED-IV dataset demonstrate that our method achieve 90.62%
accuracy. This work provides a promising foundation for leveraging multimodal
data in emotion recognition
