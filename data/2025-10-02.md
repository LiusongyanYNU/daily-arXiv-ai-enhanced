### [1] [POVQA: Preference-Optimized Video Question Answering with Rationales for Data Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01009)
*Ashim Dahal,Ankit Ghimire,Saydul Akbar Murad,Nick Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出POVQA方法，通过时间池化将每秒视频压缩为单帧图像，结合SFT和DPO训练LVLMs，在视频问答任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频问答中上下文窗口限制问题，现有方法只能处理50秒视频，需要更高效的数据压缩方法。

Method: 使用多种时间池化方法（运动模糊、加权平均等）将视频压缩为1fps，在ReasonVQA数据集上对QWEN-2.5-VL 7B进行SFT和DPO训练。

Result: 在ReasonVQA数据集上，F1分数从0.212提升到0.543，BLEU-4从0.031提升到0.291，ROUGE-L从0.196提升到0.528，推理质量显著提高。

Conclusion: POVQA方法在不同池化方案下都表现出强鲁棒性，能有效总结时间证据，在TVQA数据集上也有良好零样本表现。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

### [2] [Code2Video: A Code-centric Paradigm for Educational Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01174)
*Yanzhe Chen,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Code2Video是一个基于代码的代理框架，通过可执行的Python代码生成教育视频。该框架包含三个协作代理：规划器、编码器和批评器，在MMMC基准测试中表现出色，比直接代码生成提升40%，视频质量接近人工制作教程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在制作专业教育视频方面存在局限，无法满足学科知识、精确视觉结构和连贯过渡的要求。直觉上，通过可渲染环境的操作能更好地解决这些需求，而逻辑命令（如代码）可以明确控制这种环境。

Method: 提出Code2Video框架，包含三个代理：1) Planner：将讲座内容结构化并准备视觉资源；2) Coder：将结构化指令转换为可执行Python代码，采用范围引导的自动修复提高效率；3) Critic：利用视觉语言模型和视觉锚点提示优化空间布局并确保清晰度。

Result: 在MMMC基准测试中，Code2Video比直接代码生成提升40%，生成的视频质量与人工制作教程相当。通过TeachQuiz指标量化了VLM通过观看生成视频恢复知识的能力。

Conclusion: Code2Video展示了作为可扩展、可解释和可控方法的潜力，为教育视频生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.

### [3] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数，用于提升高光谱单图像超分辨率的空间细节恢复和光谱保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在高光谱单图像超分辨率任务中难以同时恢复精细空间细节和保持宽波长范围的光谱保真度

Method: 提出SSUF模块（结合光谱解混和光谱-空间特征提取），集成到标准2D卷积架构中，并使用自定义的空间-光谱梯度损失函数

Result: 在三个公共遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，所提出的混合深度学习模型在降低模型复杂度的同时实现了有竞争力的性能

Conclusion: SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数有效提升了高光谱图像超分辨率的空间分辨率和光谱完整性

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [4] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，通过任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来，揭示幻觉源于数据分布的可预测模式和继承偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言和视觉模型在现实应用中的广泛采用使得解决幻觉问题变得紧迫，这些错误可能在部署过程中传播错误信息，造成财务和运营损害。目前对幻觉的理解仍不完整且碎片化，缺乏连贯理解会导致解决方案只缓解表面症状而非根本原因。

Method: 首先提出统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，然后使用任务-模态交织方法将这些幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来。

Result: 调查发现幻觉往往源于数据分布的可预测模式和继承偏见。

Conclusion: 通过深化对幻觉的理解，本调查为在现实世界生成式AI系统中开发更稳健有效的幻觉解决方案奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [5] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RobustVLA方法，通过多模态对抗训练和一致性约束，提升视觉-语言-动作模型在动作、指令、环境和观测等多模态扰动下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要针对简单的视觉扰动，忽略了动作、指令、环境和观测等多模态扰动，导致在真实世界部署时鲁棒性不足。

Method: 1) 输出鲁棒性：通过离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况的动作噪声；2) 输入鲁棒性：强制输入变化时保持动作一致性；3) 多扰动处理：将鲁棒性建模为多臂老虎机问题，使用UCB算法识别最有害噪声。

Result: 在LIBERO基准上，RobustVLA相比基线在17种扰动下分别获得12.6%和10.4%的绝对提升，推理速度快50.6倍，在真实FR5机器人上获得65.6%的绝对提升。

Conclusion: RobustVLA能有效提升VLA模型在多模态扰动下的鲁棒性，特别是在真实机器人场景中表现优异。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [6] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CADC框架，通过无监督发现内在能力、基于影响力的数据归因和平衡课程设计，仅需5%原始数据就能超越全数据训练效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令调优方法将模型视为黑盒，忽视潜在学习能力，导致数据预算减少时性能退化

Method: 无监督发现内在能力→基于梯度影响力归因训练数据→平衡选择和分阶段排序的课程设计

Result: 仅使用5%原始数据就在多模态基准测试中超越全数据训练效果

Conclusion: 内在能力是模型学习的基本构建块，CADC为指令数据筛选提供了原则性范式

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [7] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了C³B基准，这是一个多文化、多任务、多语言的文化意识能力基准，包含2000多张图像和18000多个QA对，用于评估多模态大语言模型的文化意识能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在任务设计上缺乏难度进展，且缺少跨语言任务。真实世界图像通常只包含单一文化，使得基准测试相对容易。

Method: 构建了三个难度递进的任务：从基础视觉识别到高级文化冲突理解，再到文化内容生成。包含2000多张图像和18000多个QA对。

Result: 评估了11个开源MLLMs，发现MLLMs与人类表现之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: C³B对当前MLLMs构成重大挑战，鼓励未来研究提升MLLMs的文化意识能力。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [8] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了6个开源文本到图像模型在医疗职业图像生成中的性别偏见，发现所有模型都存在系统性的职业刻板印象，但不同模型对提示词的敏感度差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在专业、教育和创意场景中广泛应用，但其输出往往嵌入和放大社会偏见，特别是性别偏见，需要系统评估和解决。

Method: 使用6个先进的开源模型，针对5种医院相关职业和5种肖像修饰词组合生成100张图像，分析性别分布和提示词敏感性。

Result: 所有模型都表现出职业刻板印象：护士均为女性，外科医生主要为男性。不同模型偏差程度各异，Qwen-Image和SDXL男性主导最明显，FLUX.1-dev偏向女性。提示词如"corporate"强化男性形象，"beautiful"偏向女性。

Conclusion: TTI模型中的性别偏见是系统性的且模型特定的，提示词措辞对人口统计结果有重要影响，需要偏见感知设计、平衡默认值和用户指导来防止职业刻板印象的强化。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [9] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer是一个基于强化学习的提示词窃取框架，能够从少量示例图像中恢复出提示词模板，攻击成本仅为现有基线的13%，揭示了提示词交易中的安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型催生了提示词交易市场，但提示词本身存在被窃取的安全风险，这种风险尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 将模板窃取视为顺序决策问题，采用基于相似度的反馈信号作为奖励函数，有效探索提示词空间。

Result: 在公开基准测试中达到最先进性能，攻击成本降低至现有基线的13%以下，能够有效泛化到不同图像风格并窃取未见过的提示词模板。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了提示词交易中紧迫的安全威胁，为新兴MLLMs市场制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [10] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EDCT方法，通过自动生成反事实测试来验证视觉语言模型解释的忠实性，发现模型解释与预测因果因素之间存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型生成的解释听起来合理但可能不反映真实预测因素，这种可信度与忠实性不匹配带来技术和治理风险。

Method: EDCT方法：获取模型答案和解释→解析解释为可测试视觉概念→通过生成修复生成针对性反事实编辑→使用LLM辅助分析计算反事实一致性分数。

Result: 在120个OK-VQA示例和多个VLM上，EDCT揭示了显著的忠实性差距，并提供了监管对齐的审计证据。

Conclusion: EDCT能够自动检测模型解释的忠实性问题，为模型可信度评估提供有效工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [11] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDe是一个无需训练的多模态大语言模型框架，通过分层解耦方法解决高分辨率图像中的背景干扰问题，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，传统观点认为是物体尺寸问题，但本文发现主要原因是复杂背景干扰。

Method: 提出分层解耦框架HiDe：1）Token-wise Attention Decoupling解耦问题token识别关键信息；2）Layout-Preserving Decoupling解耦目标区域与背景，重建紧凑表示。

Result: 在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上达到SOTA，Qwen2.5-VL 7B和InternVL3 8B分别达到92.1%和91.6%，比之前无需训练方法节省75%内存。

Conclusion: HiDe证明了背景干扰是MLLM高分辨率图像理解的主要瓶颈，通过分层解耦方法有效解决了这一问题，无需额外训练即可显著提升性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [12] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FSDENet网络，通过结合空间域和频域信息来增强遥感图像分割中的细节处理，特别是在边界区域和灰度变化区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分割中由于灰度变化（如阴影和低对比度区域）导致的语义边缘模糊问题，充分利用空间信息。

Method: 使用空间处理方法提取多尺度空间特征和细粒度语义细节，通过FFT整合全局和频域信息，利用Haar小波变换分解特征为高低频分量以优化边界分割。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID四个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FSDENet通过空间粒度和频域边缘敏感性的双域协同，显著提高了边界区域和灰度过渡区的分割精度。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Max-V1将自动驾驶重新概念化为广义语言，将轨迹规划任务建模为下一个路径点预测，通过单阶段端到端框架直接从摄像头输入预测轨迹，在nuScenes数据集上达到SOTA性能，提升超过30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自动驾驶重新概念化为语言建模问题，利用VLM的生成能力实现端到端的轨迹预测，避免传统方法的复杂性。

Method: 提出单阶段端到端框架Max-V1，将轨迹规划视为序列化的下一个路径点预测任务，采用基于统计建模的监督策略进行模仿学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，相比基线提升超过30%，在跨域数据集上表现出优异的泛化能力和跨车辆适应性。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更强大的自动驾驶代理奠定了基础，展示了基于语言建模的端到端方法在自动驾驶中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: 现有MLLM评估在单图指南理解方面探索不足，单图指南结合文本、图像和符号，体现人类感知特性，需要专门评估。

Method: 开发半自动标注流程，多智能体协作生成初步图像描述，辅助人工构建图像-文本对，构建OIG-Bench基准测试29个先进MLLM。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-72B表现最佳，总体准确率77%，但所有模型在语义理解和逻辑推理方面存在明显弱点，多智能体标注系统在图像描述方面优于所有MLLM。

Conclusion: 当前MLLM在准确解释复杂视觉-文本关系方面仍有困难，多智能体标注系统可作为高质量图像描述生成器和未来数据集构建工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

Motivation: 深度神经网络在视觉和机器人应用中广泛使用，但现有认证训练和鲁棒性认证方法面临过参数化问题，导致认证紧致性和可扩展性受限。需要解决语义变换扰动(如亮度和对比度)下的鲁棒性验证挑战。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Method: 提出基于密钥的参数扰动框架MOLM，使用二进制密钥激活残差和注意力块中的轻量级LoRA适配器，避免密钥特定的重新训练。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上的实验表明，MOLM在保持图像质量的同时，对失真、压缩、再生、平均攻击和黑盒对抗攻击具有鲁棒的密钥恢复能力。

Conclusion: MOLM框架实现了不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性等理想特性，为生成图像溯源提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

Motivation: 现有开放世界目标检测方法存在已知与未知类别间的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，导致未知类别召回率下降和已知类别精度退化。

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD-Discover（使用子模条件增益函数挖掘与已知对象显著不同的未知实例）和CROWD-Learn（使用组合目标联合解缠已知与未知表示，同时保持已知类别的判别一致性）。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，CROWD在M-OWODB和S-OWODB上分别将已知类别精度提高了2.83%和2.05%，未知召回率比领先基线提高了近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD通过组合式方法有效解决了开放世界检测中的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

Conclusion: 该基准和模型为开发真正适应真实世界第一人称感知挑战的轨迹预测系统提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing

risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under

generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of

solutions in critical applications such as meningioma RT planning. The code is

in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

*Wang Zhang,Huaqiu Li,Xiaowan Hu,Tao Jiang,Zikang Chen,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SCNet网络优化自监督去噪，通过频率控制解决高频细节丢失和噪声学习问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督去噪方法存在高频结构细节保留不足和网络学习高频噪声的问题

Method: 提出频率带选择策略、基于Lipschitz常数的参数优化方法、以及频谱分离和低秩重建模块

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了SCNet的有效性

Conclusion: SCNet通过频谱控制成功解决了自监督去噪中的高频细节保留和噪声学习问题

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

TL;DR: VLOD-TTA是一个用于视觉语言目标检测器的测试时自适应框架，通过IoU加权的熵目标和图像条件提示选择来提升在领域偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言目标检测器（如YOLO-World和Grounding DINO）在零样本识别方面表现优异，但在领域偏移下性能会显著下降，需要一种有效的测试时自适应方法。

Method: 1. 提出IoU加权的熵目标，专注于空间一致的提案簇，减少孤立框的确认偏差；2. 引入图像条件提示选择，根据图像级兼容性对提示进行排序，并将最有信息的提示与检测器逻辑融合。

Result: 在多种分布偏移（风格化域、驾驶场景、低光条件和常见损坏）下的基准测试表明，该方法在YOLO-World和Grounding DINO上均优于零样本和测试时自适应基线方法。

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA框架有效提升了视觉语言目标检测器在领域偏移下的性能，为实际应用提供了可靠的测试时自适应解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

Motivation: 当前视觉-语言模型在组合推理方面存在显著局限，需要建立一个统一的测试基准来评估模型在视觉感知、符号操作和算术一致性方面的能力。

Method: 构建包含140万个生成实例的基准测试，涵盖文本引导和纯视觉设置，系统性地考虑数字规模、移动复杂度、解决方案多样性和运算符变化。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的通用异常检测方法NAGL，利用正常和异常样本作为参考，通过残差挖掘和异常特征学习实现跨域异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用异常检测方法仅使用正常样本作为参考，忽略了现实场景中可获得的异常样本所包含的宝贵信息。

Method: 提出NAGL框架，包含残差挖掘(RM)和异常特征学习(AFL)两个关键组件。RM从正常-异常参考残差中提取异常模式，AFL通过残差映射自适应学习查询图像中的异常特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的通用异常检测方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在通用异常检测中采用正常和异常样本混合作为参考的工作，有效利用了两类参考信息实现更准确高效的跨域异常检测。

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了RAF（相对-绝对融合）特征提取技术，通过融合图像相对特征和数值绝对特征来增强基于图像的迭代方法选择，解决了传统方法中不同矩阵可能产生相同图像表示的问题，在稀疏线性系统求解中实现了5.86%-11.50%的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的迭代方法选择方法存在特征提取不足的问题，不同矩阵可能被编码为相同的图像表示，导致选择结果不准确和次优方法选择。

Method: RAF技术同时提取和融合图像表示作为相对特征，以及对应的数值作为绝对特征，形成全面的矩阵表示，避免不同矩阵间的特征模糊性。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和自建BMCMat数据集上的综合评估显示，RAF将稀疏线性系统的求解时间减少了0.08s-0.29s，比传统基于图像的选择方法快5.86%-11.50%，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RAF通过相对-绝对特征融合有效提升了基于图像的选择方法的准确性和性能，为稀疏线性系统求解提供了更可靠的迭代方法选择方案。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型的生成式手部姿态优化方法，利用从大型视觉语言模型推断的affordance感知文本描述来指导被遮挡手部区域的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手部被自身或物体严重遮挡时的3D手部姿态重建问题，受人类利用上下文知识（如affordance）解决模糊性的启发。

Method: 使用扩散生成模型学习在affordance描述条件下的合理手部姿态分布，通过VLM推断手-物体交互的affordance感知文本描述来指导优化。

Result: 在HOGraspNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最近的回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的扩散优化方法显著提高了手部姿态估计精度。

Conclusion: affordance引导的优化能够将遮挡区域重建为更准确且功能连贯的手部姿态，证明了上下文知识在手部姿态估计中的重要性。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

Motivation: 现有方法在压缩视觉token时忽视了压缩带来的特征空间扰动会增加模型学习难度，导致参数空间难以快速适应

Method: 通过分解token压缩引入的特征空间扰动，分别提出token一致性蒸馏和层一致性蒸馏，利用教师模型指导进行渐进学习

Result: 实验证明该框架具有优越的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: EPIC框架通过渐进一致性蒸馏有效解决了视觉token压缩带来的训练困难，提升了多模态大模型的效率

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图基础模型缺乏标准化评估基准，现有解决方案多在私有数据上评估，限制了可比性。超声心动图面临噪声采集、高帧冗余和公开数据集有限等独特挑战。

Method: 将8个公开数据集统一为标准套件，涵盖功能、结构、诊断和视图识别等任务。在一致的零样本、探测和对齐协议下评估多种基础模型。

Result: 不同模型家族展现出互补优势：时序建模对功能回归至关重要，检索在分布偏移下提供鲁棒性，领域特定文本编码器捕获生理学有意义的轴。通用编码器迁移能力强但难以处理细粒度区分。

Conclusion: CardioBench建立了可复现的参考点，为未来超声心动图基础模型设计提供可操作的见解。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性3D手部姿态重建模型难以处理自遮挡和复杂手部关节带来的姿态模糊性，而现有的概率方法仅限于单阶段估计且缺乏细化过程，无法产生准确的3D重建结果。

Method: 采用两阶段级联扩散框架：第一阶段使用联合扩散模型采样多样化的3D关节假设，第二阶段使用网格潜在扩散模型（Mesh LDM）在关节样本条件下重建3D手部网格。通过在学习的潜在空间中用多样化关节假设训练Mesh LDM，学习分布感知的关节-网格关系和鲁棒的手部先验。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能，同时有效建模了姿态分布。

Conclusion: 提出的级联扩散框架成功结合了概率建模与级联优化的优势，显著提升了3D手部姿态重建的准确性和对姿态不确定性的建模能力。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微生物学图像分析需要大量人工标注数据，过程耗时耗力。研究旨在证明现代视觉基础模型可以在极少标注数据下实现与传统方法相当的性能，从而降低自动化系统的开发门槛。

Method: 构建了5000张培养皿图像数据集，包含边界框标注和实例级掩码。在少样本和极低样本场景下，对三种视觉基础模型与传统基线模型进行基准测试，特别关注MaskDINO模型的表现。

Result: MaskDINO仅用150张图像微调即可达到与充分训练的YoloV9模型相近的性能，仅用25张图像仍能保持竞争力，在约70%的样本上表现可靠。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型能够以传统方法所需数据的一小部分实现相当性能，为自动化微生物系统提供了更快的开发周期和更高的性能上限。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

Conclusion: ASE方法通过自适应共享专家和细粒度专家设计，有效促进了单任务到多任务学习的过渡，提高了专家专业化和协作能力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Motivation: 现有的生成式视频帧插值方法只能合成固定数量的中间帧，缺乏调整生成帧率或序列总时长的灵活性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出TaRoPE位置编码支持任意时间戳插值，采用分段帧合成策略实现任意长度插值，并设计了外观-运动解耦的条件策略确保时空连续性。

Conclusion: ArbInterp框架成功解决了传统VFI方法的灵活性限制，为视频生成应用提供了更强大的插值能力。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

Abstract: Color representation is essential in computer vision and human-computer
interaction. There are multiple color models available. The choice of a
suitable color model is critical for various applications. This paper presents
a review of color models and spaces, analyzing their theoretical foundations,
computational properties, and practical applications. We explore traditional
models such as RGB, CMYK, and YUV, perceptually uniform spaces like CIELAB and
CIELUV, and fuzzy-based approaches as well. Additionally, we conduct a series
of experiments to evaluate color models from various perspectives, like device
dependency, chromatic consistency, and computational complexity. Our
experimental results reveal gaps in existing color models and show that the HS*
family is the most aligned with human perception. The review also identifies
key strengths and limitations of different models and outlines open challenges

processing, perceptual computing, digital media, and any other color-related
field.

### [42] [Multi-level Dynamic Style Transfer for NeRFs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00592)
*Zesheng Li,Shuaibo Li,Wei Ma,Jianwei Guo,Hongbin Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDS-NeRF是一种针对神经辐射场（NeRF）的多层级动态风格迁移方法，通过重新设计NeRF流程并引入动态风格注入模块，实现了更好的内容保持和艺术风格化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF风格迁移方法通常只是将风格统计信息集成到原始NeRF流程中，导致内容保持和艺术风格化效果都不理想。

Method: 提出多层级特征适配器生成多层级特征网格表示，动态风格注入模块学习提取相关风格特征并自适应集成到内容模式中，通过多层级级联解码器将风格化特征转换为最终风格化视图。

Result: 广泛实验证明MDS-NeRF在3D风格迁移方面表现出色，能够保持多尺度空间结构同时有效传递风格特征。

Conclusion: 该方法支持使用3D风格参考进行全视角风格迁移，为NeRF风格迁移提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

TL;DR: 提出了ADPT框架，利用大型视觉语言模型和语义模式匹配，通过迭代自我提问机制实现自动化结构缺陷标注，无需人工监督即可生成高质量标注数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施安全监测中手动标注成本高、效率低的问题，实现自动化结构缺陷标注。

Method: 集成大型视觉语言模型与语义模式匹配模块，采用优化领域特定提示和递归验证过程，通过迭代自我提问机制进行精炼。

Result: 在区分缺陷与非缺陷图像上达到98%准确率，在四个缺陷类别上获得85%-98%的标注准确率（类别平衡设置），在类别不平衡数据集上达到80%-92%准确率。

Conclusion: ADPT框架为高保真数据集构建提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，为结构损伤评估中的迁移学习和领域适应等下游任务提供有力支持。

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言导航中，前景提供语义线索，背景包含空间连接信息，但两者的重要性尚未充分探索

Method: 使用语义增强地标识别分离前景和背景特征，通过共识驱动的在线增强策略整合两阶段投票结果

Result: 在REVERIE和R2R数据集上提升了基线模型的泛化能力并达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 前景-背景特征在线增强策略能有效提升视觉语言导航的泛化性能

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOR提出了一种同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知的视觉识别方法，通过将定位作为识别的组成部分来解耦对象中心和上下文建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习会导致模型过度依赖背景信息（捷径学习），限制了模型在真实世界部署中的鲁棒性。现有方法主要通过抑制背景来解决这个问题，但牺牲了上下文信息。

Method: RCOR将定位作为识别的组成部分，解耦对象中心和上下文建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。该方法不需要微调即可在域内和域外背景数据集上提升性能。

Result: RCOR提高了监督模型和VLM在ImageNet-1k等复杂场景中的性能，证实了在复杂场景中先定位后识别的可行性。

Conclusion: RCOR是首个在不牺牲任何一方的情况下同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知的方法，为视觉识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用无条件判别器(UCD)来改进GAN训练，通过移除条件输入来避免冗余捷径，促进纳什均衡，在ImageNet-64上达到1.47 FID的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练是单步生成的关键，但GAN训练难以收敛且存在模式崩溃问题。研究发现条件判别器中的条件输入会创建冗余捷径，阻碍有意义的特征提取。

Method: 提出无条件判别器(UCD)，移除判别器中的条件注入，强制判别器提取更全面和鲁棒的特征，从而为生成器提供更好的监督。

Result: 在ImageNet-64数据集上达到1.47 FID，超越了StyleGAN-XL和其他SOTA单步扩散模型，证明了显著的性能提升和高效率。

Conclusion: 无条件判别器能有效促进GAN训练的纳什均衡，与经典GAN理论兼容，可以即插即用，实验验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法取得了优越的性能

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了几何先验和网络学习过程，为深度伪造检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Conclusion: ReFlux为评估整流流变换器中概念擦除的鲁棒性建立了可靠的基准，揭示了现有安全措施的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline

Conclusion: SpecMCD方法在不同云覆盖条件下具有优越性和潜力。

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

Result: AYT方法能显著加速CM训练，甚至超越LPIPS指标性能，并且能够在极小的批量大小下训练而不影响样本质量

Conclusion: AYT方法通过解决切线振荡问题，有效提升了一致性模型的训练效率和样本质量

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Conclusion: U2-rPCA方法成功解决了传统方法的局限，在保持数学可解释性的同时实现了更好的微血管成像性能。

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一几何和概率视角的框架，将扩散模型解释为向“好图像”流形的投影机制，并构建了新的确定性模型MPPM，在潜在空间中优于Latent Diffusion Model。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI方法往往忽视图像的几何结构，仅关注概率方法，且将潜在空间的概率分布视为无趣或预定义的。本文旨在统一几何和概率视角。

Method: 提出了几何框架和基于核的概率方法，将扩散模型解释为向图像流形的投影机制，构建了Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM)，在表示空间和潜在空间均可操作。

Result: Latent MPPM (LMPPM)在多个数据集上优于Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)，在图像恢复和生成方面取得了更优越的结果。

Conclusion: 该研究通过统一几何和概率视角，为扩散模型提供了新的解释框架，并开发出性能更优的确定性生成模型。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

*Aaron Kujawa,Thomas Booth,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用二进制编码替代one-hot编码来减少医学图像分割的计算和内存需求，但在108类全脑分割任务中，二进制编码方法的分割性能显著低于one-hot编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基于学习的方法使用one-hot编码，计算复杂度和内存需求随类别数量线性增长。本文旨在通过二进制编码方法将这些需求降低到对数级别。

Method: 提出了一系列二进制编码方法，包括普通二进制编码、纠错输出码(ECOCs)、类别加权、硬/软解码、类别到码字分配和标签嵌入树。

Result: 在108类全脑分割任务中，one-hot编码的DSC为82.4(2.8)，而二进制编码方法的DSC范围仅为39.3到73.8，性能显著降低。

Conclusion: 虽然二进制编码在极端分类问题中有效，但在大类别医学图像分割任务中难以达到最先进的性能。作者希望这项工作能激发未来对紧凑编码策略的研究。

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

*Jinchang Zhang,Zijun Li,Jiakai Lin,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种事件-图像知识蒸馏框架，利用CLIP的语义理解能力实现事件数据的开放词汇目标检测，通过混合SNN-CNN框架自适应确定事件分割时刻以保留关键时间信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机缺乏纹理和颜色信息，使得开放词汇检测特别困难。现有事件检测方法通常在预定义类别上训练，难以泛化到新物体。CLIP等视觉语言模型在RGB图像中实现了开放词汇检测，但模态差异使其无法直接应用于事件数据。

Method: 使用图像帧作为教师模型输入，通过基于空间注意力的知识蒸馏指导事件学生模型学习CLIP的丰富视觉表示。设计混合SNN-CNN框架，SNN自适应确定最优事件分割时刻，CNN处理提取的事件特征进行目标检测。

Result: 学生网络直接从原始事件输入学习有意义的视觉特征，同时继承了CLIP的广泛视觉知识。避免了固定分组事件分割方法导致的关键时间信息丢失问题。

Conclusion: 该框架成功弥合了事件数据与图像之间的模态差距，实现了事件数据的开放词汇目标检测，解决了事件相机在新物体检测中的泛化问题。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

TL;DR: 提出ProtoMask模型，使用图像分割基础模型来改进原型映射的真实性，通过将显著性图计算限制在预定义的语义图像块中来减少不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于原型的方法通常依赖额外的后处理显著性技术来解释学习到的原型语义，但这些技术的可靠性和质量受到质疑。

Method: 使用图像分割基础模型生成分割掩码，利用每个掩码的边界框裁剪图像，每个掩码作为ProtoMask新模型架构的独立输入。

Result: 在三个细粒度分类数据集上的实验表明，该模型具有竞争性能，并提供了独特的可解释性特征。

Conclusion: ProtoMask模型通过结合图像分割技术，提高了原型映射的真实性，为可解释AI提供了更可靠的可视化方法。

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

TL;DR: MoE-SGT是一个结合图变换器和专家混合模块的概念瓶颈模型增强框架，通过建模概念间的结构化关系来提升复杂概念推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)通常是单模态的，忽略了概念间的结构化关系，难以适应复杂的推理任务。

Method: 构建答案-概念和答案-问题图来建模概念关系，集成图变换器捕捉多层次依赖，并用专家混合模块替代前馈层实现动态专家分配。

Result: 在多个数据集上，MoE-SGT比其他概念瓶颈网络获得了更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过建模概念结构化关系和动态专家选择机制，MoE-SGT显著提升了模型对复杂概念推理的适应能力。

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多模态大语言模型内在不确定性的训练无关框架，通过响应熵来引导模型关注最相关的视觉信息，提升细粒度感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知任务（如高分辨率图像中的小物体检测、长视频中的关键时刻定位）上表现不佳，现有方法依赖复杂的任务特定微调，限制了泛化能力并增加了模型复杂度。

Method: 利用MLLM的内在不确定性作为主动引导信号，通过计算候选视觉输入的响应熵来评分，使模型能够自主聚焦于最显著的数据，无需额外训练。

Result: 在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时序定位三个复杂视觉任务上，该方法使现成的MLLM达到了与专门微调方法相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 利用内在不确定性是增强多模态细粒度性能的强大通用策略，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统配准方法速度慢且对采集变化敏感，限制了定量灌注成像的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用无监督深度学习管道，通过三步校正运动，采用鲁棒主成分分析减少对比度相关影响，对齐灌注序列和辅助图像。

Result: 显著改善时间强度曲线平滑度，心肌对齐效果与基线相当但优于未配准状态，灌注图运动减少，处理时间减少15倍。

Conclusion: 该深度学习管道实现了快速、鲁棒的运动校正，可促进定量灌注成像的临床推广应用。

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

TL;DR: 该研究探索使用DEAP数据集中部分EEG通道进行情绪预测，通过连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，训练视觉变换器模型，仅用12个通道就能实现91.57%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情绪预测方法如自我评估和面部表情分析存在主观性和模糊性问题，EEG提供更直接无偏的数据源。低成本EEG设备简化了测量过程，但需要验证其情绪预测的准确性。

Method: 使用连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，然后训练视觉变换器模型进行情绪分类，重点关注使用较少通道（12个）时的性能表现。

Result: 模型仅使用12个测量点（通道）就能在预测4个象限（高/低唤醒度和效价）时达到91.57%的准确率，相比使用32个通道的最先进结果96.9%仅有轻微下降。

Conclusion: 显著减少输入通道数量仍能获得高准确率，证明低成本EEG设备在情绪预测方面具有实用价值，为更广泛的应用提供了可能性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有盲图像恢复方法在处理极端退化图像时效果不佳，直接学习ELQ到HQ的映射因域差距过大而困难。

Method: 使用投影器将ELQ图像映射到中间LQ流形，然后使用冻结的现成BIR模型恢复。基于信息瓶颈理论设计训练目标。

Result: 在严重退化情况下进行广泛实验，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理极端盲图像恢复问题，支持即插即用增强现有模型，无需微调。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP解决了现有评估方法的局限性，新发布的EYE4ALL数据集为开发更易访问的AI系统提供了基础，特别是考虑了盲人和低视力用户的需求。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击需要多次查询或扩散模型来生成对抗样本，这限制了在现实场景中的应用，因此需要一种更高效的攻击方法

Method: 使用从DNN获取的特征图，将其添加到干净图像中以破坏目标模型的分类，实现单次查询的对抗攻击

Result: ZQBA能够将对抗样本迁移到不同模型和数据集（CIFAR和Tiny ImageNet），在单次查询下比现有黑盒攻击更有效，同时保持扰动的不可感知性

Conclusion: ZQBA方法揭示了在现实世界环境中使用DNN的脆弱性，提供了一种高效的黑盒对抗攻击方案

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

*Yifan Shen,Yangyang Shu,Hye-young Paik,Yulei Sui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MetaLogic评估框架，用于检测文本到图像模型在语义一致性方面的缺陷，无需真实图像作为参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在处理语义等效但语法不同的提示词时，生成的图像缺乏语义一致性，暴露了模型在推理和泛化方面的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 利用蜕变测试生成语义相同但语法不同的提示词对，通过直接比较生成的图像对来识别不一致性，从而诊断模型逻辑理解的鲁棒性问题。

Result: 评估多个先进T2I模型发现，即使是最先进的模型如Flux.dev和DALLE-3也分别有59%和71%的错位率，显示出严重的鲁棒性缺陷。

Conclusion: MetaLogic框架能够有效、可扩展地识别现有评估指标忽略的细粒度逻辑不一致问题，为模型调试和改进提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and
applicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and
building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment. Code is available at:

Motivation: 当前视频生成模型产生违反真实世界动力学的物理不一致运动，需要改进物理一致性。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用视觉语言模型预测粗粒度运动轨迹以保持物理一致性；2) 通过基于注意力的机制进行细粒度运动精炼。基于视频跟踪数据构建轨迹预测数据集。

Result: 在UCF-101和MSR-VTT数据集上优于现有方法，分别获得545和539的FVD分数。

Conclusion: TrajVLM-Gen通过物理感知的轨迹引导有效提升了视频生成的物理一致性和质量。

Abstract: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that
violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for
physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language
Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency
with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation
through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic
motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that
TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of
545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动音频描述生成方法主要关注几秒钟的剪辑片段，且通过与单一参考音频描述比较来评估，但音频描述写作具有主观性。需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 通过分析同一电影的两个独立音频描述轨道来量化主观性，并提出ADQA基准测试，包含视觉欣赏问题和叙事理解问题，评估音频描述在长视频片段中的效果。

Result: 发现当前音频描述生成方法在帮助用户理解故事和欣赏视觉细节方面远远落后于人工编写的音频描述。

Conclusion: 提出了未来工作的建议，并建立了公开排行榜用于基准测试。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

<details>

Motivation: 当前短语定位研究主要局限于单视图图像，忽略了立体视觉中丰富的几何线索。为了将短语定位扩展到立体领域，需要构建相应的数据集。

Method: 基于PhraseCut数据集，利用GenStereo从现有单视图数据生成准确的右视图图像，创建包含对齐分割掩码和短语标注的立体图像对。

Result: 构建了PhraseStereo数据集，为语言、视觉和3D感知交叉领域的研究奠定了基础，支持模型在语义和几何上的联合推理。

Conclusion: PhraseStereo数据集填补了立体视觉中短语定位的空白，为开发能够同时处理语义和几何信息的模型提供了重要资源，该数据集将在论文接受后公开发布。

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

*Xiangtao Kong,Rongyuan Wu,Shuaizheng Liu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NSARM框架，结合自回归模型和两阶段训练方法，在真实图像超分辨率任务中实现高质量输出和快速推理，同时提高对输入图像质量的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的Real-ISR方法存在速度慢或质量低的问题，且对输入图像退化程度敏感，缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 使用视觉自回归模型，采用两阶段训练：先训练转换网络生成初步尺度，再进行端到端全模型微调。

Result: NSARM在视觉质量上优于现有Real-ISR方法，推理速度快，且对输入图像质量具有更高鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: NSARM作为纯自回归模型，在真实图像超分辨率任务中实现了质量、速度和鲁棒性的平衡。

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

Motivation: 传统分类方法往往忽略不同层次类别间的内在关系，错失了重要的监督信号，因此需要开发能够显式建模类间关系和层次结构的方法。

Method: 提出了两种层次对比学习方法：G-HMLC使用高斯混合模型，A-HMLC使用注意力机制来捕获层次特定特征，模拟人类处理方式，显式建模类间关系和不平衡类别分布。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ModelNet40数据集上，该方法在线性评估中实现了最先进的性能，比现有的层次对比学习方法在准确率上提高了2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算机视觉及其他领域具有应用潜力，通过定量和定性结果验证了其有效性，能够实现所有层次级别的细粒度聚类。

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

Motivation: 探索生成世界模型是否能够替代传统视觉编码器范式，用于通用多模态理解任务，特别是研究世界模型先验转移到视觉语言模型中的能力。

Method: 重新利用视频扩散模型作为生成编码器，执行单步去噪操作，将得到的潜在表示作为视觉嵌入，构建名为Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA)的模型。

Result: WorldLMs能够捕获对下游理解有用的潜在表示，在空间推理任务中显著优于开源和专有基线，达到最先进或相当的性能水平。

Conclusion: 生成编码器继承了视频预训练的运动一致性内部化特性，为利用世界模型先验的新一代视觉语言模型开辟了有前景的道路。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合移位窗口自注意力和Mamba选择性扫描的混合架构GSMamba，用于视频超分辨率，通过Gather-Scatter Mamba机制解决遮挡伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于RNN的VSR方法存在梯度消失、缺乏并行性和推理速度慢的问题，而Transformer虽然能建模全局上下文但复杂度高且可扩展性有限。Mamba提供了线性时间复杂度的选择性状态空间模型，但单独使用时难以捕获细粒度空间依赖。

Method: 结合移位窗口自注意力进行空间上下文聚合和Mamba选择性扫描进行高效时间传播，引入Gather-Scatter Mamba机制，在Mamba传播前将特征向中心锚帧扭曲，传播后再散射回所有帧。

Result: 该方法有效减少了遮挡伪影，确保聚合信息在所有帧间的有效重新分布。

Conclusion: GSMamba混合架构成功结合了自注意力的空间建模能力和Mamba的高效时间传播，为视频超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

Motivation: 传统的3D OCT体积信息压缩到2D报告会导致关键结构细节丢失，需要一种能够保留3D结构信息并提高青光眼诊断准确性的方法。

Method: 使用混合深度学习模型，集成交叉注意力机制到3D CNN中，通过沿两个轴分割体积并应用交叉注意力来捕捉半视网膜区域间的不对称性，同时整合视神经头和黄斑信息。引入CAREs可视化交叉注意力输出，并与Grad-CAMs对齐进行多任务微调。

Result: 在两个大型数据集上的验证表明，该模型在所有关键指标上都优于最先进的注意力和卷积模型，计算效率高，参数数量减少100倍，同时保持高诊断性能和可比的GFLOPS。

Conclusion: AI-CNet3D模型通过解剖学指导的交叉注意力网络有效提升了青光眼分类性能，同时提高了可解释性和解剖学一致性，为OCT-based青光眼诊断提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

Motivation: 手动标注3D面部扫描的解剖标志点耗时且依赖专业知识，限制了临床应用的效率。现有深度学习方法多关注伪标志点或需要复杂输入表示，临床适用性有限。

Method: 结合粗对齐、感兴趣区域过滤和初始标志点近似，使用基于补丁的点卷积神经网络并增强注意力机制。

Result: 在214个健康成人标注扫描上达到3.686毫米平均定位误差，在FaceScape数据集的700个对象上达到0.41毫米点误差和0.38毫米距离误差，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAL-Net提供了一个轻量级、可扩展的高通量3D人体测量分析解决方案，有潜力支持临床工作流程并减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfVSR是一种用于长视频超分辨率的创新方法，通过自回归单步扩散范式实现流式推理，解决了现有方法在处理长序列时的效率和可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在处理长序列时面临两个主要挑战：多步去噪导致的效率低下，以及时间分解引起的伪影和不连续性。

Method: 将预训练的DiT调整为因果结构，通过滚动KV缓存和联合视觉指导保持局部和全局一致性；将扩散过程蒸馏为单步，使用补丁级像素监督和跨块分布匹配。

Result: 该方法在长视频超分辨率方面达到最先进质量，语义一致性增强，相比MGLD-VSR等方法速度提升高达58倍。

Conclusion: InfVSR突破了长视频超分辨率的限制，实现了高效可扩展的无边界长度视频处理，并建立了专门的长视频评估基准。

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JEPA-T是一个统一的多模态框架，通过联合嵌入预测Transformer将图像和文本编码为离散标记，结合交叉注意力和文本嵌入注入来增强融合效果，在ImageNet-1K上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代文本到图像生成中基于标记的架构在文本与视觉标记融合方面的挑战，旨在实现更好的条件生成效果。

Method: 使用联合嵌入预测Transformer编码图像和文本为离散标记，加入交叉注意力进行条件去噪，并在流匹配损失前注入原始文本嵌入以改善对齐。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K评估中，JEPA-T展现出强大的数据效率、开放词汇泛化能力，并持续优于非融合和后期融合基线方法。

Conclusion: 后期架构融合与目标级对齐的结合为基于标记的文本到图像生成提供了条件强度与骨干通用性之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastForward是一种单次前向传播的视觉定位方法，能够在极短时间内完成地图构建和查询图像定位，无需传统方法所需的长时间地图准备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法即使从已知相机姿态的映射图像开始，仍需要数小时到数分钟的地图构建时间，限制了系统的实用性。

Method: 将多个映射图像表示为3D空间中锚定的特征集合，利用这些特征预测查询图像与场景的对应关系，从而估计相机姿态。

Result: 结合图像检索技术，FastForward在最小地图准备时间下实现了最先进的定位精度，并能泛化到未见过的领域，包括大规模户外环境。

Conclusion: FastForward证明了在保持竞争力的定位精度的同时，能够显著减少地图构建时间，为实时视觉定位系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种即插即用的精炼模块，通过后预训练步骤联合优化自回归模型生成的所有视觉序列标记，增强视觉语言建模中的空间对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在视觉语言数据建模中存在空间视觉信号与序列依赖性的冲突，导致次优结果，需要改进空间对应关系的建模。

Method: 设计了一个后预训练的精炼模块，利用全局上下文和标记间的关系，在共享序列预测框架下联合优化所有生成的视觉序列标记。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了生成质量，增强了模型产生语义一致结果的能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的精炼模块有效缓解了序列生成中的错误累积问题，提升了视觉语言建模性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SoftCFG方法解决自回归图像生成中CFG的指导衰减和过度指导问题，通过不确定性加权扰动和步骤归一化提升图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中应用CFG时面临两个关键问题：指导衰减（条件-无条件差距随解码过程快速消失）和过度指导（强条件破坏视觉连贯性）

Method: SoftCFG：基于不确定性的推理方法，在所有token序列中分配自适应扰动；每个生成token贡献确定性加权指导；引入步骤归一化来限制SoftCFG的累积扰动

Result: SoftCFG显著改善了图像质量，在ImageNet 256上实现了自回归模型中最先进的FID分数

Conclusion: SoftCFG是一种无需训练、模型无关的方法，能够无缝集成到现有AR流程中，有效解决CFG在自回归模型中的应用问题

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

TL;DR: TextCAM是一个将CAM与视觉语言模型结合的解释框架，通过自然语言描述模型关注的视觉属性，提供更语义化的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAM及其变体虽然能突出显示影响预测的空间区域，但无法提供这些激活背后的语义洞察，限制了在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 结合CAM的空间定位能力和视觉语言模型的语义对齐，使用CLIP嵌入和线性判别分析获得通道级语义表示，并与CAM权重聚合生成文本描述。

Result: 在ImageNet、CLEVR和CUB数据集上的实验表明，TextCAM能产生忠实且可解释的推理，改善人类理解，检测虚假相关性，并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: TextCAM通过融合空间定位和语义描述，为深度视觉模型提供了更丰富和可解释的解释方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

TL;DR: ImageDoctor是一个统一的多方面文本到图像模型评估框架，通过四个维度评估图像质量并提供像素级缺陷热图，可作为密集奖励用于模型偏好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用单一标量量化生成图像质量，无法提供全面且可解释的图像质量反馈。

Method: 引入"观察-思考-预测"范式，首先定位潜在缺陷，然后生成推理，最后给出定量评分。基于视觉语言模型，通过监督微调和强化学习训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上与人类偏好高度一致，作为奖励模型使用时比标量奖励模型提升10%的生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageDoctor作为评估指标具有有效性，作为奖励模型能显著提升生成质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为AT-RA的新型高光谱对抗训练方法，通过数据增强和空间平滑性来保护光谱语义信息，显著提升了高光谱分类模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱分类模型对对抗攻击高度脆弱，现有方法依赖定制化设计且防御效果有限，需要引入更有效的对抗训练方法来解决高光谱数据特有的挑战。

Method: 采用对抗训练并结合数据增强技术，提出AT-RA方法，通过增加光谱信息多样性和确保空间平滑性来保护光谱语义信息。

Result: AT-RA方法将对抗鲁棒性提升了21.34%（对抗AutoAttack）和18.78%（对抗PGD-50），同时将良性准确率提高了2.68%。

Conclusion: AT-RA方法有效解决了高光谱数据对抗训练中的独特挑战，显著提升了模型的安全性和性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在人脸匿名化中实现了安全性、高质量和可逆性的良好平衡，为隐私保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新定义先前的伪离散方法，在one-hot空间中直接保持扩散特性，而不是依赖连续潜在空间中的扩散或掩码策略。

Method: 使用浮点编码的one-hot类数据作为扩散输入，引入时间步条件交叉熵损失，在扩散模型输出和原始one-hot标签之间建立桥梁。

Result: 在分类任务上相比基线实现更优性能，在图像描述任务上展现出优秀的文本生成能力。

Conclusion: ADD框架通过协同设计在判别性和生成性学习之间建立桥梁，每个组件都带来可衡量的增益。

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法存在语义关系预定义限制，且在大环境中序列化容易超出LLM上下文窗口，需要更通用、可扩展的场景表示方法。

Method: 构建分层图结构（楼层、房间、对象、功能元素），通过优化几何和视觉覆盖的关键帧选择，利用VLM提取场景信息，采用分层RAG管道进行上下文检索。

Result: 在四个基准测试（包括3D对象分割和复杂查询检索）中，KeySG在大多数指标上优于先前方法，展示了其语义丰富性和效率优势。

Conclusion: KeySG通过分层图表示和关键帧增强，有效解决了3D场景图的语义限制和可扩展性问题，为机器人推理和规划提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

*Jiahao Wang,Luoxin Ye,TaiMing Lu,Junfei Xiao,Jiahan Zhang,Yuxiang Guo,Xijun Liu,Rama Chellappa,Cheng Peng,Alan Yuille,Jieneng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoWorld是一个结合全景视频生成与演化3D记忆的世界模型，通过单张全景图像输入生成未来视频帧，利用演化3D重建作为空间引导来增强视觉真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类能够心理探索和重放3D环境的能力启发，旨在实现空间一致的长时程探索。

Method: 首先使用具有细粒度视图控制的视频生成器生成未来视频帧，然后通过前馈即插即用transformer演化场景的3D重建，最后基于演化3D记忆的几何重投影合成未来帧。

Result: 在合成户外环境、Habitat室内场景和真实世界场景的基准测试中，演化3D记忆显著提升了视觉保真度并保持了空间场景一致性。

Conclusion: EvoWorld代表了向长时程空间一致世界建模的重要进展，演化3D重建作为显式空间引导显著优于现有仅合成视频的方法。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMAGEdit是一个无需训练的框架，用于编辑视频中任意数量的目标主体外观，同时保持非目标区域不变，无需微调或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频编辑中多主体编辑的挑战，包括提示侧多模态条件不足和视频中掩码边界纠缠问题，扩展视频编辑的适用性。

Method: 通过提示引导的多模态对齐模块和基于先验的掩码重定向模块提供鲁棒的多模态条件和精确的掩码序列，利用大模型的理解和生成能力生成多主体多模态信息和掩码运动序列，然后将获得的先验掩码序列输入预训练的掩码驱动视频生成模型来合成编辑后的视频。

Result: 在新建的多主体基准MSVBench上的广泛实验验证，IMAGEdit始终超越最先进的方法，并与任何掩码驱动视频生成模型兼容，显著提高整体性能。

Conclusion: IMAGEdit通过强大的泛化能力解决了多主体视频编辑的关键挑战，显著扩展了视频编辑的适用性，且与现有掩码驱动视频生成模型兼容性良好。

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are

TL;DR: 提出Object-AVEdit方法，基于反演-再生范式实现对象级音视频编辑，通过开发词-发声对象对齐的音频生成模型和整体优化的编辑算法，在音视频对象级编辑任务中取得先进成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频后期制作和电影制作领域对音视频编辑有高需求，现有模型难以实现对象级的音视频操作，包括跨音视频模态的对象添加、替换和移除，同时保持编辑过程中源实例的结构信息。

Method: 基于反演-再生范式，开发词-发声对象对齐的音频生成模型，弥合音频与当前视频生成模型在对象可控性上的差距；提出整体优化的反演-再生编辑算法，确保反演过程中的信息保留和更好的再生效果。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在音视频对象级编辑任务中取得先进成果，具有精细的音视频语义对齐；开发的音频生成模型也表现出先进性能。

Conclusion: Object-AVEdit成功实现了对象级音视频编辑，在保持结构信息的同时实现了跨模态的对象级操作，为音视频编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: There is a high demand for audio-visual editing in video post-production and
the film making field. While numerous models have explored audio and video
editing, they struggle with object-level audio-visual operations. Specifically,
object-level audio-visual editing requires the ability to perform object
addition, replacement, and removal across both audio and visual modalities,
while preserving the structural information of the source instances during the
editing process. In this paper, we present \textbf{Object-AVEdit}, achieving
the object-level audio-visual editing based on the inversion-regeneration
paradigm. To achieve the object-level controllability during editing, we
develop a word-to-sounding-object well-aligned audio generation model, bridging
the gap in object-controllability between audio and current video generation
models. Meanwhile, to achieve the better structural information preservation
and object-level editing effect, we propose an inversion-regeneration
holistically-optimized editing algorithm, ensuring both information retention
during the inversion and better regeneration effect. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our editing model achieved advanced results in both
audio-video object-level editing tasks with fine audio-visual semantic
alignment. In addition, our developed audio generation model also achieved
advanced performance. More results on our project page:

Abstract: As autonomous systems move from prototypes to real deployments, the ability
of multiple agents to make decentralized, cooperative decisions becomes a core
requirement. This paper examines how agentic artificial intelligence, agents
that act independently, adaptively and proactively can improve task allocation
and coordination in multi-agent systems, with primary emphasis on drone
delivery and secondary relevance to warehouse automation. We formulate the

paradigm. Experiments are conducted in PettingZoo environment, where multiple
homogeneous drones or agents must self-organize to cover distinct targets

Conclusion: ToolBrain为研究人员和从业者提供了一个用户友好的框架，能够有效训练LLM智能体在特定领域使用工具，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to
autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements
(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at

Method: 采用训练自由的自适应推理抑制方法，通过多检查点确定性估计机制和渐进抑制阈值，动态抑制冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ARS实现了最高53%的token减少、46.1%的延迟减少和57.9%的能耗减少，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: ARS方法有效解决了推理模型的效率问题，在多个模型架构上都表现出优越的性能，为高效推理提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression

Motivation: 设计明智的AI政策是社会面临的重大挑战，但目前缺乏有效的科学共识形成机制。作者认为NeurIPS作为AI领域的领导者，应该承担起这一责任。

Method: 建议NeurIPS通过试点项目来催化科学共识，借鉴IPCC在气候政策共识形成方面的经验教训。

Result: 识别了当前AI政策共识形成机制的完全缺失，并论证了NeurIPS是最适合承担这一角色的平台。

Conclusion: NeurIPS应该在AI政策科学共识形成方面发挥领导作用，以制定更高质量的AI政策。

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的兴起，法律判决预测系统开始利用罪犯图像和文本案件报告，但这种方式可能带来意外后果和恶意使用风险，需要评估其有效性。

Method: 使用独立VLMs进行保释决策预测审计，设计干预算法：通过RAG管道引入法律先例，然后使用创新方案对VLMs进行微调。

Result: 发现模型在多个交叉群体中表现不佳，会错误地高置信度拒绝应获保释者；干预措施显著提升了保释预测性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来在实际部署VLMs进行法律判决预测之前设计更智能的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection in real-world scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the subtlety and dispersion of evidence across complex,
multi-year financial disclosures. In this work, we introduce a novel
multi-agent reasoning framework AuditAgent, enhanced with auditing domain
expertise, for fine-grained evidence chain localization in financial fraud
cases. Leveraging an expert-annotated dataset constructed from enforcement
documents and financial reports released by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, our approach integrates subject-level risk priors, a hybrid
retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to efficiently identify and
aggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall

reasoning and dataset construction for advancing robust financial fraud
detection in practical, real-world regulatory applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖安全工程师手工编码大量恢复规则，但无法预测现实世界中的各种意外情况，且很快变得不完整。

Method: 在Unreal Engine的模拟城市基准测试中，使用具身AI和大视觉语言模型，让无人机动态解释周围环境并决定紧急机动以实现安全着陆。

Result: 结果表明，具身AI使得一类新的自适应恢复和决策管道成为可能，这是以前手工设计无法实现的。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了自主空中系统的弹性和安全性，为无人机应急响应提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

*Anni Li,Aria Attar,Paul Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinkquel是一个经过微调的模型，用于生成可靠、可移植且经过执行验证的数据库查询。它结合了TS-SQL合成数据管道和TS-GRPO强化学习目标，在TS-SQL测试集上达到93.2%的执行成功率和61.8%的精确结果匹配率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言请求转换为可靠的生产级数据转换具有挑战性：正确性依赖于精确的模式链接和仓库特定的SQL方言，而训练期间最强的监督（执行成功和结果匹配）仅在序列级别提供。同时，组装大型执行验证语料库成本高昂，令牌级目标与这些全局信号不匹配，导致优化不稳定和可移植性有限。

Method: Thinkquel集成了新颖的合成数据管道TS-SQL，利用dbt作为可移植的中间表示，以及专门设计的Token-Sequence GRPO（TS-GRPO）强化学习目标，在微调LLMs时弥合令牌级训练信号和序列级执行奖励之间的差距。

Result: 在500个示例的TS-SQL测试集上，Thinkquel（32B）通过两阶段SFT课程达到93.2%的执行成功率和61.8%的精确结果匹配率，相比基础模型分别提高了67.2%（执行）和44.4%（匹配）。在Spider（14B）实验中，TS-GRPO提高了训练稳定性，并加速了执行匹配奖励相对于GRPO和GSPO的收敛。

Conclusion: Thinkquel通过结合TS-SQL合成数据管道和TS-GRPO强化学习目标，成功解决了自然语言到SQL转换中的关键挑战，显著提高了执行成功率和结果匹配精度，同时改善了训练稳定性和收敛速度。

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将工具调用任务分解为工具选择和参数生成两个子任务的方法，通过解耦微调创建专用LoRA适配器，并在推理时动态加载对应适配器来提升本地LLM的工具调用性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地LLM在工具调用场景中表现不佳，特别是在大型工具集选择和复杂参数结构生成方面，需要隐私保护且成本效益高的本地推理解决方案。

Method: 采用解耦微调方法，使用LoRA微调为工具选择和工具特定参数生成创建专用适配器，通过分离损失掩码处理两个子任务。DualTune推理框架动态加载相应LoRA适配器，并实施分层编排来限制工具选择数量。

Result: 在MCP-Bench基准测试中，使用解耦微调的Qwen-2.5-7B模型将基础模型的工具调用准确率提高了46%，在大多数情况下优于类似大小的其他模型，甚至优于2倍大小的模型。

Conclusion: 解耦微调和DualTune框架显著提升了本地LLM在工具调用任务中的性能，为隐私保护且成本效益高的本地代理编排提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

*Serena Gomez Wannaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICL引导虽然能提升特定任务性能，但会导致跨领域推理能力的"优化脆弱性"现象，在复杂推理问题上表现下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL引导对跨领域认知能力的影响，特别是推理能力在不同知识领域的变化。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS:20b模型的六个变体（一个基准模型和五个ICL配置），在840个测试中评估通用知识问题、逻辑谜题和数学奥赛题的表现。

Result: ICL模型在通用知识任务上达到91%-99%准确率，但在复杂推理问题上表现下降，谜题准确率降至10-43%（基准模型为43%），数学奥赛题无显著差异。

Conclusion: ICL引导在效率和推理灵活性之间存在系统性权衡，对LLM部署和AI安全具有重要影响。

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLM代理在工具选择中的偏见问题，发现模型会系统性地偏好某些提供商或列表中靠前的工具，并提出了轻量级缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理经常从市场中选择功能等效的工具，如果选择存在系统性偏见，会降低用户体验并扭曲竞争，因此需要评估和解决工具选择偏见问题。

Method: 构建包含多个功能等效工具的基准测试，测试7个模型，进行控制实验分析工具特征、元数据和预训练暴露的影响，并提出基于过滤和均匀采样的缓解方法。

Result: 发现语义对齐是选择的最强预测因素，扰动描述会显著改变选择，重复预训练暴露会放大偏见，提出的缓解方法能减少偏见同时保持良好任务覆盖。

Conclusion: 工具选择偏见是工具增强LLM公平部署的关键障碍，需要关注和解决。

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIA基准测试揭示了AI在对抗性高风险环境中的严重盲点：即使最先进的模型也无法在错误不可逆的对抗环境中有效运作，特别是在加密货币市场等存在主动欺骗的场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI评估基准主要在受控环境中测试任务完成能力，而现实世界部署需要AI具备对抗主动欺骗的韧性。加密货币市场2024年因漏洞损失300亿美元，是测试AI对抗性能力的理想场景。

Method: 在加密货币市场测试环境中，评估17个模型在178个时间锚定任务上的表现，要求AI区分真相与操纵、处理碎片化信息、在对抗压力下做出不可逆的金融决策。

Result: 无工具时前沿模型准确率仅28%，工具增强后提升至67.4%，但仍低于80%的人类基准。模型存在系统性工具选择灾难，偏好不可靠的网页搜索而非权威数据源。

Conclusion: 当前模型尽管在推理得分上表现优异，但在需要对抗主动反对的环境中仍存在根本性不足，对抗性鲁棒性是可信AI自主性的必要条件。

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

Motivation: Transformer在逻辑推理方面存在困难，可能源于缺乏对潜在空间和循环推理等创造性应用的探索。分层推理模型虽然取得了有希望的结果，但仍处于早期阶段，需要深入研究

Method: 对分层推理模型进行批判性回顾，检查关键设计选择，并提出改进变体

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme和Maze-Hard任务上取得了比之前报告显著更好的性能

Conclusion: 研究结果提出了令人惊讶的观察和进一步研究的有趣方向

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Motivation: 随着智能服务的发展，通信目标从人类转向AI代理，需要新的通信范式来实现实时感知、决策和协作。语义通信虽然前景广阔，但在动态环境和有限资源下的实际部署仍面临挑战。

Method: 1. 语义自适应传输：使用真实或生成样本进行微调，使模型适应不同环境；2. 语义轻量化传输：采用剪枝、量化和感知感知采样降低模型复杂度；3. 语义自进化控制：采用分布式分层决策优化多维资源，实现动态环境下的多代理协作。

Conclusion: 该语义驱动框架在AI代理通信网络中具有巨大潜力，能够有效应对动态环境和资源限制的挑战。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体基准测试面临新开发智能体快速达到性能天花板的问题，难以满足评估智能体能力的需求，需要一种能够持续提升测试难度的动态评估系统。

Method: TRACE框架包含三个阶段：进化提议挖掘（通过初步探索和发散思维提供任务进化提议）、问题形成与自由探索（将提议概念化为可行问题候选，智能体自由探索并记录执行轨迹）、多级验证（确保进化任务伴随可验证和可复现的轨迹）。

Result: 在GAIA基准测试上的实验表明，TRACE框架能够持续提升任务复杂度，同时通过可验证的执行轨迹提高正确性的可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从静态、手动策划的基准测试向动态、自我进化评估系统的范式转变，为智能体开发提供了可持续且具有挑战性的测试平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估AI回答患者健康问题的黄金标准——人类专家评审——劳动密集且缓慢，限制了可扩展性。自动化指标虽然前景广阔，但与人类判断的一致性不一且常常依赖上下文。

Method: 在100个患者案例中，收集了28个AI系统的回答（共2800个），并沿三个维度评估：是否回答问题、是否适当使用临床记录证据、是否使用一般医学知识。使用临床医生撰写的参考答案来锚定指标。

Result: 自动化排名与专家评分高度匹配，表明自动化评估可以可靠地扩展AI系统的比较评估。

Conclusion: 精心设计的自动化评估可以扩展AI系统的比较评估，并支持患者-临床医生沟通。

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS)方法，通过语义丰富的状态表示和动作掩码方案，构建可解释且鲁棒的球员级智能体模型，用于足球等入侵性团队运动的战术分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的分析方法直观但有限，现代机器学习模型往往进行模式匹配而缺乏明确的智能体表示。需要构建既能战术解释又能在异构数据源中鲁棒的球员级智能体模型。

Method: EDMS方法通过增强原始位置和速度数据，添加关系变量（如空间评分、传球和得分），并结合动作掩码方案，为持球和无球球员提供不同的决策集。

Result: EDMS与动作掩码相比基线方法，持续降低了动作预测损失和时间差分误差。定性案例研究和Q值可视化表明EDMS能突出高风险高回报的战术模式。

Conclusion: EDMS方法将学习到的价值函数和动作策略映射到人类可解释的战术概念，与比赛规则对齐，并展示了与多个商业和开源数据集的兼容性。

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

<details>

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在测试时扩展的可靠性通常使用奖励模型，传统认为过程奖励模型(PRM)优于结果奖励模型(ORM)，但这种观点主要基于数学相关领域。本研究旨在在多样化领域中对四种奖励模型变体进行统一评估。

Method: 在14个不同领域中统一评估四种奖励模型变体：判别式ORM和PRM(DisORM, DisPRM)以及生成式ORM和PRM(GenORM, GenPRM)。

Result: 与传统观点相反：(1)DisORM与DisPRM表现相当；(2)GenPRM不具竞争力；(3)GenORM是最稳健的，在所有测试领域中都获得显著且一致的提升。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了细粒度监督总是更好的普遍假设，支持在多领域部署中使用生成式结果验证。过程奖励模型的逐步评分会从LLM自动标注中继承标签噪声，并且在评估长推理轨迹时存在困难。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}

Motivation: 现有嵌入模型缺乏视觉交互能力，无法处理用户指定的感兴趣区域，限制了在局部定位和实体级信息学习方面的应用潜力。

Method: 结合分割模型处理视觉提示来定位图像中特定区域，使嵌入器能更精确处理复杂和模糊场景。

Result: 在36个通用MMEB任务上提升3.1%-8.5%，在5个视觉交互SCaR任务上提升15.2%-20.3%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: VIRTUE成功将分割模型和视觉语言模型的能力扩展到表示学习领域，为嵌入模型引入了视觉交互能力，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

Motivation: 当前数据质量框架主要针对静态数据集，无法充分应对RAG系统的动态多阶段特性，需要开发专门针对这类AI系统的数据质量维度。

Method: 通过对16家领先IT服务公司从业者进行半结构化访谈，通过定性内容分析归纳得出RAG系统的数据质量维度。

Result: 识别出15个不同的DQ维度，分布在RAG系统的四个处理阶段，发现新维度主要集中在早期阶段，且DQ问题会在管道中转化和传播。

Conclusion: 需要扩展传统DQ框架以覆盖RAG环境，采用前置质量管理策略，并建立动态、阶段感知的质量管理方法。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过并行迭代去噪生成令牌，虽然降低了延迟并支持双向条件化，但其推理机制带来的安全风险尚未被充分理解，特别是越狱攻击可能利用此机制。

Method: 研究发现如果在中间步骤出现对有害查询的肯定令牌，后续去噪过程可能被引导生成有害响应。基于此分析，提出了一种针对DLMs的安全对齐方法，训练模型从包含肯定令牌的污染中间状态生成安全响应。

Result: 实验表明所提方法能显著缓解该漏洞，对任务性能影响最小，同时提高了对传统越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了进行DLM特定安全研究的必要性，扩散语言模型的安全机制需要专门设计。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

TL;DR: ACON是一个统一的框架，通过优化压缩指南来压缩环境观察和交互历史，减少内存使用26-54%同时保持任务性能，并能蒸馏到更小的压缩器中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为智能体在动态环境中部署时，需要积累长历史记录，导致上下文长度增长，增加了成本并降低了长视野任务的效率。

Method: ACON利用自然语言空间中的压缩指南优化：当完整上下文成功但压缩上下文失败时，LLM分析失败原因并相应更新压缩指南，然后将优化的LLM压缩器蒸馏到更小模型中。

Result: 在AppWorld、OfficeBench和Multi-objective QA上的实验显示，ACON减少内存使用26-54%（峰值token），同时基本保持任务性能，蒸馏到更小压缩器时保持95%以上准确率，并将较小LM作为长视野智能体的性能提升达46%。

Conclusion: ACON有效解决了智能体任务中上下文长度增长的问题，通过优化压缩和蒸馏技术，在减少内存使用的同时保持了任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

### [124] [HARPA: A Testability-Driven, Literature-Grounded Framework for Research Ideation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00620)
*Rosni Vasu,Peter Jansen,Pao Siangliulue,Cristina Sarasua,Abraham Bernstein,Peter Clark,Bhavana Dalvi Mishra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA是一个AI驱动的科学发现系统，通过文献挖掘识别研究趋势、探索假设设计空间，并生成可测试的假设。相比基线AI，在可行性和基础性方面表现更优，并能从实验经验中学习改进假设评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化科学发现工具难以生成既可测试又基于科学文献的假设，且无法根据先前实验结果进行自适应调整。

Method: HARPA采用受人类研究人员启发的构思流程：文献挖掘识别研究趋势、探索假设设计空间、通过确定研究差距和论证设计选择来收敛到精确可测试的假设，并学习基于先前实验结果的奖励模型。

Result: HARPA生成的研究提案在可行性和基础性方面显著优于基线AI（分别提升0.78和0.85分），与ASD代理配合时成功率更高（20 vs 11），失败率更低（16 vs 21）。学习奖励模型后比未训练基线提升约28%。

Conclusion: HARPA的方法在AI驱动科学发现领域迈出了重要一步，能够生成更可行、更基础的假设，并能从经验中学习改进假设质量。

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 论文发现当前模型编辑方法存在根本性缺陷，其表面成功基于隐藏的捷径而非真实语义，在否定查询下会崩溃，挑战了模型编辑领域的可行性基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前模型编辑方法的脆弱性，这些方法看似可靠但实际上基于捷径而非真实语义理解，需要重新评估模型编辑的基础前提。

Method: 开发了一套新的评估方法，特别设计了否定查询等负例测试，系统性地检验模型编辑方法的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现最先进的模型编辑方法在简单的否定查询下就会崩溃，表明编辑可能基于捷径而非完整的语义理解。

Conclusion: 模型编辑领域需要重新考虑其基础前提，因为捷径与稳健的知识整合本质相悖，在进一步推进前必须解决这一根本问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

*Bingzhang Wang,Kehua Chen,Yinhai Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CDDM方法，通过协作渐进蒸馏技术将大型扩散模型压缩为轻量级模型，在保持高精度的同时实现161倍压缩和31倍加速，适用于自动驾驶和智能交通系统的实时轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在概率轨迹预测中表现出色，但模型规模大、采样速度慢，阻碍了实际部署。需要开发轻量高效的实时预测方法。

Method: 基于协作渐进蒸馏(CPD)，逐步将知识从大型教师扩散模型转移到轻量级学生模型，同时减少采样步数和模型规模，并引入双信号正则化蒸馏损失防止过拟合。

Result: 在ETH-UCY和nuScenes基准测试中达到最先进精度，仅需231K参数和2-4采样步数，保留96.2% ADE和95.5% FDE性能，实现161倍压缩、31倍加速和9ms延迟。

Conclusion: CDDM成功将高性能生成模型与实际部署约束结合，为自动驾驶和智能交通系统提供了资源高效的概率预测解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

*Alessio Devoto,Maximilian Jeblick,Simon Jégou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Expected Attention的训练免费KV缓存压缩方法，通过预测未来查询对KV对的关注度来估计其重要性，解决了注意力分数不可获取的实践限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的存储消耗是大语言模型推理效率的主要瓶颈，现有基于注意力分数的KV缓存剪枝方法面临未来注意力分数不可获取和现代实现中注意力矩阵不完整的问题。

Method: 利用LLM激活的分布特性，以闭式形式计算每个KV对的期望注意力分数，基于这些分数进行有原则的排序和剪枝，最小化对残差流的影响。

Result: 该方法在预填充和解码阶段都能无缝运行，在两个场景中都持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 开发了KVPress库，包含超过20种技术，为研究人员实现和基准测试KV缓存压缩方法提供支持。

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for
advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as
healthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper
introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch
implementation of the Grad-CAM algorithm with a prototypical reconstruction
loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,
thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results
demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and
image reconstruction quality while reducing training and inference times. By
ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a
relevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and
trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种迭代式相关区域(RZ)缩减方法，通过重复求解同一位置并逐步限制涉及区域，引导求解器找到更小的RZ，从而提升策略重用效率和剪枝效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏求解面临指数级增长的游戏树问题，虽然相关区域(RZ)技术能显著减少搜索空间，但不同解决方案会产生不同大小的RZ。较小的RZ更有利于重用和剪枝效率。

Method: 设计了三种约束生成策略，并整合了RZ模式表以充分利用过往解决方案，通过迭代求解逐步限制区域范围。

Result: 在7x7 Killall-Go实验中，平均RZ大小减少到原始的85.95%，缩减后的RZ可作为可重用知识存储。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减小RZ规模，提升求解效率，缩减后的RZ可作为永久知识库用于未来更大棋盘或不同开局位置的求解任务。

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

Motivation: 现有策略优化算法（如PPO）存在静态训练计划和刚性裁剪机制的限制，阻碍了大规模视觉语言模型在复杂推理任务中的对齐效果

Method: ACPO包含两个核心组件：1）动态课程学习，从近策略探索阶段平滑过渡到离策略利用阶段；2）优势感知自适应裁剪机制，根据每个token的归一化优势动态调整裁剪边界

Result: 在MathVista、LogicVista和MMMU-Pro等多模态推理基准测试中，ACPO持续超越DAPO和PAPO等强基线，实现最先进性能、加速收敛和优越的训练稳定性

Conclusion: ACPO通过自适应学习策略有效解决了现有策略优化算法的局限性，为视觉语言模型的强化学习对齐提供了更高效和稳定的解决方案

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

Method: 提出数据增强流水线：EvolAST(语法对称性)、EvolDomain(语义对称性)和EvolDifficulty(难度多样性)，使用这些方法生成训练数据来训练7B参数的EvolProver定理证明器。

Result: EvolProver在FormalMATH-Lite上达到53.8% pass@32，在MiniF2F-Test、Ineq-Comp-Seed和Ineq-Comp-Transformed上分别达到69.8%、52.2%和34.0% pass@32，均创下非推理模型的新记录。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据增强方法能有效提升定理证明模型的鲁棒性，EvolProver在多个基准测试中超越了同规模模型，包括推理模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: DDIM反演技术使恶意用户能轻松合成虚假或深度伪造内容，而现有防御方法在破坏扩散过程方面效果有限，存在目标与去噪轨迹不匹配的问题。

Method: 提出DDIM反演攻击(DIA)，直接攻击集成的DDIM轨迹路径，而非单个步骤，从而更有效地破坏图像编辑过程。

Result: DIA方法在各种编辑方法上都表现出有效的破坏性能，超越了之前的防御方法如AdvDM和Photoguard。

Conclusion: 该框架为行业和研究社区提供了实用的防御方法，能够有效对抗AI的恶意使用，代码已公开。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing
valuable insights into effective evaluation strategies.

Result: 证明在特定条件下两种方法可以生成相同的解释排序，某些蕴含概念在两个形式主义中等价表达

Conclusion: 两种方法在语义结构上存在等价关系，这一发现有助于促进基于成本的语义和c-representations的进一步发展

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

*Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督评估分类器的逻辑框架，通过分析分类器之间的一致性和分歧来推断其性能，无需真实标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当专家们意见一致时，我们无法排除任何可能的评估结果；但当他们意见分歧时，可以确定至少有一个是错误的。这种不对称性启发了无监督评估分类器的研究。

Method: 将分类器决策的一致性和分歧作为输入，构建线性规划问题，在整数空间中计算可能的正确或错误响应组合。使用逻辑约束和普遍适用的线性等式作为公理。

Result: 该方法能够构建无需知识的警报系统，检测LLM作为评判者是否违反用户设定的最低评分阈值。

Conclusion: 仅通过逻辑一致性进行无监督评估具有实际效用，能够有效监控分类器性能而无需真实标签信息。

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着分布式能源资源特别是可再生能源的集成增加，传统基于固定阈值的保护方案无法在动态条件下可靠识别和定位短路故障，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 使用电压和电流波形数据，分割成10-50毫秒的滑动窗口，在实时约束下评估经典机器学习模型在故障分类和故障定位任务中的性能。

Result: 最佳故障分类模型F1得分达0.992±0.001，最佳故障定位模型R2达0.806±0.008，平均处理时间为0.563毫秒。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在电力系统保护中表现出色，能够满足实时处理要求，为复杂电网条件下的故障检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币市场中拉高抛售操纵事件的稀缺性导致严重的类别不平衡问题，阻碍了准确的检测。

Method: 应用合成少数类过采样技术(SMOTE)，并评估先进的集成学习模型来区分操纵性交易行为和正常市场活动。

Result: SMOTE显著提高了所有模型检测P&D事件的能力，XGBoost和LightGBM分别达到94.87%和93.59%的召回率，具有强F1分数和快速计算性能。

Conclusion: 将数据平衡技术与集成方法相结合，显著改善了操纵活动的早期检测，有助于建立更公平、透明和稳定的加密货币市场。

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency
market.

Motivation: 大语言模型数量激增，但有效管理和利用这些资源仍面临挑战，需要学习模型能力的紧凑表示来支持下游任务。

Method: 受心理测量学中项目反应理论启发，将模型正确回答查询的概率建模为三个因素的函数：模型多技能能力向量、查询区分度向量和查询难度标量，使用混合专家网络联合学习这些参数。

Result: 在模型路由和基准精度预测任务上达到最先进性能，学习到的参数编码了关于模型能力和查询特征的有意义、可解释信息。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效学习大语言模型能力的紧凑表示，为模型管理和利用提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Conclusion: AIDE为自动化知识发现提供了可扩展的基础框架，未来可以集成更多模式提取策略和领域知识，是迈向全面自动化知识发现解决方案的重要一步。

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKG方法主要将不同模态对齐到共享空间，忽略了特定模态的独特贡献，在低资源设置下性能受限。

Method: 提出FusionAdapter框架，包含适配器模块实现各模态到未见关系的有效适应，以及融合策略在保留模态特定特征的同时整合多模态实体表示。

Result: 在两个基准MMKG数据集上的广泛实验表明，FusionAdapter相比最先进方法取得了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: 通过有效适应和融合来自不同模态的信息，FusionAdapter在最小监督下提高了对新关系的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DAIL（Discovered Adversarial Imitation Learning），这是第一个通过元学习发现的对抗模仿学习算法，使用LLM引导的进化框架自动发现奖励分配函数，在未见过的环境和策略优化算法中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗模仿学习（AIL）方法虽然有效，但通常被认为不稳定。现有研究主要关注密度比估计的改进，而奖励分配函数在影响训练动态和最终策略性能方面的作用被忽视。

Method: 采用LLM引导的进化框架，在奖励分配函数空间中进行高效探索，发现数据驱动的奖励分配函数，而不是依赖人工设计的基于散度最小化目标的函数。

Result: DAIL在未见过的环境和策略优化算法中表现出良好的泛化能力，超越了当前最先进的人工设计基线方法。

Conclusion: DAIL通过自动发现的奖励分配函数实现了更稳定的训练，为理解奖励分配函数在AIL稳定性中的作用提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is
publicly available: https://github.com/shshnkreddy/DAIL.

Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的分离方法生成的切割数量不足，因为模型对生成多样化子集的敏感性不够，需要改进切割生成能力。

Method: 1) 在图粗化过程中引入随机边选择替代贪心方法；2) 提出GraphCHiP算法，利用粗化历史识别RCIs和FCIs。

Result: 在随机生成的CVRP实例上，相比现有神经分离方法，我们的方法在减少对偶间隙方面更有效，并能发现有效的FCIs。

Conclusion: 通过测试时搜索增强训练模型性能是可行的，能够生成更多样化的有效不等式，提升CVRP问题的求解效果。

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

Conclusion: QUASAR显著提高了生成量子电路的语法和语义性能，证明了工具增强LLM在量子电路生成和优化中的有效性。

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

Conclusion: AFFR为罕见病的公平可信联邦诊断提供了实用路径，统一解决了数据稀缺、设备退出和隐私保护问题。

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request
specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated
narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is
accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between
forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries
and about 6,000 parts.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了特征流形的功能作用，支持了基于实体的推理模型，表明语言模型编码和转换结构化表示。

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了70多个不同架构的LLM在概念表示上与人类的对齐程度，发现指令微调和注意力头维度是影响对齐的关键因素，而多模态预训练和参数量影响有限。现有基准测试无法完全捕捉人类-AI对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的快速发展带来了多样的计算要素，但尚不清楚哪些要素对构建具有人类类似表示能力的模型最关键。现有基准测试不适合衡量人类与模型之间的表示对齐度。

Method: 使用认知科学中成熟的三元组相似性任务，基于THINGS数据库的概念，评估70多个不同计算要素的模型，比较人类和模型的概念表示。

Result: 经过指令微调且具有较大注意力头维度的模型与人类表示最对齐；多模态预训练和参数量对对齐度影响有限；现有基准测试（如MMLU）只能部分捕捉表示对齐度，无法完全解释对齐度方差。

Conclusion: 指令微调和注意力头维度是推进LLM成为人类概念表示模型的关键计算要素，同时指出了当前LLM评估中的基准测试缺口。

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings

### [151] [Activation-Deactivation: A General Framework for Robust Post-hoc Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01038)
*Akchunya Chanchal,David A. Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Activation-Deactivation (AD)前向传播范式，通过关闭模型中与遮挡输入特征对应的部分来消除遮挡对模型决策的影响，解决了传统黑盒解释方法因遮挡导致分布外图像的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒解释方法依赖遮挡输入部分生成突变体，导致分布外图像，影响解释质量，且需要领域知识选择合适的遮挡值。

Method: 引入ConvAD机制，可轻松添加到任何训练好的CNN中，实现AD范式，无需额外训练或微调。证明ConvAD不改变网络的决策过程。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型架构上的实验表明，AD解释相比遮挡方法在鲁棒性上提升高达62.5%，且无需领域知识。

Conclusion: ConvAD能够提取更鲁棒的解释，解决了传统遮挡方法的局限性，无需领域知识即可获得高质量解释。

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

### [152] [Typed Chain-of-Thought: A Curry-Howard Framework for Verifying LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01069)
*Elija Perrier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于Curry-Howard对应的理论框架，将CoT推理轨迹转化为形式化证明结构，以验证推理的忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CoT提示增强了LLM的推理能力，但生成的推理过程是否忠实仍然是一个开放性问题，影响模型的可解释性。

Method: 利用Curry-Howard对应关系，将非正式的自然语言推理步骤映射到形式化的类型化证明结构中，通过成功转换来验证计算忠实性。

Result: 成功将CoT轨迹转化为良好类型的证明，作为计算忠实性的可验证证书，超越了启发式可解释性，迈向形式验证。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种将可信的叙述性解释转化为可形式验证程序的方法，为构建更可靠和可信的AI系统提供了路径。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIRL方法利用LLM内部的安全信念，将高置信度的拒绝行为转化为自生成奖励信号，无需外部验证器即可实现有效对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏通用标准和可靠的内容验证器，确保LLM安全性面临挑战，难以获得有效的训练信号。

Method: 提出SIRL方法，利用模型内部的安全信念（高置信度拒绝有害请求时的低熵特征）作为自生成奖励信号，强化低熵拒绝行为。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上评估，SIRL对20+种越狱方法保持89%+的防御成功率，仅使用15,000个未标注提示即可超越资源密集型监督方法。

Conclusion: 有效对齐可以从模型内部产生，为无需大量人工监督的自主、鲁棒AI安全机制开辟了道路。

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

TL;DR: 提出一个双层人本生产规划框架，结合约束规划优化生产调度，使用MDP模型考虑工人偏好和公平性，通过CP+MCTS/RL方法同时提升运营效率和劳动力公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生产规划主要关注运营效率，但忽视了劳动力公平性和工人偏好等人本因素，需要开发能同时优化效率和公平性的综合规划系统。

Method: 第一层使用约束规划(CP)解决订单-产线分配问题，第二层使用马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)建模工人-产线分配，并比较贪婪分配、MCTS和RL三种求解策略。

Result: CP调度产生紧凑可行的生产计划且延迟低，MDP工人分配显著改善公平性和偏好匹配度，领域专家评价系统有效，建议进一步优化目标函数。

Conclusion: CP与学习决策结合为人本生产规划提供了稳健方法，能同时优化吞吐量和劳动力福祉，为工业制造提供公平高效调度基础。

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PRISM-Consult是一个临床医生对齐的专家小组架构，将紧凑的PRISM序列模型扩展为路由的领域专家家族，通过轻量级路由器将急诊病例分派到不同专科模型，实现参数效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个安全、可审计、低延迟的临床咨询系统，通过专家小组架构提高急诊科病例处理的效率和准确性，避免常见事件主导结果。

Method: 使用结构化临床事件标记化，轻量级路由器读取前几个标记并分派到专科模型（心脏血管、肺、胃肠、肌肉骨骼、心理源性），每个专科继承PRISM的小型transformer骨干和标记模板。

Result: 在真实世界急诊科队列中，专科模型在各领域表现出平滑收敛和低开发困惑度，路由器在安全优先策略下实现高质量路由和大量计算节省。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模安全、可审计、低延迟咨询提供了实用路径，并概述了外部/时间复制、不对称生命威胁阈值和多标签仲裁等验证步骤，以满足前瞻性临床部署标准。

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的代理框架，利用网络与知识图谱的二元性进行供应链风险分析，通过图遍历和上下文模板生成可解释的风险叙述


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法简化了复杂关系，专业模型成本高且静态，无法处理金融风险中的多模态网络数据

Method: 将供应链网络视为知识图谱，使用网络中心性指导图遍历提取关键风险路径，结合数值因子表和新闻流，通过上下文模板使定量数据对LLM可理解

Result: 无需微调或专用图数据库，即可实时生成简洁、可解释且上下文丰富的风险叙述

Conclusion: 该轻量级方法有效解决了LLM处理复杂金融风险数据的挑战，实现了实时风险分析

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在证明通过精心设计的训练方法而非单纯扩大规模，可以在有限计算资源下实现前沿水平的多模态推理能力。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进方法：1)深度扩展推理能力；2)分阶段持续预训练，包括基础文本视觉理解和针对性合成数据增强；3)高质量文本监督微调。

Result: 在Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index上获得52分，与DeepSeek-R1-0528相当；在十个图像基准测试中平均性能接近Gemini-2.5-Flash和Claude Sonnet-3.7。

Conclusion: 证明通过深思熟虑的中期训练设计可以在不依赖大规模计算的情况下缩小能力差距，使前沿多模态推理对资源有限的组织变得可及。

Abstract: We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights
multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through
training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a
progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning
capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training
that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances
visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial
structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3)
high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response
pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and
tool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement
learning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our
data-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis
Intelligence Index, Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker attains a score of 52, matching
DeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
Across ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points
of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, a key achievement for a model
operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate
that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps
without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to
organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all
training recipes, and evaluation protocols under the MIT license to to advance
open-source research.

TL;DR: Bridge方法通过将批处理LLM隐藏状态视为整体张量而非独立切片，实现并行生成相互依赖的响应，仅需少量新参数即可显著提升响应质量和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统并行LLM推理中，N个响应独立生成，计算资源被分割，一个生成中的有用信息无法被其他生成利用，这与响应长度扩展中过去计算用于所有未来步骤形成对比。

Method: 重新思考批处理LLM隐藏状态为整体张量而非独立切片，仅添加少量新参数（2.8%-5.1%），使并行响应相互依赖。

Result: Bridge将可验证奖励强化学习的相对平均准确率提升高达50%，并提高了正确响应的一致性。一次训练即可扩展到任何生成宽度，性能始终优于独立生成。

Conclusion: Bridge解锁了一种更通用的并行扩展模式，有效利用序列间信息，兼容任何后生成聚合技术。

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估缺乏系统化方法来确保测试问题充分覆盖知识库，导致开发者存在盲点，需要量化测试问题的语义覆盖率。

Method: 将文档块和测试问题嵌入统一向量空间，计算多种覆盖率指标（基础邻近度、内容加权覆盖率、多主题问题覆盖率），并集成异常检测来过滤无关问题。

Result: 两个不同用例的实验证明，该框架能有效量化测试覆盖率，识别代表性不足的内容区域，并为生成新的高价值测试问题提供具体建议。

Conclusion: 为RAG开发者提供了构建更稳健测试套件的关键工具，提高了系统可靠性，并可扩展到识别未对齐文档等应用场景。

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate
representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,
high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential
tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability
and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

Motivation: 当前最先进的机器学习原子间势能模型通过等变神经网络架构强制旋转平移对称性，这种硬编码的归纳偏置往往导致灵活性、计算效率和可扩展性降低。

Method: 提出TransIP训练范式，引导通用的非等变Transformer模型通过在嵌入空间优化表示来学习SO(3)等变性，无需显式架构约束。

Result: 在OMol25分子数据集上，TransIP在机器学习力场方面达到与最先进等变基线相当的性能，相比数据增强基线在不同数据集规模下性能提升40%到60%。

Conclusion: 学习等变性可以成为等变或基于数据增强的MLIP模型的有力且高效替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文窗口对于处理长距离依赖任务至关重要。RoPE插值方法和后训练量化分别解决了上下文扩展和部署实用性问题，但两者结合时会出现精度显著下降。

Method: 提出了Q-ROAR方法：将RoPE维度分组为少量频带，对Key和Query权重进行轻量级的逐频带尺度搜索，使用插值压力和尾膨胀比作为诊断指标，无需微调或架构修改。

Result: Q-ROAR在长上下文任务上使模型困惑度降低超过14%，同时保持短上下文性能、推理吞吐量和现有LLM系统栈的兼容性。

Conclusion: Q-ROAR有效解决了RoPE插值与量化结合时的精度下降问题，提供了一种无需额外部署开销的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on
long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context
performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有健康基准要么过于通用，要么面向临床医生，缺乏专门针对糖尿病患者日常管理决策的评估框架。

Method: 收集15,000名糖尿病患者一个月的连续血糖监测数据和行为日志，生成36万多个个性化问题，评估8个LLM在7类任务上的5个指标表现。

Result: 不同模型在不同任务和指标上表现差异显著，没有单一模型在所有维度上都表现最优。

Conclusion: 该基准旨在提升AI解决方案在糖尿病护理中的可靠性、安全性和实用性。

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法使用欧几里得度量无法有效捕捉层次化数据的离散分支特性，需要更适合处理层次结构的新度量方法。

Method: 建立p-adic度量空间的数学理论基础，证明最小化p-adic距离的n维平面必须通过至少n+1个数据点，并与欧几里得回归形成对比。

Result: 主要理论结果证明：最小化p-adic距离和的n维平面必须通过至少n+1个数据点，这一特性与层次化数据的离散性质高度一致。

Conclusion: p-adic度量可能是处理机器学习中层次化数据结构的基础工具，在层次化数据中选择实际观测点作为代表比插值更有意义。

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

TL;DR: FedLLM-Align：利用预训练大语言模型作为通用特征提取器的联邦学习框架，解决表格数据异构性问题，无需手动模式对齐，在隐私保护和通信效率方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私敏感领域应用广泛，但表格数据的异构性（模式差异和特征空间不兼容）阻碍了直接聚合，需要解决这一挑战。

Method: 将表格记录序列化为文本，使用DistilBERT、ALBERT、RoBERTa和ClinicalBERT等预训练LLM生成语义对齐的嵌入表示，在标准FedAvg协议下支持轻量级本地分类器。

Result: 在冠心病预测任务中，所有客户端设置和LLM骨干网络下均优于现有基线方法，F1分数提升最高达+0.25，通信成本降低65%，在极端模式差异下仍能保持稳定性能。

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align为异构环境下的联邦学习提供了鲁棒、隐私保护和通信高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

Conclusion: 近似单峰似然模型能够更好地适应真实世界序数数据的分布特性，在保持单峰模型优势的同时缓解了对非单峰分布的偏差问题。

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text
corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization;
Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific
datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by
fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates
100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on
par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching
MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning
capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe
scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational
model.

Method: 1) 用脉冲自注意力(SSA)替换自注意力机制；2) 将训练好的transformer前馈块转换为等效SNN；3) 使用SNN代理学习算法微调SSA块

Result: GPT-2小模型转换后余弦相似度损失5-12%，困惑度降低9.7%。SSA块相比ASA块能耗降低64.71%-85.28%。

Conclusion: NeurTransformer方法成功实现了transformer模型向SNN的高效转换，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了能效，为大规模transformer模型的节能部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption
when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

Motivation: 人类通过比较不同观察来学习概念，这种认知机制对机器概念学习也很重要，可以为概念学习领域提供正确性保证，弥补现有经验成功但缺乏理论支持的不足。

Method: 开发了一个多类别观察下概念可识别性的理论框架，利用类别间的充分多样性来识别隐藏概念，即使条件不全局满足也能基于局部比较提供替代保证。

Result: 理论结果表明，在类别多样性足够的情况下，隐藏概念可以被识别，且类别与概念之间的隐藏结构也可以非参数地识别。在合成和真实场景中都验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 比较认知机制为机器概念学习提供了理论基础，扩展了概念识别理论在更灵活场景下的适用性，为非参数概念学习提供了理论支持。

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在有限反馈环境下强化学习的奖励选择问题（RLLF），探索了如何选择最有影响力的样本来标注奖励，以最大化策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实问题中，获取大量奖励标签通常不可行，特别是在依赖人类反馈时。当强化学习必须在有限反馈下进行时，需要确定哪些样本应该被标注奖励才能最大化策略性能。

Method: 提出了RLLF问题框架，研究两种选择策略：(i) 依赖无奖励信息的启发式方法（如状态访问和部分价值函数），(ii) 使用辅助评估反馈预训练的策略。

Result: 发现关键的奖励子集是那些能够引导智能体沿最优轨迹前进，并在偏离后支持恢复接近最优行为的奖励。有效的选择方法能够用比完全监督少得多的奖励标签获得接近最优的策略。

Conclusion: 奖励选择是在反馈受限环境中扩展强化学习的有力范式，能够显著减少所需的奖励标签数量。

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

Motivation: AI决策系统在关键领域的广泛应用引发了算法公平性担忧。由于通常只能访问算法输出而无法了解内部机制，研究社区提出了反事实公平性度量，但如何从可用数据评估这些度量仍具挑战性，因为目标反事实度量往往不可识别。

Method: 采用部分识别方法，从观测数据中推导反事实公平性度量的信息边界。引入贝叶斯方法，以高置信度约束未知的反事实公平性度量。

Result: 在COMPAS数据集上的实验显示，将种族改为非裔美国人会对COMPAS分数产生正向（伪）效应，而从年轻到老年的转变则产生负向（直接因果）效应。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理反事实公平性度量的不可识别性问题，为评估算法公平性提供了实用的工具，特别是在只能访问观测数据的情况下。

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative
(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

Conclusion: 通过逆向工程揭示了Transformer学习长程依赖的陷阱，并展示了正确归纳偏差如何解决这一问题，为改进模型学习能力提供了见解。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA通过结构化剪枝实现了灵活自适应的秩分配，提供了第一个结构化剪枝鲁棒性的理论分析，证明基于梯度的剪枝比基于激活的剪枝在权重扰动下更鲁棒。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

Conclusion: GRPO-λ通过改进信用分配机制，显著提升了RL微调LLM在复杂推理任务中的效果，为后训练方法提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA微调系统存在两个关键低效问题：一是由于大型激活张量的冗余内存访问导致运行时开销大；二是无法在相同GPU上并发微调多个共享基础模型的独立LoRA适配器，错失了减少流水线气泡、改善通信重叠和GPU负载平衡等性能增益机会。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly
reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality
on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies
in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to
Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over
mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel
achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance
improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing
LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Directed-MAML算法，通过任务导向的一阶近似来加速MAML在元强化学习中的收敛速度并降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAML在元强化学习中面临二阶梯度计算带来的计算和内存开销问题，以及嵌套优化结构导致的收敛困难

Method: 在二阶梯度步骤之前应用额外的任务导向一阶近似来估计二阶梯度效果，从而加速收敛

Result: 在CartPole-v1、LunarLander-v2和双车交叉路口场景中，Directed-MAML在计算效率和收敛速度上优于MAML基线

Conclusion: 任务导向近似可有效集成到其他元学习算法中，提高计算效率和收敛速度

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thoughtbubbles是一种transformer变体，通过在潜在空间中学习分叉或删除残差流来执行并行自适应计算，使需要大量计算的token能够在网络中间形成'气泡'进行额外思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于显式思维链token的方法存在局限性：无法在预训练期间应用，且仅限于串行生成的自然语言表达来扩展推理时计算。

Method: 提出Thoughtbubbles方法，在预训练期间仅使用语言建模损失学习在潜在空间中进行并行自适应计算，通过分叉或删除残差流让token形成'气泡'进行额外计算。

Result: 在OpenWebText和peS2o困惑度以及HellaSwag和LAMBADA等零样本评估中，Thoughtbubbles在1.5亿到7.72亿参数规模上都优于标准解码器语言模型和非自适应并行计算方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了从预训练开始学习自适应计算，为统一训练和测试时推理模型行为铺平了道路。

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

TL;DR: KV缓存压缩虽然能提高吞吐量，但在多指令提示等实际场景中可能导致某些指令被完全忽略，特别是系统提示泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究KV缓存压缩在实际多指令场景中的影响，识别部署压缩LLM时需要注意的陷阱。

Method: 分析不同压缩方法、指令顺序和KV驱逐偏置对提示泄露的影响，并提出改进的KV缓存驱逐策略。

Result: 发现某些指令在压缩时性能急剧下降，系统提示泄露问题突出，改进的驱逐策略能减轻这些影响。

Conclusion: KV缓存压缩需要谨慎部署，改进的驱逐策略可以提升多指令任务的整体性能。

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习虽然能够从高维时空流数据中提取物理洞察，但在潜在空间中实现可解释性仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 基于神经算子构建确定性自编码框架，通过编码神经算子进行空间粗化压缩到低维潜在空间，再通过解码神经算子进行空间细化重建。在潜在空间中集成可微PDE求解器，嵌入物理先验。

Result: 在2D圆柱绕流、2D对称狭窄动脉流动和3D患者特异性冠状动脉等基准问题上验证了DIANO能够在实现维度和几何降维的同时保持潜在可解释性。

Conclusion: DIANO展示了在潜在空间中求解PDE的能力，该空间既支持维度和几何降维，又允许潜在可解释性。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在自动微分框架中高效计算梯度统计信息的方法，通过AD图手术实现几乎零开销的梯度统计计算，并重新审视了优化中的非线性操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习训练算法将小批量样本视为单一对象，仅计算梯度平均值，而忽略其他梯度统计信息。本文旨在证明计算这些统计信息在AD框架中并非资源密集型任务。

Method: 通过自动微分图手术实现梯度统计计算，在某些情况下几乎无计算和内存开销。对于transformer等模型，使用JAX的向量化变换进行实现。研究了signSGD和Adam预处理器在单样本梯度变换下的表现。

Result: 发现signSGD中符号操作在梯度处理链中的最佳位置对成功至关重要，可通过信噪比预测。Adam预处理器在优化中最好由梯度分布的均值而非方差主导，与传统认知相反。

Conclusion: 单样本梯度信息为算法设计提供了新的分析和可能性，能够实现更高效的优化算法设计。

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

*Xiaofeng Lin,Hejian Sang,Zhipeng Wang,Xuezhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了监督微调(SFT)泛化能力不如强化学习(RL)的传统观点，通过系统评估发现SFT的泛化失败主要源于固定提示模板的缺陷，引入提示多样性和思维链监督可以显著提升SFT的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估SFT与RL在泛化能力上的差异，挑战SFT会记忆训练数据而无法泛化的普遍观点。

Method: 在两个决策基准(Sokoban和General Points)上系统评估，引入提示多样性训练和思维链监督作为算法支架。

Result: 提示多样性打破了训练语义的依赖，思维链监督显著改善了向更难任务的迁移，两者结合在指令变体和难度变体设置中都实现了强大的泛化，匹配或超越了RL基线。

Conclusion: SFT并非天生劣于RL，通过适当策划的演示数据，标准SFT可以实现与RL同样强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training
data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains
broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing
the results in the paper can be found at:

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于奖励的策略来自动优化变分自编码器（VAE）工作流程，使用高斯混合模型（GMM）和贝叶斯高斯混合模型（BGMM）来评估潜在空间表示的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显微镜技术产生大量复杂图像数据，需要发现更简单、可解释且简约的形式来揭示底层物理结构。VAE能构建低维表示，但其性能依赖于多个设计选择，通常通过试错和实证分析来优化。

Method: 使用压电响应力显微镜数据作为模型系统，研究多种策略和奖励函数来评估潜在空间表示。通过GMM和BGMM近似潜在空间来构建奖励函数。

Result: 分析表明，使用GMM和BGMM近似潜在空间能够构建有效的奖励函数，可以估计模型效率并指导寻找最优简约表示。

Conclusion: 基于奖励的策略为VAE工作流程的自动化和无偏优化提供了可行方法，GMM和BGMM是构建有效奖励函数的坚实基础。

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

Motivation: 受编码计算范式启发，将其应用于机器学习中，设计高效的正则化机制来鼓励更平滑的表征和更泛化的解决方案。

Method: 设计编码平滑模块，可集成到监督和无监督训练流程中，通过处理数据的线性组合来正则化学习，也可在推理时随机化模型增强对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 在监督和无监督任务上的大量实验表明，编码平滑能持续提升泛化能力，并在基于梯度的对抗攻击下达到最先进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 编码平滑模块是一种有效的正则化方法，能显著提升模型的泛化能力和对抗鲁棒性，且计算开销小。

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 现有研究发现循环网络擅长状态跟踪但难以处理回忆任务，而Transformer擅长回忆但无法将状态跟踪能力扩展到更长序列。受这两种架构互补优势的启发，研究者希望构建混合模型来同时保留两种能力。

Method: 构建集成循环和注意力组件的混合模型，并提出延迟注意力层训练的策略来防止Transformer组件过度依赖捷径解决方案。

Result: 实验表明，延迟注意力层训练的方法使混合模型在比训练序列长三倍的混合序列上达到接近完美的准确率（>90%）。

Conclusion: Transformer组件对捷径解决方案的依赖是混合模型长度泛化的主要障碍，通过延迟注意力层训练可以显著改善这一问题，使混合模型能够有效结合循环网络和Transformer的优势。

Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem
involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that
recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas
Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to
longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these
architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and
attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于能量的变分潜在先验（EVaLP）方法，通过将先验建模为能量模型来解决VAE生成模糊样本的问题，同时避免了传统EBM采样慢的缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决变分自编码器（VAE）中存在的"先验空洞"问题，即先验分布中高概率区域在后验分布中概率较低，导致生成样本质量差。

Method: 将先验建模为能量模型（EBM），采用变分方法处理EBM的归一化常数，避免昂贵的MCMC采样，使用采样器网络近似变分形式，并通过交替优化训练先验。

Result: 与多个SOTA基线相比，EVaLP在图像生成质量、减少先验空洞和采样效率方面均有改进。

Conclusion: EVaLP方法能够有效解决VAE的先验空洞问题，同时保持高效的采样速度，在生成质量上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于逻辑规则的方法通常将规则视为通用的，为每个规则分配固定的置信度分数，忽略了查询特定的上下文。这是一个重要限制，因为规则的重要性可能因查询而异。

Method: 提出SLogic框架，其核心是一个评分函数，利用查询头实体周围的子图信息，动态评估每个规则的重要性，为逻辑规则分配查询相关的分数。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，通过利用局部子图上下文，SLogic在知识图谱补全任务上始终优于最先进的基线方法，包括基于嵌入和基于规则的方法。

Conclusion: SLogic通过引入查询相关的规则评分机制，有效解决了传统逻辑规则方法忽略查询上下文的问题，显著提升了知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including
both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

Conclusion: Freedave算法成功解决了扩散大语言模型推理效率低的问题，实现了无损的并行解码加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Result: 研究发现促进静态泛化的特性（如低秩表示和简单性偏置）在持续学习场景中会直接导致塑性损失，并通过数值模拟验证了理论分析。

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了泛化与塑性之间的基本张力，并探讨了架构选择或针对性扰动作为潜在的缓解策略。

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary
environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the
degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a
first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in
dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable
manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis
reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from
activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational
redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore
architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation
strategies.

*Zhongxuan Liu,Yue Kang,Thomas C. M. Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了具有随机延迟反馈的Lipschitz赌博机问题，针对有界和无界延迟分别提出了算法，在有界延迟下保持了延迟无关设置的最优性能，在无界延迟下提出了近乎最优的算法。


<details>

Motivation: 传统的Lipschitz赌博机问题假设奖励立即反馈，但在实际应用中反馈往往存在随机延迟。本文旨在解决具有随机延迟反馈的Lipschitz赌博机问题。

Method: 对于有界延迟，提出了延迟感知的缩放算法；对于无界延迟，设计了基于阶段学习策略的新算法，通过精心安排的间隔积累可靠反馈。

Result: 在有界延迟下，算法保持了延迟无关设置的最优性能，仅增加了与最大延迟相关的额外项；在无界延迟下，算法达到了近乎最优的遗憾界（最多相差对数因子）。

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法能有效处理具有随机延迟反馈的Lipschitz赌博机问题，实验结果表明在各种延迟场景下都具有良好的性能。

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

TL;DR: DiSC-AMC是一种高效的自动调制分类方法，通过离散化统计特征、精简上下文和优化提示模板，在减少计算资源的同时保持较高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统LLM在自动调制分类中存在的长提示上下文和大模型尺寸问题，使其更适合实际部署应用。

Method: 使用离散化高阶统计量、轻量级预过滤器筛选示例、基于先前LLM响应的特征过滤，以及校准的仅标签预测提示模板。

Result: 在10种调制类型的合成AMC任务中，使用约50亿参数的Gemini-2.5-Flash模型达到45.5%准确率，相比70亿参数的DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen基线(5.2%)有显著提升，同时减少超过一半的输入/输出token和模型参数。

Conclusion: 精心设计的离散化和上下文选择策略可以在降低2倍以上推理成本的同时，保持基于提示的AMC方法的优势，实现实际应用部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecepChain是一种新型后门攻击范式，通过引导LLMs生成看似良性但最终得出错误结论的推理链，利用模型自身的幻觉进行攻击，具有高度隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs依赖思维链进行推理判断，这种依赖为攻击者创造了脆弱的基础。攻击者可以诱导模型生成看似合理但实际错误的推理过程，这种隐蔽风险尚未被充分探索。

Method: 利用LLMs自身的幻觉，通过对模型自然生成的错误推理进行微调，然后使用GRPO（Group Relative Policy Optimization）结合翻转奖励和合理性正则化器来强化攻击效果。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上，DecepChain实现了高攻击成功率，同时在良性场景下性能下降最小。人类评估显示难以区分被操纵的推理过程与良性推理。

Conclusion: 这种隐蔽的失败模式可能悄无声息地破坏LLM答案并削弱人类对LLM推理的信任，迫切需要未来研究应对这一警示性风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

Abstract: The exponential growth of internet generated data has fueled advancements in
artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) for
extracting actionable insights in marketing,telecom, and health sectors. This
chapter explores ML applications across three domains namely healthcare,
marketing, and telecommunications, with a primary focus on developing a
framework for optimal ML algorithm selection. In healthcare, the framework
addresses critical challenges such as cardiovascular disease prediction
accounting for 28.1% of global deaths and fetal health classification into
healthy or unhealthy states, utilizing three datasets. ML algorithms are
categorized into eager, lazy, and hybrid learners, selected based on dataset
attributes, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), and Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) scores. For validation, eight datasets from the
three sectors are employed in the experiments. The key contribution is a
recommendation framework that identifies the best ML model according to input
attributes, balancing performance evaluation and model complexity to enhance
efficiency and accuracy in diverse real-world applications. This approach
bridges gaps in automated model selection, offering practical implications for
interdisciplinary ML deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需跳跃连接即可稳定高效训练Transformer的方法，通过理论分析和初始化策略解决了无跳跃连接训练的优化难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然跳跃连接能稳定Transformer训练，但它们破坏了表示的层次结构。本文旨在探索是否能在不改变标准架构的情况下，稳定训练无跳跃连接的Transformer。

Method: 通过分析无跳跃连接Transformer块的雅可比矩阵，揭示了跳跃连接改善条件数的机制，并设计了一种原则性的初始化策略来恢复其稳定化效益。

Result: 在监督和自监督设置下，使用该初始化方法训练的无跳跃连接ViT克服了优化障碍，学习了更丰富的层次表示，并在密集预测基准上优于包含跳跃连接的强基线模型。

Conclusion: 跳跃连接不是训练ViT的基本要求，这为视觉模型中的层次表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

TL;DR: 提出了Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)框架，通过上下文好奇心正则化器增强决策预训练变换器，在离线预训练中利用预测误差作为内在好奇心信号，提高在分布外环境中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有决策预训练变换器(DPTs)在超出预训练数据分布时泛化能力不足，需要解决离线预训练中的探索限制问题。

Method: PPT框架在DPT基础上增加辅助奖励预测器，使用预测误差作为内在好奇心信号，通过上下文好奇心正则化器鼓励训练期间更广泛的探索。

Result: 在高斯多臂老虎机概念验证实验中，PPT显示出更好的鲁棒性，特别是在预训练数据多样性有限且测试环境奖励方差较高时，能缓解DPT的性能下降。

Conclusion: 虽然离线数据质量仍然至关重要，但好奇心驱动的预训练为提高上下文强化学习智能体的分布外泛化能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is
increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CMDPs比标准MDPs更复杂，因为缺乏对所有初始状态分布都最优的通用策略，每当初始分布改变时都需要重新求解CMDP。

Method: 使用CMDPs的对偶分析和线性规划的扰动分析来推导最优值随初始分布变化的边界。

Result: 推导出了CMDPs最优值随不同初始分布变化的边界，并展示了如何利用这些边界分析策略遗憾。

Conclusion: 该研究为处理CMDPs中初始分布变化问题提供了理论工具，能够分析策略在未知初始分布变化下的性能表现。

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的蛋白质结构标记化方法依赖于定制组件，虽然具有空间对称性不变性，但难以优化和扩展。

Method: 使用扩散自编码器结合流匹配损失，用全局坐标替代基于框架的表示，用标准注意力替代SE(3)不变注意力操作。

Result: 该方法稳定了参数高效模型的训练，在重建指标上优于现有标记化器，且模型规模和训练成本大幅降低。自回归模型在基于标记的生成模型中表现更好，但尚未达到最先进连续扩散模型的性能。

Conclusion: Kanzi简化了蛋白质结构标记化器的多个方面，提供了一种更稳定、高效的蛋白质结构表示和生成方法。

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成框架主要在连续空间中运行且多为单目标指导，而离散方法缺乏多目标帕累托最优性保证，需要开发能同时优化多个冲突目标的离散序列设计方法。

Method: 基于Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi)，结合Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火Metropolis-Hastings更新，偏置采样朝向帕累托最优状态同时保持分布不变性。

Result: 在肽和SMILES序列设计中，AReUReDi同时优化多达五个治疗属性（亲和力、溶解度、溶血性、半衰期和非污染性），表现优于进化和基于扩散的基线方法。

Conclusion: AReUReDi为多属性生物分子生成提供了一个强大、基于序列的框架，具有收敛到帕累托前沿的理论保证。

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

Motivation: 持续学习面临数据分布漂移的挑战，传统注意力机制可能过于复杂。研究旨在简化注意力机制同时保持核心归纳偏置。

Method: 提出仅查询注意力机制，丢弃键和值，但保留transformer架构的核心归纳偏置。通过Hessian谱分析验证模型塑性保持能力。

Result: 仅查询注意力在持续学习场景中显著缓解塑性损失和灾难性遗忘，性能优于基线方法。高曲率秩的模型更易保持塑性。

Conclusion: 完整注意力对于在持续学习中获取元学习益处并非必需，仅查询注意力机制是有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the

Result: 自适应模式与传统方法在K=3时性能相当（组内相关系数0.755），但能更快收敛（约30个样本即可准确拟合模型）并揭示空间负荷与特征绑定的个体差异交互作用。

Conclusion: 双轴自适应方法比传统单变量方法更高效，能提供更丰富的个体认知特征信息，为认知能力评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional,
staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single
factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a
Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive
virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task.
Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and
feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus
acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian
Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K)
rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population,
we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase
Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is
achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3.
Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial
load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other
sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for
accurate fitting of the full model.

Motivation: 由于混合模型架构设计空间巨大且训练成本高昂，手动探索难以发现最优组合。需要系统化方法来发现结合关键计算原语的最佳架构。

Method: 开发了模块化混合模型架构搜索框架Composer，在小规模探索架构，然后通过提出的缩放策略将表现最佳的架构扩展到更大规模。

Result: 发现的混合LLM架构在350M-3B参数规模下验证损失持续降低，下游任务准确率提升达2.8-8.3%（平均1.1-3.1%），同时提高了训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: Composer框架能够有效发现高性能混合模型架构，证明了系统化架构搜索在提升模型性能方面的重要价值。

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g.,
Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond
Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of
primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the
hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space
and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational
primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled
approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework --
Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and
extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our
proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM
architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous
state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce
validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy
on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving
both training and inference efficiency.

Result: 在MNIST数据集上实现了10倍的延迟减少，在多种密度估计基准测试中能够学习比先前方法多10倍变量的分布。

Conclusion: 该方法为概率张量网络学习提供了一种高效且数值稳定的解决方案，显著提升了建模能力。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through
shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly
appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable
computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters
of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with
automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we
propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is
numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in
time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative
modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of
distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to
a variety of density estimation benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 需要从噪声、不规则采样的轨迹中学习物理一致的连续时间动力学，同时估计哈密顿量的不确定性，并确保能量平衡和被动性。

Method: 在哈密顿量表面上放置高斯过程先验，将可变步长多步积分器约束编码为有限线性泛函，从而实现对向量场和哈密顿量表面的闭式条件化，无需潜在状态。

Result: 在质量-弹簧、Van der Pol和Duffing基准测试中展示了改进的向量场恢复和良好校准的哈密顿量不确定性。

Conclusion: MS-PHS GP能够有效学习物理一致的动力学，同时提供哈密顿量的不确定性估计，并在基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to
learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the
Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior
on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator
constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form
conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without
latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state
a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and
variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved
vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on
mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的数据选择方法，通过反转训练集和验证集的角色来选择对目标分布最有用的训练样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法将目标样本作为验证集，通过推理来估计训练样本的效果，但这种方法计算量大且效率低。

Method: 提出反转训练和验证的角色：在验证集上微调前后对训练池进行推理，选择预测变化最大的样本。

Result: 在指令调优和命名实体识别任务上的实验表明，该方法在大多数情况下比现有方法获得更低的测试对数损失。

Conclusion: 通过反转训练和验证集的角色来选择对目标分布最有用的训练样本是一种更简单、更快速且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process:
$(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on
task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely
reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that
only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data
selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate
the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by
performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of
train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and
after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose
predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most
affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most
beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on
instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases,
our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We
support our findings with theoretical analysis.

Method: 使用深度潜在变量模型（DLVM）整合多任务和个体观察数据，结合DALE自适应采样策略优化信息获取。

Result: DLVM在数据量较少时显著优于IMLE，收敛更快；DALE在前80次试验中优于随机采样和固定测试组合。

Abstract: Estimation (IMLE). DLVM integrates observations across multiple executive

adaptively guided sampling to maximize information gain, outperforming random

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络方法在图相似度计算中存在计算成本高或未能有效利用图结构信息的问题，需要更高效的近似方法。

Method: G2R将节点表示为嵌入空间中的封闭区域，通过区域重叠来近似最大公共子图，利用不相交部分作为图编辑距离的代理。

Conclusion: G2R提供了一种高效的图相似度计算方法，能够同时评估多种相似度指标，为图相关任务提供了全面的相似度评估。

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次对单层Mamba模型的训练动态和上下文学习泛化能力进行了理论分析，发现Mamba通过线性注意力层选择信息丰富的上下文示例，并通过非线性门控层抑制异常值的影响，相比线性Transformer具有更强的抗异常值能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型在计算效率上优于Transformer模型，并在多种语言任务中表现相当，具有上下文学习能力。但由于其门控机制引入的非线性，理论理解仍然有限，需要深入分析其训练动态和泛化性能。

Method: 分析单层Mamba模型的训练动态，该模型由线性注意力组件和非线性门控层组成，研究其在包含加性异常值的提示下对未见过的二元分类任务的上下文学习泛化能力。

Result: Mamba利用线性注意力层选择信息丰富的上下文示例，通过非线性门控层抑制异常值影响。虽然可能需要更多训练迭代才能收敛，但在异常值比例超过线性Transformer容忍阈值时仍能保持准确预测。

Conclusion: Mamba模型在上下文学习中具有更强的抗异常值能力，理论分析得到实证实验支持，为理解Mamba模型的机制提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational
advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable
performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba
exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for
new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without
requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity
introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer
Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a
nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary
classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our
analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select
informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress
the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of
linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may
require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions
even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear
Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NC-Iso是一种新颖的GNN架构，通过保持节点根子树中特征相对位置的分层依赖关系来解决子图匹配问题，并引入相似性主导比增强度量来提高匹配对的排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于GNN的子图匹配方法存在尺度差异问题，它们关注特征数量但忽略了特征在节点根子树中的相对位置，导致包含约束被破坏和错误预测。此外，它们的铰链距离度量对匹配图对缺乏区分能力，阻碍了排序应用。

Method: NC-Iso通过构建节点根子树内相邻梯队之间的分层依赖关系来保持特征的相对位置，确保匹配图对在特征数量上符合包含约束的同时保持一致的层次结构。引入相似性主导比增强度量来量化图对之间相似性相对于不相似性的主导程度。

Result: 在九个数据集上的实证结果验证了NC-Iso的有效性、泛化能力、可扩展性和可迁移性，同时保持了时间效率。

Conclusion: NC-Iso为子图检索提供了一个更具区分性的神经子图匹配解决方案，在保持时间效率的同时显著提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming
combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches
address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and
hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding
space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them
promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale
differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature
counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted
subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.
Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for
matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel
GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative
positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between
adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs
maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in
feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce
a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the
dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical
results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability,
scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency,
offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph
retrieval. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/NC-Iso.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个从字典学习推导稀疏自编码器的理论框架，揭示了现有SAE方法的局限性，并提出了新的AbsTopK SAE变体来支持双向概念表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器缺乏统一的理论推导框架，且其稀疏正则化器强制非负性，无法表示双向概念，导致语义轴分裂为冗余特征。

Method: 通过展开稀疏编码的近端梯度方法，推导出常见SAE变体，并提出基于ℓ0稀疏约束的AbsTopK SAE，通过保留正负激活来支持双向概念表示。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个任务上的实验表明，AbsTopK提高了重构保真度、增强了解释性，并能用单个特征编码对比概念，性能匹配甚至超过需要标注数据的监督方法。

Conclusion: AbsTopK SAE通过支持双向概念表示解决了现有SAE的结构性限制，提供了更丰富、完整的语义表示能力。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零阶方法依赖手工设计的静态采样策略，无法适应模型特定结构。观察到实践中只有少量基础模型及其衍生模型被广泛采用，因此为给定LLM一次性学习优化器并在不同下游任务中复用是可行且理想的。

Method: 设计了基于学习的零阶优化器，支持每个LLM一次性训练，开销最小化。通过紧凑高效的设计自动学习扰动策略。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个数据集上的实验表明，ZO Fine-tuner在82.1%的任务-模型组合中优于现有零阶基线方法。

Conclusion: ZO Fine-tuner展示了强大的性能和可扩展性，为高效LLM微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory
consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing
zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are
not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO
Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically
learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient
design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a
small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in
practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it
across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.
Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the
foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal
overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner
outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations,
thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM
fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 临床上下文的整合对于实现临床对齐的自动化放射学报告生成至关重要，公开了数据集、代码和检查点以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray
images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by
generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and
adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively
utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing
SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to
critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing
non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose
contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical
context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive
clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical
indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding
comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that
incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves
report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints
to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at

TL;DR: PromptLoop是一个即插即用的强化学习框架，通过多模态大语言模型在扩散模型采样过程中迭代更新提示，实现有效的奖励优化和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的扩散模型微调方法在泛化性、组合性和抗奖励攻击方面存在不足，而现有的提示优化方法大多采用前馈方式，未能充分利用强化学习的序列特性。

Method: 训练多模态大语言模型使用强化学习，基于扩散模型的中间潜状态迭代更新提示，而不是直接修改扩散模型权重。

Result: 在多种奖励函数和扩散骨干网络上的实验表明，PromptLoop能有效优化奖励、无缝泛化到未见模型、与现有对齐方法正交组合，并减轻过优化和奖励攻击问题。

Conclusion: PromptLoop通过将潜反馈纳入逐步提示优化，在保持基于提示的对齐方法灵活性的同时，实现了与Diffusion RL类似的结构类比。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

TL;DR: SADA是一种样本感知动态增强方法，根据样本对模型优化的动态影响自动调整增强强度，避免固定或随机增强导致的训练不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据增强方法大多使用固定或随机变换，但在动态训练环境中，样本难度会随模型泛化能力变化而变化。不考虑这种动态性会导致增强数据与模型训练需求不匹配，降低训练效果。

Method: 通过将样本梯度投影到累积模型更新方向，并计算局部训练窗口内的时间方差来估计样本影响。低方差样本（稳定影响）增强更强以强调多样性，高方差样本（不稳定影响）增强更弱以保持语义保真度。

Result: 在各种基准数据集和模型架构上的实验显示SADA带来一致改进，包括细粒度任务上+7.3%和长尾数据集上+4.3%的提升。

Conclusion: SADA是一种轻量级、即插即用的方法，无需辅助模型或策略调优，能有效提升训练效果，具有实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through
backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present
significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of
control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations,
enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work
builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems,
where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching
techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary
sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with
adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against
approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory
tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how
sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal
memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage
provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and
analysis.

TL;DR: UrbanGraph是一个物理信息框架，通过异质动态时空图整合关键物理过程，显著提升城市微气候预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着快速城市化，预测城市微气候变得至关重要，但现有生成式和同质图方法在物理一致性、空间依赖性和时间变异性方面存在不足

Method: 提出UrbanGraph框架，整合异质动态时空图，编码植被蒸散、遮阳和对流扩散等关键物理过程，建模不同城市实体间的复杂空间依赖及其时间演化

Result: 在UMC4/12物理模拟数据集上评估，UrbanGraph相比所有基线方法R²提升达10.8%，FLOPs减少17.0%，其中异质图和动态图分别贡献3.5%和7.1%的性能增益

Conclusion: 该数据集为时空微气候建模提供了首个高分辨率基准，该方法可扩展到更广泛的城市异质动态计算任务

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical,
as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing
generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical
consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this,
we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous
and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. It encodes key physical processes --
vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while
modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their
temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based
simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results
show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0%
over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and
7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for
spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban
heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered
in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging
data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus
mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial
dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection
methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods
can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised
and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these
methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any
statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse
and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem
is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition
where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial
and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.
Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly
scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The
proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

*Mingyuan Xia,Chunxu Zhang,Zijian Zhang,Hao Miao,Qidong Liu,Yuanshao Zhu,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeEmb是一个轻量级的静态-动态分解框架，用于解决时间序列预测中的时间非平稳性问题。它将时间序列分解为时间不变和时间变化两个互补组件，分别通过全局嵌入模块和频域滤波机制处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分布随时间变化的时间非平稳性给可靠预测带来挑战。现有方法往往将时间变化和时间不变组件混在一起学习，导致面对分布变化时性能不佳。

Method: 提出TimeEmb框架：1) 时间不变组件通过全局嵌入模块学习跨时间序列的持久表示；2) 时间变化组件通过受信号处理中全频谱分析启发的频域滤波机制处理。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，TimeEmb优于最先进的基线方法，且需要更少的计算资源。全面的定量和定性分析验证了静态-动态解缠的有效性。

Conclusion: TimeEmb通过静态-动态分解有效解决了时间非平稳性问题，这个轻量级框架还能通过简单集成改进现有的时间序列预测方法。

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions
change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series
forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two
factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static
and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often
conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the
combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal
performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively
propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time
series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two
complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel
global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time
series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient
frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in
signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational
resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to
verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight
framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple
integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at
https://github.com/showmeon/TimeEmb.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需排练缓冲区和任务边界的在线持续学习方法，通过结合提示学习和NCM分类器有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线持续学习方法要么使用排练缓冲区存储样本（可能引发数据安全和隐私问题），要么依赖任务边界（在单次数据处理中难以识别），因此需要研究无需排练和任务边界的在线持续学习。

Method: 将提示学习与NCM分类器相结合，在不存储样本且不使用任务边界或身份的情况下处理灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的广泛实验结果表明，所提出的方法具有有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了在线持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，无需存储样本或依赖任务边界，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 经验神经正切核(eNTK)的特征分析可以揭示训练后神经网络使用的特征，在两个标准玩具模型(TMS和模块加法)中，eNTK的顶部特征空间与真实特征对齐，并能用于特征发现和检测相变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过eNTK分析来发现神经网络使用的特征，并检测训练过程中的相变现象，为机制解释性提供实用工具。

Method: 在两个标准玩具模型(Toy Models of Superposition和1层MLP模块加法)上分析eNTK的特征谱，研究其特征空间与真实特征的对齐情况，以及层间eNTK和特征谱演化。

Result: eNTK在稀疏和密集状态下都能恢复真实特征，在模块加法中能恢复傅里叶特征族，层间eNTK能将特征定位到特定层，特征谱演化可用于诊断grokking相变。

Conclusion: eNTK分析为小模型中的特征发现和相变检测提供了实用方法。

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel
(eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two
standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of
Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that
the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with
ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in
both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic,
the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide
evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that
the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking
phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a
practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small
models.

### [225] [Diagnosing Shortcut-Induced Rigidity in Continual Learning: The Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00475)
*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)指标来诊断持续学习中的捷径特征依赖问题，发现在CIFAR-100基准测试中，持续学习方法虽然学习速度更快，但最终精度略低，且更容易受到无关特征干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络经常利用捷径特征，这些特征在持续学习中会持续存在并加剧，导致模型偏向于使用过去任务中最容易满足标签的特征，阻碍新技能的获取。

Method: 引入ERI诊断指标，包含三个可解释方面：适应延迟、性能赤字和相对次优特征依赖。在CIFAR-100持续学习基准上评估多种持续学习方法，并在第二阶段故意添加虚假的洋红色补丁。

Result: 持续学习方法比从头开始训练的基线更早达到精度阈值，但在包含捷径特征的类别上最终精度略低。遮盖补丁后持续学习方法精度提高，而基线略有下降，表明补丁对持续学习模型起干扰作用。

Conclusion: 捷径特征在持续学习中主要起干扰作用而非帮助作用，持续学习方法更容易受到无关特征的负面影响，这反映了认知Einstellung效应在机器学习中的表现。

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

TL;DR: DVD是一个基于潜在扩散模型的源自由域适应框架，通过扩散网络在潜在空间中生成源域线索来对齐目标域特征，无需访问源数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型主要关注生成任务，其在判别性迁移方面的潜力未被充分探索。源自由域适应面临无法访问源数据的核心挑战。

Method: 在源域训练扩散网络，将标签信息编码到特征邻域的高斯先验中；在目标域使用冻结的扩散模块生成源域线索，通过InfoNCE损失对齐目标编码器。

Result: 在标准SFDA基准测试中超越最先进方法；同一扩散模块还能提升源分类器在域内数据的准确性，并在监督分类和域泛化实验中提升性能。

Conclusion: DVD将潜在扩散模型重新解释为实用、保护隐私的知识迁移桥梁，解决了源自由域适应中先前方法未能解决的核心挑战。

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively
on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer
largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a
novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained
classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the
source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source
feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian
prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift
noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we
sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion
module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the
target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries
without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module
enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts
performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.
DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for
explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain
adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

Motivation: 现有黑盒域自适应方法主要针对视觉应用，无法直接应用于具有独特时空特性的时间序列数据，且尚未探索基础模型在黑盒时间序列域自适应中的潜力。

Method: 构建基于时间序列基础模型的双分支网络结构，每个分支配备独特提示来捕捉数据分布的不同特征，在域自适应阶段开发提示级和输入级的重构学习。

Result: 在三个不同应用领域的时间序列数据集上的严格实验证明，CPFM相比竞争对手取得了显著优势，获得了明显的性能提升。

Conclusion: CPFM方法成功解决了黑盒时间序列域自适应问题，通过利用基础模型和跨提示学习机制，在多个时间序列数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the
privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface
(API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the
BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly
target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the
time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In
addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation
model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes
a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM
is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is
equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data
distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning
phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon
a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our
rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved
results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series
datasets of different application domains.

TL;DR: 研究比较了LLM推理的两种架构：双模型潜在推理vs单模型统一架构。在相同潜在token预算下，单模型统一架构表现接近最佳双模型设计，表明当前双模型设计主要增加了计算量而非显著提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM推理应该采用分离模块还是单模型架构，测试双架构潜在推理中提高通道容量和联合微调两种假设是否能改善潜在通信。

Method: 在GPT-2和Qwen-3上使用匹配的潜在token预算，比较双架构（Base与Coprocessor交换潜在消息）与单模型统一软嵌入基线。测试了GSM8K、ProsQA和Countdown压力测试。

Result: H2（联合微调）表现最强，H1（增加通道容量）仅有小幅提升。单模型统一架构几乎匹配H2并超越H1。扩大潜在token预算未能提升鲁棒性，潜在分析显示子空间重叠且专业化有限。

Conclusion: 双模型潜在推理在理论上仍有潜力，但可能需要明确针对算法规划设计目标和通信机制来塑造潜在空间。

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's
forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent
reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor,
and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al.
(2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint
finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is
consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding
baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations,
using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1,
suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively
improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with
increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small
values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces
with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude
dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires
objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for
algorithmic planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习或直接反向传播的扩散对齐方法虽然能最大化奖励，但容易导致奖励过优化和模式崩溃问题。

Method: 采用变分期望最大化框架：E步通过测试时搜索生成多样且奖励对齐的样本；M步使用E步发现的样本精炼扩散模型。

Result: 在文本到图像合成和DNA序列设计等连续和离散任务中，DAV能够优化奖励同时保持多样性。

Conclusion: DAV框架有效解决了扩散对齐中的奖励过优化和模式崩溃问题，实现了奖励优化与多样性的平衡。

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream
objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct
backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often
suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion
Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that
formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two
complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ
test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step,
we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We
demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both
continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

TL;DR: 差分注意力机制通过减法结构抑制冗余上下文，减少幻觉，但增加了对抗性攻击的脆弱性，揭示了选择性与鲁棒性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究差分注意力机制在提升任务相关焦点时，是否会引入对抗性扰动的结构性脆弱性。

Method: 通过理论分析识别负梯度对齐是敏感度放大的关键驱动因素，并在ViT/DiffViT和预训练CLIP/DiffCLIP上进行系统实验，涵盖五个数据集。

Result: 差分注意力导致更高的攻击成功率、频繁的梯度对立和更强的局部敏感性，深度实验显示在小扰动下通过噪声抵消提供保护，但在大攻击预算下保护减弱。

Conclusion: 差分注意力在干净输入上提升判别焦点，但增加了对抗性脆弱性，未来注意力机制需要同时考虑选择性和鲁棒性设计。

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard
attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive
structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design
sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural
fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies
negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as
the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient
norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this
Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations
of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results
demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and
stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,
depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers
attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though
this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings
uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean
inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to
jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型中前馈网络(FFN)的频谱利用率问题，发现软秩随宽度呈幂律增长而硬秩仅次线性增长，表明增加FFN宽度主要添加低能量尾方向，而主导模式子空间早期饱和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律关注模型大小与损失的关系，但忽略了组件如何利用其潜在空间。论文旨在研究FFN的频谱利用率，量化有多少潜在方向被有效激活。

Method: 使用轻量级诊断套件（硬秩、软秩、频谱集中度和复合频谱利用率指数）来量化LLaMA、GPT-2和nGPT系列模型中潜在方向的激活情况。

Result: 发现不对称的频谱缩放定律：软秩随FFN宽度几乎完美遵循幂律，而硬秩仅次线性增长且方差高。在更大宽度下，方差进一步坍缩到狭窄子空间，导致大部分潜在空间未被充分利用。

Conclusion: 将FFN宽度选择重新定义为尾容量与主导模式容量之间的权衡，为推理效率高的LLM设计提供具体指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large
they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing
scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit
their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width
selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic
suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral
Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we
quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA,
GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling
law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard
rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests
that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode
subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further
collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space
under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled
trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete
guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

Method: 使用来自WHO和UN的真实世界数据集，评估线性回归、回归决策树和随机森林三种机器学习模型，通过R²、MAE和RMSE等指标评估性能，并采用p值和特征重要性进行模型解释。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳（R²=0.9423），显著优于线性回归和回归决策树。免疫接种率（白喉、麻疹）和人口属性（HIV/AIDS、成人死亡率）被识别为关键预测因素。

Conclusion: 集成方法与可解释性的结合能有效应对公共卫生挑战，未来研究应探索更先进的插补策略、替代算法和更新数据，以进一步提高预测准确性并支持循证决策。

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and
socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging
due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors.
This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR),
Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world
dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN)
sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and
inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF
achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly
outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for
LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing
immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS,
adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These
insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in
addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced
imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and
updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based
policymaking in global health contexts.

TL;DR: 该研究发现LLM在强化学习训练中存在两个关键特性：秩1主导性和秩1线性动态，基于此提出了AlphaRL加速框架，可在保持性能的同时实现2.5倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLM在强化学习训练中的参数动态变化机制，以开发更高效、可解释的训练方法。

Method: 通过分析8个LLM和7种算法的参数更新矩阵，识别秩1主导性和线性动态特性，并基于此设计AlphaRL加速框架。

Result: 验证了秩1特性在多种模型和算法中的普适性，AlphaRL实现了2.5倍加速且保持96%以上推理性能。

Conclusion: 该发现为大规模RL训练提供了原则性、可解释且高效的新范式，有望推动LLM训练方法的革新。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter
dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two
fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1
Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix
nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of
performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace
evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early
checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the
generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these
findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that
extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window,
achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning
performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our
finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path
toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文为状态空间模型(SSMs)提供了理论解释，揭示了记忆精度与长度之间的权衡，证明了初始参数的重要性，并提出固定循环权重的优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未能充分解释SSMs高性能背后的机制，缺乏对其学习动态的理论理解。

Method: 通过分析输入时间序列在状态中的存储方式评估SSMs的记忆能力，建立S4模型与简化对角循环权重模型的等效性，并通过实验验证理论发现。

Result: 实验证实延长记忆很困难，强调初始化的重要性；固定循环权重比自适应权重能获得相当或更好的性能，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 研究为SSMs提供了新的理论基础，并可能提供一种新颖的优化策略。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to
outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently
addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of
theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide
such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory
capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored
in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory
accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the
structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal
recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the
learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical
results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure
to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the
gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long
memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance
of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be
more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even
higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new
theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization
strategy.

TL;DR: PANORAMA通过机器学习驱动的正交变换解决ANNS验证瓶颈，将90%以上信号能量压缩到前半维度，实现早期候选剪枝和部分距离计算，在多种ANNS方法中获得2-30倍端到端加速且无召回损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ANNS系统在最终精炼阶段花费高达99%的查询时间计算距离，存在严重的验证瓶颈问题。

Method: 使用数据自适应学习的正交变换，结合层级主内存布局、SIMD向量化部分距离计算和缓存感知访问模式，无需修改索引即可集成到IVFPQ/Flat、HNSW、MRPT和Annoy等ANNS方法中。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、GIST、OpenAI Ada 2和Large 3等多种数据集上的实验表明，PANORAMA实现了2-30倍的端到端加速，且没有召回损失。

Conclusion: PANORAMA通过机器学习驱动的正交变换有效解决了ANNS验证瓶颈，显著提升了查询效率，为大规模向量检索系统提供了实用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

TL;DR: 本文改进了私有在线学习问题，针对具有有限Littlestone维度的概念类，提出了新算法在可实现设置下达到O(log T)错误率（适应对抗者），并在不可知设置下获得O(√T)的次线性遗憾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前工作Golowich和Livni[2021]证明了有限Littlestone维度的概念类在可实现设置下可私有在线学习，但其算法对适应对抗者的错误率界为O(√T)，不够理想。本文旨在缩小这一差距。

Method: 提出新的私有在线学习算法，针对具有有限Littlestone维度的概念类，在可实现设置下处理适应对抗者，并在不可知设置下扩展应用。

Result: 在可实现设置下，新算法对适应对抗者达到O(log T)的错误率，改进了先前的O(√T)结果；在不可知设置下获得O(√T)的次线性遗憾，证明此类概念类也可私有在线学习。

Conclusion: 本文成功缩小了私有在线学习中可实现设置下的性能差距，并扩展了私有在线学习的适用范围到不可知设置，为有限Littlestone维度概念类提供了更优的私有学习保证。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner
receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a
hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should
satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021]
established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone
dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In
particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake
bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a
suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In
this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$
against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the
problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable
setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm
that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic
Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online
learnable in the agnostic setting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Eyes-on-Me是一种模块化的RAG数据投毒攻击方法，通过可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域实现低成本攻击，在18种RAG设置中将攻击成功率从21.9%提升至57.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统的数据投毒攻击扩展性差，需要为每个目标短语优化投毒文档，成本高昂。

Method: 将对抗文档分解为可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域，吸引器优化用于引导注意力到焦点区域，攻击者可在焦点区域插入语义诱饵或恶意指令，通过操控与攻击成功强相关的少量注意力头实现攻击。

Result: 在18个端到端RAG设置中，攻击成功率从21.9%提升至57.8%（提升35.9个百分点，是先前工作的2.6倍），单个优化的吸引器无需重新训练即可迁移到未见过的黑盒检索器和生成器。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可扩展的RAG数据投毒范式，表明模块化、可重用的组件对现代AI系统构成实际威胁，并揭示了注意力集中与模型输出之间的强关联，为可解释性研究提供信息。

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的校准指标ETCE来评估降水临近预报的概率校准质量，并开发了基于选择性缩放和预报时效条件的后处理技术来改善模型校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经天气模型在降水临近预报中会产生校准不良的概率预测，而现有的标准校准指标无法有效捕捉不同降水阈值下的校准问题。

Method: 引入了期望阈值校准误差(ETCE)指标，并将计算机视觉领域的后处理技术扩展到预报领域，采用选择性缩放和预报时效条件的方法。

Result: 选择性缩放结合预报时效条件能够在不降低预报质量的情况下有效减少模型的校准误差。

Conclusion: ETCE指标能更好地捕捉有序类别(如降水量)的校准问题，所提出的后处理技术显著改善了降水临近预报的概率校准性能。

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive
decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated
probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected
calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation
thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a
new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like
precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer
vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with
lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the
forecast quality.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了结构因果最优传输方法，通过结合结构方程来增强分布鲁棒优化中的模糊集，使其包含更现实的概率分布，并解决了最优传输问题的维度诅咒问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分布鲁棒优化方法仅利用了因果图信息来设计模糊集，但忽略了结构方程中包含的额外信息。为了平衡保守性和准确性，需要利用结构方程来增强模糊集，使其包含更现实的概率分布。

Method: 提出了结构因果最优传输及其关联的模糊集，引入了一个松弛版本，用正则化项替代复杂的因果约束，通过凸差规划实现高效算法。当结构信息缺失时，方法仍有效并提供有限样本保证。

Result: 该方法能够克服最优传输问题的维度诅咒，实现维度无关的更快收缩速度。与先前方法相比，结构因果最优传输能够生成更现实的分布。

Conclusion: 通过结合结构方程信息，结构因果最优传输方法显著增强了分布鲁棒优化中模糊集的实用性，在保持计算效率的同时提供了更好的分布建模能力。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like
overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a
range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance
conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability
distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming
that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed
acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as
adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal
graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose
incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to
enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce
structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,
demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key
benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term
replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via
difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.
We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,
our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,
we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes
the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster
shrinkage with dimension-free order.

TL;DR: 提出MA-SCLUCB算法，在多智能体网络环境中解决带阶段保守约束的随机线性赌博机问题，在保证安全性的同时实现近最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中多个学习智能体需要在探索与利用之间平衡，同时保持安全保证以避免灾难性失败，特别是在推荐系统等场景中。

Method: MA-SCLUCB算法，采用交替执行动作选择和共识构建阶段，智能体仅与邻居通信，满足阶段保守约束（期望奖励不低于基线策略的(1-α)倍）。

Result: 算法以高概率实现遗憾界$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$，其中d为维度，T为时间范围，|λ₂|为网络第二大特征值幅度。

Conclusion: 分布式学习在合理连接网络中可实现近最优性能，协作带来1/√N改进，通信开销仅对数增长，阶段安全约束仅增加低阶遗憾。

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple
learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining
safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic
linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must
satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents
collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected
reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline
policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the
network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).
Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round
incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise
Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action
selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves
regret
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$
with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and
$|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our
analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement
despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only
logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds
only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees
achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

TL;DR: FAME是一个端到端的函数对函数回归框架，通过双向神经控制微分方程和混合专家模型构建连续注意力机制，在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数数据的无限维特性使表示学习面临挑战，传统统计模型依赖预选基展开或核函数限制了数据驱动发现的灵活性，而深度学习通常将函数视为固定网格向量忽略了内在连续性。

Method: FAME结合双向神经控制微分方程与混合专家驱动的向量场来捕捉函数内连续性，并通过多头交叉注意力融合函数间依赖关系的变化。

Result: 在合成和真实世界函数回归基准测试中，FAME实现了最先进的准确性，对函数的任意离散采样观测具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FAME提供了一个完全数据驱动的函数对函数回归框架，能够有效处理函数数据的连续性和依赖关系，在准确性和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their
infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.
Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or
kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many
deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring
inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a
Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for
function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a
bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector
fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to
inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show
that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily
sampled discrete observations of functions.

TL;DR: EF21-Muon是首个具有严格收敛保证的通信高效、非欧几里得LMO优化器，支持随机梯度、动量和双向压缩，在NanoGPT实验中实现了7倍的通信节省且无精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器如Muon、Scion和Gluon虽然通过利用层间线性最小化预言机在非欧几里得范数球上推动了大规模深度学习，但缺乏原则性的分布式框架，通信瓶颈未解决，且现有分布式变体都是启发式的，没有收敛保证。

Method: 提出EF21-Muon，首个具有严格收敛保证的通信高效非欧几里得LMO优化器，支持随机梯度、动量和带误差反馈的双向压缩，这是误差反馈首次扩展到非欧几里得设置。

Result: EF21-Muon在压缩关闭和特定范数选择时恢复Muon/Scion/Gluon，提供了该强大系列的首个高效分布式实现。理论涵盖非欧几里得平滑和更一般的(L^0,L^1)-平滑设置，匹配已知最佳欧几里得速率，并在合适范数选择下实现更快收敛。

Conclusion: EF21-Muon在NanoGPT基准测试中相比未压缩的Muon/Scion/Gluon展示了高达7倍的通信节省，且无精度退化，成功解决了分布式非欧几里得优化的通信瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of
large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles
(LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in
ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework
exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The
very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in
sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean
LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports
stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error
feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean
setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific
norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of
this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more
general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and
enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the
analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the
anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking
EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$
communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and
physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a
physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing
tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak
foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order
ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed
component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven
component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme
learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least
squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element
method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried
out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring
locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that
monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile
deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling
zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed
and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The
proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety
assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning
systems in geotechnical engineering.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多种机器学习算法在数字发展干预文档分类中的性能，采用One vs Rest方法构建组合模型来优化多分类任务，发现数据量不是唯一影响因素，类内相似性和类间差异性也很关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数字干预领域的快速发展，需要改进数字发展组织的工作报告方式。传统的单一模型在多分类任务中表现不佳，且不同数据集间存在上下文差异，因此需要训练和评估多个模型来优化结果。

Method: 使用决策树、k近邻、支持向量机、AdaBoost、随机梯度下降、朴素贝叶斯和逻辑回归等ML算法，采用One vs Rest方法构建组合模型，使用过采样处理类别不平衡问题，通过准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数评估性能。

Result: 研究发现数据量不是影响性能的唯一因素，类内相似性和类间差异性对分类性能同样重要。通过One vs Rest方法构建的组合模型能够优化多分类任务的性能。

Conclusion: 在数字发展干预文档分类中，采用组合模型方法比单一模型更有效，且需要考虑类内相似性和类间差异性等特征因素，而不仅仅是数据量的大小。

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a
model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly
for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and
evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study
employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development
interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are
still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the
exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for
improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The
paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic
Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate
the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the
class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach
of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper
investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises
the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole
factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and
dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

Motivation: 结合随机过程理论和深度学习，为复杂系统中的生存现象提供基于物理的可解释参数化建模，同时避免比例风险假设。

Method: 使用深度神经网络将输入变量映射到物理意义参数（初始条件、漂移、扩散），在选择的FHT过程（如布朗运动）中表示事件时间为潜在扩散过程首次到达吸收边界的时间。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂系统中的生存现象建模提供了原则性途径，结合了随机过程理论和深度学习的优势。

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine
learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to
define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and
unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods
are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or
on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning
enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across
multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we
introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations
into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a
policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies
directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward
function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of
TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that
capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the
predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically,
TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion,
navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench,
especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

Result: 时间序列基础模型的零样本能力受预训练领域影响显著，在未见数据上微调后性能提升有限

Conclusion: 时间序列数据的固有多样性使得基础模型方法效果不佳，专门的小模型更具优势

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with
strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when
fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language
and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time
series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We
demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the
zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly
influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on.
Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned
foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results,
relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller,
dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Conclusion: LEAP编码作为图表示学习流水线的强大组件具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm,
where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet,
standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented
theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has
emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable
geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this
work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its
local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local
structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world
datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract
topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based
encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

Conclusion: 优化器选择对LLM遗忘鲁棒性至关重要，混合优化器方法能有效平衡遗忘效果和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence
of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its
utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing
privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning
effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight
quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.
Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives
by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take
a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent
of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We
show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it
exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order
(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the
resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,
such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,
gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While
these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage
convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby
resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with
randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust
unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that
combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy
while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP
benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our
approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning
quality.

Motivation: 现有反馈范式依赖发送新消息，但LLM难以可靠整合这些反馈，导致改进不一致。需要更有效的机制来指导LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Method: 引入原位反馈范式，用户直接编辑模型先前响应，模型基于修改后的响应生成修订版本，而非传统多轮对话方式。

Result: 在多样化推理密集型基准测试中，原位反馈比传统多轮反馈性能更好，同时使用79.1%更少的token。控制环境分析显示原位反馈能更精确地修正错误部分。

Conclusion: 原位反馈为LLM在推理密集型任务中提供了更自然有效的指导机制，解决了传统反馈范式无法精确应用反馈到错误部分的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of
multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on
user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require
complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new
messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent
improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction
paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model
conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical
evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place
feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback
while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled
environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core
limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback
precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and
sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These
findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective
mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

Method: 提供设计选择和实现方案，通过用户以系统无关方式表达的显式约束来定义感兴趣区域，在保持全局多样性的同时高效发现约束多样性。

Result: 实现了在用户感兴趣区域内最大化模式多样性的样本高效探索，支持交互式系统探索。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决复杂系统探索中的挑战，在考虑用户期望的同时保持模式多样性，为科学和艺术应用提供实用工具。

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their
use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the
challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly
non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition,
artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of
particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of
challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design
choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the
maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of
interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient
manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit
constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic
way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to
constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

Conclusion: 该研究建立了社交媒体平台算法干预与多臂老虎机理论之间的关键联系，为在线设置下的极化和分歧最小化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike
prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate
opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions
are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel
setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media
platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key
connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and
theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a
scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an
intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm
based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace
estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then
employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation
derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $
\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$.
Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a
linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态平衡探索和奖励驱动引导，增强了利用能力而不牺牲多样性，在大型稀疏高奖励搜索空间中表现优异。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample
from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize
optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and
reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes
them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial
optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to
overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,
particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,
improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing
diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we
integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets
sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation
toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to
balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a
controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method
enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing
exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our
method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but
also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity
of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot
generalization across diverse forecasting tasks. However, their robustness to
continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned
sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with
varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between
adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal
that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes
significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental
stability-plasticity dilemma.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态学习引导权重的方法，替代传统的静态权重CFG，通过最小化分布不匹配来优化条件扩散模型的采样质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFG使用固定的引导权重，虽然能提升感知质量但会损害分布对齐。需要一种能更好近似目标条件分布的方法。

Method: 学习连续函数形式的引导权重ω_{c,(s,t)}，作为条件c、起始时间t和目标时间s的函数。通过最小化真实条件分布与引导扩散过程样本间的分布不匹配来实现。

Result: 在低维和高维图像生成任务中均有效，改善了FID指标。在文本到图像应用中，使用CLIP分数作为奖励函数能提升图像-提示对齐。

Conclusion: 动态引导权重方法比静态CFG能更好地平衡感知质量和分布对齐，特别是在奖励引导采样框架下表现更佳。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the
perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by
linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a
guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve
visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional
alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,
we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous
functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the
time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the
distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional
distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our
framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions
tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a
conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on
low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we
observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image
generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward
function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve
image-prompt alignment.

Conclusion: 曲率感知策略优化方法能够可靠地跟踪优化动态并利用二阶几何信息，实现更高效的样本利用和可扩展的后训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has
played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting
remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to
conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more
training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models
for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them
into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes
scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic
optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of
second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that
tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further
employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process
through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy
Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and
masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees
under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we
empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning
regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention
(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in
sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query
while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We
formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise
preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding
label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we
introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning
method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive
fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical
instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
(FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose
four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model
quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the
RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods
achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness
and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose
OpenAI embedding model.

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the
Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete
microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study
proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training
dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address
the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes
due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts
WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete
microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of
evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We
validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic
populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population
dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology
successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained
with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to
the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with
incomplete data, opening avenues for future research, and highlighting the
potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis

*Thiziri Nait Saada,Louis Bethune,Michal Klein,David Grangier,Marco Cuturi,Pierre Ablin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 对基于分类器的质量过滤(CQF)方法进行深入分析，发现虽然CQF能提升下游任务性能，但不一定改善高质量数据集上的语言建模能力，因为CQF会隐式过滤高质量数据集本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模模型在包含混合质量文档的网络爬取数据集上预训练，数据过滤至关重要。CQF方法通过训练二元分类器来区分预训练数据和小型高质量数据集，但需要深入分析其实际效果。

Method: 分析CQF方法的工作原理，比较CQF过滤后的模型与在通过随机标记排列获得的合成数据上训练的模型的行为差异。

Result: CQF虽然能提升下游任务性能，但不一定改善高质量数据集上的语言建模，且与合成数据训练模型表现出截然不同的趋势。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了CQF能捕捉有意义数据质量概念的观点，表明CQF的效果可能并非源于其对数据质量的准确评估。

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

*Tanay Rastogi,Daniel Jonsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用条件表格生成对抗网络(CT-GAN)来生成目标人口的方法，包括直接使用边际约束或与FBS-CO混合的方法。结果显示CT-GAN单独使用时表现最佳，能生成符合单变量分布的群体，但在保持多变量关系方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统确定性人口合成方法在处理高维数据、可扩展性和零单元问题时面临挑战，特别是在为目标场景生成人口时。

Method: 使用CT-GAN直接生成目标人口，或采用混合方法将CT-GAN与FBS-CO结合。CT-GAN生成基础人口，FBS-CO进行优化以符合目标年份边际约束。

Result: 独立CT-GAN模型表现最佳，能生成符合单变量分布的群体，但在保持多变量关系方面存在困难。混合模型相比FBS-CO有改进，通过CT-GAN生成描述性基础人口，再用FBS-CO优化。

Conclusion: CT-GAN是生成目标人口的有效方法，深度生成模型可以与传统合成技术成功集成以提升性能。

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
enhance their performance.

Conclusion: 可视化分析为数据质量评估提供了可扩展的通用框架，强调了数据质量在AI驱动能源管理系统中的关键作用，未来可指导数据清洗策略提升LSTM和GRU模型的热需求预测准确性。

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks,
sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal
inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper
presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using
visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The
dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series
plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and
anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the
modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret
data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality
assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a
Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from
nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic
data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the
accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated
Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a
scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the
critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GreenLightningAI (GLAI) 是一种新型架构模块，通过分离结构知识和定量知识来替代传统MLP，实现更高效的训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLP在训练过程中将结构知识和定量知识纠缠在一起，导致训练效率低下。GLAI旨在分离这两种知识，提高训练效率。

Method: GLAI通过固定稳定的ReLU激活模式来分离结构知识，将MLP重新表述为路径组合，仅优化定量组件。

Result: GLAI在保持MLP通用逼近能力的同时，平均减少约40%的训练时间，在各种实验设置中始终匹配或超过等效参数MLP的准确率。

Conclusion: GLAI建立了一种新的设计原则，为未来集成到大型架构（如Transformer）开辟了方向，其中MLP块占主导计算开销。

Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block
designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to
separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i)
*structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by
ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical
weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates
the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is
optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities
of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time
by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is
not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever
they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers
in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse
experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs
with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI
establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future
integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP
blocks dominate the computational footprint.

Motivation: 研究损失函数在基于价值的强化学习方法中的影响，探索不同损失函数与回归目标的对应关系，以改进策略学习效果。

Method: 理论分析不同预测目标（平均绝对误差和均方误差）对策略次优性差距的影响，并通过实证研究比较交叉熵损失和平方损失在强化学习中的表现。

Result: 理论证明平均绝对误差是比均方误差更好的预测目标，交叉熵损失与平均绝对误差更匹配，平方损失与均方误差更匹配，且基于交叉熵损失的算法在线性强化学习中表现更优。

Conclusion: 选择合适的损失函数对强化学习性能至关重要，交叉熵损失与平均绝对误差的组合能够产生更好的策略学习效果。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based
methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction
objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better
prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling
the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that
different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression
objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute
error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical
evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform
those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

Method: 提出BoMGene混合特征选择方法，有效整合Boruta和mRMR两种流行技术，在25个公开基因表达数据集上进行实验，使用SVM、随机森林、XGBoost和GBM等分类器。

Result: Boruta-mRMR组合相比单独使用mRMR减少了所选特征数量，加快了训练时间，同时保持甚至提高了分类准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在多类基因表达数据分析中展现出准确性、稳定性和实际应用性的明显优势。

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data,
enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for
high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature
selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the
feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted
on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB),
and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the
Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to
just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even
improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature
selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in
accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene
expression data analysis

TL;DR: 提出了RiskPO方法，用风险度量替代传统均值目标，通过混合风险价值目标增强梯度信号，防止熵崩溃，在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成任务中显著优于GRPO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于均值的强化学习方法（如GRPO）存在熵崩溃和推理能力提升有限的问题，原因是过度关注高概率输出序列而忽略了稀有但信息丰富的推理路径。

Method: 提出RiskPO方法：1）使用混合风险价值目标，对奖励分布的多个区域进行加权关注；2）设计捆绑方案，将多个问题聚合为捆绑包以丰富反馈信号；3）理论上证明风险规避更新能缓解熵崩溃并促进探索。

Result: 在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成基准测试中，RiskPO在Pass@1和Pass@k指标上均显著优于GRPO及其变体，实现了持续且显著的改进。

Conclusion: 基于风险的优化为增强LLM推理能力提供了一个严谨有效的范式，能够有效解决现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: RLVR使用自动验证器训练策略以避免人工标注成本，但二元奖励会引入假阴性和假阳性错误。本文提出两种纠正算法：反向校正通过去偏观测奖励恢复无偏策略梯度估计；前向校正仅需假阴性率即可使更新方向与干净梯度对齐。实验表明两种方法均优于未校正训练，前向校正收敛更快且在强噪声下更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR系统为降低验证器被攻击的风险，在训练中使用二元奖励{0,1}，但这会引入假阴性（拒绝正确答案）和假阳性（接受错误答案）问题，影响训练效果。

Method: 将验证器建模为具有不对称噪声率的随机奖励通道，提出两种纠正算法：反向校正通过去偏观测奖励恢复无偏策略梯度估计；前向校正仅需假阴性率即可重加权得分函数项，使期望更新方向与干净梯度对齐。

Result: 在数学推理模型和基准测试中，两种校正方法均优于未校正训练；前向校正收敛更快且在强噪声下保持稳定。通过轻量级LLM验证器在线估计假阴性率，性能优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的两种验证器错误校正算法能有效提升RLVR训练效果，特别是前向校正具有收敛快、稳定性好的优势，为实际应用提供了可行的错误纠正机制。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against
automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to
verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during
training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives}
(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting
incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct
fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical
$\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large
language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single
adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We
formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic
reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive
two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward}
correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an
\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a
\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the
expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it
requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group
relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on
math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both
corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges
faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical
appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate
online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared
with other state-of-the-art contenders.

TL;DR: RECAP是一种通过对抗性思维预填充来增强大模型安全对齐的强化学习方法，能在不增加训练成本的情况下显著提升模型的安全性和抗攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大推理模型虽然能生成结构化思维链，但在安全对齐方面缺乏批判性推理能力，容易受到错误前提的影响而产生偏见。

Method: 使用强化学习从人类反馈中训练模型，混合合成生成的对抗性思维链预填充和标准提示，教导模型覆盖错误的推理轨迹并转向安全响应。

Result: RECAP显著提高了安全性和抗越狱攻击能力，减少了过度拒绝，同时保持了核心推理能力，且不增加推理令牌预算。

Conclusion: RECAP训练后的模型更频繁地进行自我反思，在自适应攻击下保持稳健，即使经过多次尝试覆盖其推理过程也能保持安全性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured
chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the
ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when
a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP
(Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled
reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches
models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and
helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated
counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional
training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness,
reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while
maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained
models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under
adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override
their reasoning.

Motivation: 传统认为GRPO需要大组规模来确保稳定训练，但这带来巨大计算开销。本文质疑这一假设，受DPO经验成功的启发，探索最小化rollout数量的可行性。

Method: 将GRPO重新框架化为对比学习形式，揭示其与DPO的根本联系，并研究仅使用2个rollout的最小配置(2-GRPO)。

Result: 2-GRPO在性能上与16-GRPO相当，但仅使用1/8的rollout，训练时间减少超过70%。

Conclusion: GRPO并不需要大组规模，2-GRPO是可行且高效的替代方案，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step
generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models
have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their
applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved
geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),
which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while
respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian
geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based
parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and
continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical
equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency
distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal
vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the
conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training
objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential
calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for
interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through
extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in
few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,
spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

Conclusion: S-SWIM为SNN训练提供了数据驱动、快速、高性能且可解释的解决方案，有效解决了SNN训练难题

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative
to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and
sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train
with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking
non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random
Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response
Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation
of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,
fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of
SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We
provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical
experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series
forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation
strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that
our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease
outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each
round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may
either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true
label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their
feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of
costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of
misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$,
with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel
algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to
estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a
conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score
$|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target
misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared
to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature
distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for
error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive
medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing
that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while
retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

Abstract: We introduce a novel version of the geometric scattering transform for

scattering transform has desirable symmetries with respect to rigid-body
roto-translations (i.e., $SE(3)$-equivariance) and may be incorporated into a
geometric GNN framework. We empirically show that our equivariant
scattering-based GNN achieves comparable performance to other equivariant
message-passing-based GNNs at a fraction of the parameter count.

TL;DR: 本文分析了无意义token提升LLM推理性能的机制，提出激活重分布模块(ARM)来模拟这种效果，无需修改输入序列即可提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现插入无意义token能提升LLM推理能力，但缺乏理论解释，本文旨在揭示其机制并开发更有效的方法。

Method: 提出激活重分布模块(ARM)，在推理时识别并调整MLP层中接近零的激活值，模拟无意义token带来的激活重分布效果。

Result: 实验表明ARM在各种基准测试和模型架构中都能稳定提升LLM推理性能，且实现简单只需几行代码。

Conclusion: 本文不仅解释了无意义token提升性能的机制，还提供了简单有效的ARM技术来利用激活重分布进一步提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of
meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM
reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this
phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that
allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements
arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near
zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations
increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by
suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.
Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module
(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations
directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies
near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,
implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a
controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model
architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on
reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.
Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected
benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that
harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

TL;DR: 提出CurES方法，通过强化学习梯度优化视角改进大语言模型推理任务的训练效率，重点关注提示选择和rollout数量分配两个关键因素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有课程学习方法未能充分考虑提示难度变化或依赖简单过滤机制，导致显著计算浪费，需要从梯度优化角度系统提升训练效率

Method: 基于理论分析提出CurES方法，优化提示采样分布和rollout数量分配，使用贝叶斯后验估计最小化计算开销

Result: 在1.5B和7B模型上分别比GRPO方法提升3.30和4.82个点，且收敛速度更快

Conclusion: 从梯度优化角度系统分析训练效率影响因素，提出的CurES方法在性能和收敛速度上均优于基线方法

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency
of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods
often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on
simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow
criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we
approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient
optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to
improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors
influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the
allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the
convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout
quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates.
Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that
accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize
computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and
\textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally,
CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

TL;DR: 提出了Gated X-TFC方法，通过可学习的软域分解解决PINNs在边界层问题中的梯度分辨率不足问题，显著提高计算效率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs和相关方法在处理奇异摄动边界值问题时难以解析尖锐梯度，而X-TFC虽然避免了多目标优化但计算效率低且不兼容域分解。

Method: 使用可微分的逻辑门进行软域分解，动态调整径向基函数核宽度，无需界面惩罚；引入算子条件元学习层学习PDE参数到最优门配置的概率映射。

Result: 在1D对流-扩散基准测试中，Gated X-TFC比标准X-TFC误差降低一个数量级，使用80%更少的配点，训练时间减少66%；可扩展到多子域和高维问题。

Conclusion: Gated X-TFC为PINNs提供了一个简单、准确且计算高效的替代方案，特别适用于具有挑战性的边界层问题。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to
resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without
resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex
interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC)
avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition
enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and
incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for
both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a
soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a
differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function
(RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface
penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic
improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D)
convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error
than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and
reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an
operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping
from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast,
uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further
demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving
a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian
source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs
that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging
boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大语言模型训练范式从静态数据集转向基于经验的学习，需要专门的环境模拟器来支持智能体在复杂环境中获取技能。

Method: 开发GEM框架，包括异步向量化执行、灵活包装器、多样化环境套件，并与五种流行的RL训练框架集成。使用ReBN方法进行基线测试，并对PPO、GRPO和REINFORCE进行对比分析。

Result: GEM提供了24个环境的基线结果，ReBN方法在完整RL设置中表现优于GRPO，具有更好的信用分配能力。通过GEM对三种算法在单轮和多轮设置中进行了公平比较。

Conclusion: GEM框架能够加速未来智能体LLM研究，既可作为训练环境，也可作为便捷的评估工具包。

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

TL;DR: 论文研究了秘密诱导技术，旨在发现AI拥有但未明确表达的知识。通过在三个大型语言模型家族中植入特定知识，并测试多种黑盒和白盒诱导方法，发现预填充攻击在2/3场景中最有效，而白盒方法在剩余场景中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI系统拥有但不愿直接透露的秘密知识，这对于AI安全审计和透明度至关重要。当AI被训练在某些情境下应用知识却在直接询问时否认，需要开发有效的诱导技术来揭示这些隐藏信息。

Method: 训练三个LLM家族使其拥有特定知识但在直接询问时否认；设计多种黑盒（预填充攻击）和白盒（logit lens、稀疏自编码器）诱导技术；通过LLM审计员能否成功猜测秘密知识来评估效果。

Result: 多数技术优于简单基线；预填充攻击在2/3场景中最有效；在剩余场景中，基于logit lens和稀疏自编码器的白盒技术表现最佳；建立了公开基准用于评估秘密诱导方法。

Conclusion: 成功开发了有效的秘密诱导技术，预填充攻击作为黑盒方法在多数情况下表现优异，而白盒方法在某些特定场景中更有效。研究为AI安全审计提供了重要工具和评估基准。

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but
does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large
language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream
but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an
LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female,
while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various
black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based
on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret
knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most
effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill
attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when
generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting,
white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are
most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark
for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Abstract: Preprint Note: This is the author preprint version of a paper accepted for
presentation at the IISE Annual Conference & Expo 2025. The final version will
appear in the official proceedings.
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working-age
adults, and current diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams and
specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in
early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We
propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using
routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and
internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as
accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are
aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking
strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics,
and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The
model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision
0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN
baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and
interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its
rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and
robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning
method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even
continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for
handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch
is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics
to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the
overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered
the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This
study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic
reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,
including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration
with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics
using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill
factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded
estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a
well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic
based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the
proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the
validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is
of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this
task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems.
The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise
time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and
supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of
autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated
and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing
interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the
deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在神经多元回归中，与分类任务中神经坍缩有益不同，回归任务中的坍缩会损害性能。通过内在维度分析发现，坍缩模型的特征维度小于目标维度(ID_H < ID_Y)，导致过度压缩和泛化能力差，而非坍缩模型通常保持ID_H > ID_Y。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经多元回归在控制、机器人和金融等领域广泛应用，但其学习表示的几何特性仍不清楚。虽然神经坍缩在分类中被证明有益于泛化，但作者发现回归中的类似坍缩会持续降低性能。

Method: 通过内在维度分析，估计最后一层特征的内在维度(ID_H)并与回归目标的内在维度(ID_Y)进行比较。在控制任务和合成数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 坍缩模型表现出ID_H < ID_Y，导致过度压缩和泛化能力差；非坍缩模型通常保持ID_H > ID_Y。性能与ID_H的关系取决于数据量和噪声水平。识别出过度压缩和压缩不足两种状态。

Conclusion: 研究为神经回归提供了新的几何见解，并提出了增强泛化能力的实用策略：根据数据特征调整特征维度，避免过度压缩或压缩不足。

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as
control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations
remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit
generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression
consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models
through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic
datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and
compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit
ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas
non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed
models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise
levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and
under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature
dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights
into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型缺乏处理非结构化上下文信息、回答领域特定问题和生成自然语言解释的能力，而LLM虽然擅长上下文推理和知识整合，但对数值时间序列处理效率低下且预训练时接触时间序列数据有限。

Method: 使用基于补丁的编码器-解码器架构增强LLM，在包含200多万个交错时间序列和文本示例的大规模语料库上进行训练，涵盖多种分析任务。

Result: TsLLM在需要时间序列分析与自然语言整合的任务上表现出色，虽然不旨在超越传统基准测试中的专门模型，但提供了现有方法无法实现的能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了时间序列分析的新范式，弥合了数值计算和自然语言理解之间的差距，通过自然语言交互使复杂的时间推理能力民主化。

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains
including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing
this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information,
answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language
explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to
their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical
time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure
to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM
with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder
architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus
of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse
analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series
question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language
outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both
its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities.
While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks,
TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of
time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing
approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series
analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding,
democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural
language interaction.

Motivation: 生物特征数据敏感，集中式训练存在隐私风险。联邦学习虽然提供隐私保护替代方案，但传统FL在处理异构数据和非独立同分布数据时存在困难，且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 在中央服务器添加注意力机制，根据重要性加权本地模型更新；使用差分隐私和安全更新协议保护数据；采用Siamese-CNN提取指纹特征；在FVC2004指纹数据集上进行评估。

Result: A3-FL框架在准确率、收敛速度和鲁棒性方面优于标准FL（FedAvg）和静态基线方法。注意力方法准确率达0.8413，FedAvg为0.8164，本地方法为0.7664，集中式方法为0.7997。即使使用差分隐私，准确率仍保持在0.8330。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一个可扩展且隐私敏感的生物特征系统，可在分布式环境中实现安全有效的识别。

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy
risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary
applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,
provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble
with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle
non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the
central server that weights local model updates according to their
significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data
while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using
FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client
contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global
model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework
are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according
to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of
the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and
Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy
stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and
privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in
dispersed environments is presented in this work.

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂时间序列数据推理开辟了新可能性，证明了RL驱动的CoT推理在时间序列领域的有效性。

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning
capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and
weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including
counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and
multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot
explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models
(LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through
reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on
mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance
on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical
Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT
reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards.
Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity
discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary.
COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on
time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by
Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using
prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing
final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with
intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across
various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and
medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to
capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data
when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders
accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these
challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature
representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying
a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving
their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in
the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid
features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between
sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence
relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid
feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in
capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification
accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种并行蒸馏精炼(PDR)推理方法，通过并行生成草稿、蒸馏到有限工作空间、然后精炼的方式，在保持准确率的同时降低上下文长度和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理训练促使LLMs生成长思维链，虽然提高了准确率但增加了上下文长度、计算成本和延迟。研究目标是探索能否利用元认知找到帕累托前沿上的其他组合，比如在更低上下文长度和延迟下获得更好准确率。

Method: 提出了并行蒸馏精炼(PDR)方法：1) 并行生成多样化草稿；2) 蒸馏到有限文本工作空间；3) 基于工作空间进行精炼。当并行度为1时成为顺序精炼(SR)。还训练了8B思维模型与PDR推理方法保持一致。

Result: PDR实例在数学任务上比长思维链获得更高准确率且延迟更低。在AIME 2024上提升11%，AIME 2025上提升9%。顺序精炼(SR)也优于长思维链。

Conclusion: 迭代推理管道在匹配顺序预算下超越单次推理基线，PDR带来最大收益。成功表明进一步训练可能改变帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long
CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with
self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,
token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage
their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,
e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we
view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a
continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family
Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate
diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual
workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output
that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is
controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the
total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current
models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.
Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential
Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides
performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises
the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this
end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it
consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable
answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched
sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME
2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了训练大型语言模型作为多轮强化学习代理的关键设计选择，将设计空间分解为环境、奖励和策略三个支柱，并在TextWorld、ALFWorld和SWE-Gym等任务上进行了实证研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练框架和定义分散，缺乏对多轮强化学习中哪些设计选择真正重要的系统分析和统一表述。

Method: 将设计空间分解为环境、奖励和策略三个支柱，在TextWorld、ALFWorld和SWE-Gym等任务上进行实证研究，分析任务复杂度、奖励稀疏度、策略梯度方法等关键因素。

Result: 发现简单环境可预测复杂任务泛化能力；密集奖励加速训练但性能稳定性依赖RL算法选择；奖励稀疏度与策略梯度方法存在交互作用；找到了最优的SFT到RL训练比例。

Conclusion: 提炼出跨三个支柱协同设计的训练配方，促进多轮代理强化学习的研究和实践工作。

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

TL;DR: 提出Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL)，一种轻量级强化学习算法，通过学习的价值模型选择中等难度提示来后训练语言模型，在推理任务上实现性能与效率的更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练LLM通过强化学习对批处理和提示选择策略仍然敏感，需要找到平衡生成效率和梯度质量的方法，并关注中等难度提示对策略的重要性。

Method: 设计PCL算法，使用并发更新的价值模型以在线方式识别当前策略的中等难度提示，通过关注产生高有效比的信息性提示来优化训练。

Result: 相比基于rollout的过滤方法，PCL在MATH和DeepScaleR数据集上分别实现12.1倍和16.9倍的提示识别速度提升，且达到最高性能或显著减少达到可比性能所需时间。

Conclusion: PCL提供了一种新方法，在推理导向的强化学习中实现了上界性能与效率之间的改进权衡，价值模型能准确预测提示难度并引导关注逐渐更具挑战性的提示。

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

TL;DR: TabINR是一个基于隐式神经表示(INR)的表格数据填补框架，通过可学习的行和特征嵌入来处理离散的表格结构，能够从部分观测中进行自适应填补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界表格数据经常不完整，简单填补策略会引入偏差或扭曲数据分布，需要高质量、鲁棒且快速推理的填补方法。

Method: 使用自解码器架构的隐式神经表示框架，引入可学习的行和特征嵌入来处理表格数据的离散结构，支持从部分观测中推断嵌入实现自适应填补。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集和多种缺失机制下评估，表现出稳定的高填补准确率，在大多数情况下匹配或优于传统方法(KNN、MICE、MissForest)和深度学习方法(GAIN、ReMasker)，在高维数据集上优势最明显。

Conclusion: TabINR框架在表格数据填补任务中表现出色，特别是对于高维数据集，提供了一种有效的自适应填补解决方案。

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet
real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy
restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or
hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing
strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution,
we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across
dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an
auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models
tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs,
we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with
the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial
observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the
trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve
real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating
consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming
classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN,
ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机矩阵理论的梯度去噪后处理算法，用于提高差分隐私微调语言模型的样本效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD在提供强隐私保证的同时，添加的噪声会破坏梯度矩阵的低秩结构，显著增加熵值并降低优化效率

Method: 利用随机矩阵理论对梯度进行后处理去噪，恢复低秩结构并改善与原始信号的对齐

Result: 在GLUE任务上对RoBERTa进行DP-SGD微调时，相比现有方法提高了样本效率，在不需要最优性能时显著减少训练时间

Conclusion: 矩阵恢复技术可以在不损害隐私保证的前提下，提升私有语言模型训练的实用性

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides
strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy
of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing
optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random
matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve
alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on
GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is
not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can
enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising
privacy guarantees.

Motivation: 传统最优传输方法计算复杂，需要数值积分和对抗训练，希望开发更高效、理论保证的框架。

Method: 基于Hamilton-Jacobi方程，利用特征线方法推导闭式双向传输映射，采用纯最小化框架训练单一神经网络，损失函数来自HJ方程特征线方法。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明该方法具有高精度、可扩展性和效率，支持多种成本函数和类条件传输。

Conclusion: 该方法为最优传输应用提供了理论保证的通用工具，具有可证明的最优性。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems
based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely
characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we
derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need
for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization
framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from
the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees
convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages,
thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the
framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports
class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method,
establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with
provable optimality.

Motivation: 在只有离散时间点采样观测数据的情况下，建模动态过程并推断潜在轨迹是一个重要但困难的任务。现有多边际轨迹推断算法存在局限性，需要新的方法来更好地拟合观测分布。

Method: 使用GAN启发的对抗性损失来拟合源点和目标点之间的神经参数化插值曲线，确保中间时间点的边际分布接近观测分布，然后通过流匹配算法对插值进行边际化，得到训练好的向量场。

Result: 在空间转录组学和细胞追踪数据集上表现优于现有基线方法，在单细胞轨迹预测任务上与现有方法表现相当。插值曲线在温和假设下具有唯一性。

Conclusion: ALI-CFM方法具有多功能性和可扩展性，能够有效解决多边际轨迹推断问题，为动态过程建模提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time
points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When
no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data
taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus
inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal
generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow
matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal
trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a
GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves
between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at
intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting
interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild
assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow
matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying
dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by
outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell
tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory
prediction.

TL;DR: M2PO是一种异步强化学习方法，通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，在高度陈旧数据下实现稳定训练，性能与在线训练相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖在线训练，效率低且扩展性差；异步RL系统虽然解耦了数据生成和训练，但在处理陈旧数据时性能会下降或崩溃。

Method: 提出M2PO方法，通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新，在高陈旧度下显著减少被裁剪的token比例。

Result: 在6个模型（1.7B到32B）和8个基准测试上的广泛评估显示，M2PO能在数据陈旧至少256个模型更新的情况下实现稳定训练，性能与在线训练相当。

Conclusion: M2PO证明了陈旧数据如果被适当利用，可以像在线数据一样具有信息性，为高效可扩展的强化学习训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language
model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands
fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability.
Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from
training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in
rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or
collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse
phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited
properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust
Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights
to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.
Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high
staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance
tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six
models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable
off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and
matches on-policy performance.

Conclusion: 控制预训练分布的关键统计特性对于构建具有上下文学习能力和可靠性的大型语言模型至关重要。

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs)
remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models
to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve
these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the
pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical
tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and
generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how
distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and
robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and
concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better
reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how
ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks
such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory.
Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of
the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable
LLMs.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and
practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are
essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data
is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of
various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning
models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can
mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques
for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their
performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data
on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine
learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that
the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria
listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely
mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close
to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore,
models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world
data.

Result: WN方法实现了线性收敛，迭代复杂度和样本复杂度随着过参数化程度的增加而多项式级改善，相比标准方法获得指数级加速。

Conclusion: 这是首个刻画WN如何利用过参数化实现矩阵感知问题更快收敛的理论工作，为理解归一化技术的理论优势提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

Conclusion: COM-BOM能够有效平衡预测准确性和模型校准，为可信赖的上下文学习提供了实用的示例选择方法

Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of
in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize
for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key
determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate
exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly
targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of
expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient
Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto
front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.
We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and
find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two
objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

Method: 提出BroRL方法，将每个样本的rollout数量增加到数百个，进行充分广泛的探索。基于质量平衡方程分析，证明随着rollout数量增加，未采样项的影响会减弱，确保正确token概率质量的扩展。

Result: BroRL能够复活在3K步ProRL训练后饱和的模型，实现稳健的持续改进，在1.5B模型上跨多个基准测试达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: 增加rollout数量是强化学习扩展的有效互补策略，能够突破训练步数扩展的性能瓶颈，实现持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种控制去噪扩散和流匹配模型采样多样性的机制，允许用户从比训练分布更尖锐或更宽的分布中采样，无需微调或改变训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型缺乏对采样多样性的灵活控制，用户无法根据需要调整生成样本的多样性程度。

Method: 通过重新缩放噪声数据分布的（学习到的）得分函数来控制局部采样温度，该方法兼容确定性和随机性采样器。

Result: 在2D玩具数据和五个不同任务（图像生成、姿态估计、深度预测、机器人操作、蛋白质设计）上验证有效，能够从更尖锐或更平坦的分布中采样。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的采样多样性控制机制，在不同任务中都能带来性能提升，且兼容现成的预训练模型。

Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion
and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader
distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that
these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for
sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a
`local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any
finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any
off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic
samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate
its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks --
image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and
protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling
from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth
prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas
image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter
distribution. Project page: https://temporalscorerescaling.github.io

TL;DR: 提出Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL)方法，通过匹配专家分配与目标Dirichlet先验来直接塑造路由概率分布，解决了预训练密集模型升级为稀疏MoE时专家专业化不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练密集模型升级为稀疏MoE时，由于简单的权重复制导致专家专业化不足，即使使用传统正则化方法，路由仍然表现出低置信度和弱区分度，限制了性能提升。

Method: 引入DPSL路由器正则化技术，通过将专家分配与目标Dirichlet先验匹配来直接塑造路由概率分布，提供对专家平衡和专业化的细粒度控制，并能编码归纳偏置。

Result: 在升级的MoE视觉语言模型（使用Qwen2、Phi3、Llama3.2 LLM骨干）上的实验表明，DPSL在标准视觉语言基准测试中持续优于其他升级策略和正则化技术。

Conclusion: DPSL解决了专家专业化不足的关键问题，促进了更自适应、更高性能的模型，且作为通用工具可应用于任何输出分类概率分布的模块。

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs)
efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert
specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that
upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,
weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce
Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique
that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert
assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over
expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases
such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without
requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to
any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its
utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models
(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms
upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard
vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor
specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.
