*Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo,Moinul Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHANTOM框架利用变形艺术制作视角依赖的对抗样本，在无需模型访问的黑盒设置下攻击自动驾驶车辆视觉系统，成功率高达90%，并能通过V2X通信引发网络级安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自动驾驶车辆依赖视觉DNN和V2X通信，但这些系统仍易受物理对抗攻击。现有攻击方法存在局限性，需要探索更隐蔽、更有效的攻击方式。

Method: 利用变形艺术原理制作视角依赖的对抗样本，通过几何变形产生对人类自然但对检测器致命的图像。在无需模型访问的黑盒设置下，针对四种检测器架构进行攻击。

Result: 在CARLA仿真中，PHANTOM在理想条件下攻击成功率超过90%，恶劣环境下仍保持60-80%效果。攻击在6-10米内激活，SUMO-OMNeT++仿真显示虚假紧急消息通过V2X传播，信息峰值年龄增加68-89%。

Conclusion: PHANTOM暴露了CAV生态系统在感知和通信层的严重漏洞，变形艺术攻击能有效欺骗检测器并引发网络级安全风险，需要新的防御机制来应对此类威胁。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

TL;DR: 利用预训练视频扩散模型从单张运动模糊图像恢复完整视频序列，揭示拍摄时刻及前后场景动态


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动模糊图像虽然损失细节，但编码了曝光期间场景和相机的运动信息。现有方法依赖手工先验或特定网络架构，无法处理复杂场景动态，且不能恢复拍摄前后的信息。

Method: 提出新方法，利用在互联网规模数据集上预训练的视频扩散模型，从单张运动模糊图像恢复揭示复杂场景动态的视频序列，包括拍摄时刻及前后时间的信息。

Result: 方法在恢复视频质量上优于现有技术，能泛化到具有挑战性的真实场景图像，并支持相机轨迹、物体运动和动态3D场景结构等下游任务。

Conclusion: 通过利用大规模预训练视频扩散模型，能够从单张运动模糊图像中恢复出包含复杂场景动态的完整视频序列，突破了传统方法的局限。

Abstract: We seek to answer the question: what can a motion-blurred image reveal about a scene's past, present, and future? Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于视频扩散模型的后处理重对焦方法，可从单张失焦图像生成感知准确的对焦堆栈视频序列，实现交互式重对焦


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动对焦系统经常无法捕捉到预期主体，用户希望在拍摄后调整对焦，但现有方法有限

Method: 使用视频扩散模型，从单张失焦图像生成对焦堆栈视频序列，并发布了大规模真实世界智能手机条件下的对焦堆栈数据集

Result: 在感知质量和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法，特别是在具有挑战性的场景中表现优异

Conclusion: 该方法为日常摄影中更先进的对焦编辑功能铺平了道路，代码和数据已开源

Abstract: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

### [4] [RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19850)
*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了RANSAC中几何模型评分函数问题，发现当前最优方法MAGSAC++的推导存在问题，其评分函数实际上等价于简单的高斯-均匀似然模型，且所有评分函数在实验中都表现相同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视RANSAC中几何模型评分函数这一关键组件，分析当前最优方法MAGSAC++的理论基础，并建立统一的评分函数理论框架。

Method: 1) 扩展几何误差到球面噪声；2) 建立混合模型（均匀分布异常值）和阈值参数化，统一似然基和鲁棒M估计器；3) 分析MAGSAC++的理论推导问题；4) 提出新的实验评估方法（大验证集或小随机验证集期望）。

Result: 1) MAGSAC++的推导不符合合理原则，其评分函数数值上等价于简单高斯-均匀似然模型；2) 所有评分函数（包括学习的内点分布）在实验中表现相同；3) MAGSAC++既不优于简单竞争者，也不对阈值超参数选择更不敏感。

Conclusion: 本文全面重新审视了当前最先进的评分函数方法，揭示了MAGSAC++的理论缺陷，为未来改进方法或应用于其他鲁棒拟合问题提供了重要参考。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

### [5] [HyGE-Occ: Hybrid View-Transformation with 3D Gaussian and Edge Priors for 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19871)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGE-Occ：一种利用3D高斯和边缘先验的混合视图变换分支，提升3D全景占用预测的几何一致性和边界感知能力的新框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D全景占用预测方法在保持精确几何结构和捕捉3D实例空间范围方面存在困难，这影响了全景分离的鲁棒性

Method: 提出HyGE-Occ框架，采用混合视图变换分支，融合连续高斯深度表示和离散深度仓公式，同时从BEV特征提取边缘图作为辅助信息学习边缘线索

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，HyGE-Occ优于现有方法，展现出卓越的3D几何推理能力

Conclusion: HyGE-Occ通过结合3D高斯和边缘先验的混合方法，有效提升了3D全景占用预测的几何一致性和边界感知，为精细的3D场景理解提供了新方案

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

### [6] [Widget2Code: From Visual Widgets to UI Code via Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19918)
*Houston H. Zhang,Tao Zhang,Baoze Lin,Yuanqi Xue,Yincheng Zhu,Huan Liu,Li Gu,Linfeng Ye,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Yuanhao Yu,Zhixiang Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Widget2Code任务，针对紧凑型小部件界面生成代码，建立首个图像基准并开发WidgetFactory系统，显著提升视觉保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UI2Code研究主要关注网页和移动界面，而小部件（widgets）作为紧凑、无上下文、图标密集的微界面被忽视，且缺乏公开标注数据

Method: 1) 建立图像基准和细粒度评估指标；2) 开发WidgetFactory系统：包括WidgetDSL领域特定语言、编译器、图标检索、自适应渲染模块；3) 基于设计原则将原子组件组装为完整布局

Result: 通用MLLMs优于专用UI2Code方法但仍不可靠，提出的WidgetFactory系统显著提升视觉保真度，为Widget2Code研究建立强基准和统一基础设施

Conclusion: Widget2Code是UI2Code的重要新方向，提出的基准和WidgetFactory系统解决了小部件特有的紧凑性、图标密集等挑战，为未来研究奠定基础

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeurAlign是一个深度学习框架，通过统一的体积-表面表示联合配准大脑MRI的皮层和皮层下区域，在准确性和速度上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将体积和表面配准分开处理，导致不一致性，限制了神经科学研究的跨被试分析。需要一种能够同时配准大脑皮层和皮层下区域的统一方法。

Method: 提出NeurAlign框架，利用中间球面坐标空间桥接解剖表面拓扑和体积解剖结构，将球面配准整合到学习中，确保体积和表面域之间的几何一致性。

Result: 在域内和域外数据集上，NeurAlign在Dice分数上比经典和机器学习方法提高最多7个点，同时保持规则变形场，速度比标准方法快几个数量级。

Conclusion: NeurAlign以其优越的准确性、快速推理和易用性，为联合皮层和皮层下配准设定了新标准，只需MRI扫描无需额外输入。

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

### [8] [Vehicle-centric Perception via Multimodal Structured Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19934)
*Wentao Wu,Xiao Wang,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VehicleMAE-V2是一个车辆中心预训练大模型，通过整合车辆对称性、轮廓和语义三种结构化先验知识来指导掩码令牌重建，显著提升车辆感知的表征学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在预训练阶段缺乏对车辆相关知识的有效学习，导致车辆感知表征建模能力不足。需要一种能够学习通用车辆感知表征的预训练模型。

Method: 提出VehicleMAE-V2模型，设计三个模块：对称性引导掩码模块（SMM）利用车辆对称约束选择高质量掩码图像块；轮廓引导表征模块（CRM）通过最小化轮廓特征与重建特征的概率分布差异来保持整体车辆结构信息；语义引导表征模块（SRM）通过对比学习和跨模态蒸馏对齐图像-文本特征。构建了包含400万车辆图像和12,693文本描述的大规模数据集Autobot4M进行预训练。

Result: 在五个下游任务上的广泛实验表明VehicleMAE-V2具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过整合车辆相关的结构化先验知识，VehicleMAE-V2能够学习到更通用、更有效的车辆感知表征，为车辆中心感知任务提供了强大的预训练基础。

Abstract: Vehicle-centric perception plays a crucial role in many intelligent systems, including large-scale surveillance systems, intelligent transportation, and autonomous driving. Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2.

### [9] [Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941)
*Mozes Jacobs,Thomas Fel,Richard Hakim,Alessandra Brondetta,Demba Ba,T. Andy Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) 表现出块循环深度结构，仅需少量不同块循环应用即可近似原始模型，支持通过动力学系统分析研究ViT


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Vision Transformers成为标准视觉骨干网络，需要从机制上解释其计算现象学。尽管架构暗示了动力学结构，但缺乏将Transformer深度解释为特征化流的框架。

Method: 提出块循环假设(BRH)，认为训练好的ViT具有块循环深度结构。开发Raptor模型（循环近似相位结构Transformer），通过训练块循环代理来验证假设。使用层间表示相似性矩阵分析相位结构。

Result: 1) 小规模实验中，随机深度和训练促进循环结构；2) Raptor仅用2个块即可恢复DINOv2 ImageNet-1k线性探测96%准确率；3) 发现方向收敛到类依赖角盆地、token特定动力学、晚期深度低秩更新等动力学特性。

Conclusion: ViT深度中出现紧凑的循环程序，指向低复杂度规范解，使这些模型能够通过原理性动力学系统分析进行研究。

Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SE360：一个用于360度全景图多条件引导物体编辑的新框架，通过粗到细的自主数据生成和两阶段数据精炼策略，训练基于Transformer的扩散模型实现文本、掩码或参考图像引导的灵活编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的图像编辑方法扩展到360度全景图时面临挑战，在等距柱状投影和透视视图中经常产生不合理的结果，需要专门针对全景图的编辑解决方案。

Method: 提出SE360框架，核心是无需人工干预的粗到细自主数据生成流水线，利用视觉语言模型和自适应投影调整进行分层分析；引入经济高效的两阶段数据精炼策略；基于构建的数据集训练基于Transformer的扩散模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量和语义准确性方面均优于现有方法，能够生成语义上有意义且几何一致的结果。

Conclusion: SE360成功解决了360度全景图编辑的挑战，通过创新的数据生成和精炼策略，实现了灵活、高质量的多条件引导物体编辑。

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

Motivation: 研究视频基础模型是否能在大量视频数据预训练后自然获得3D理解能力，量化现有模型的3D感知水平。

Method: 提出首个模型无关框架，通过浅层读出器从视频基础模型特征中估计多种3D属性，测量不同模型的3D感知能力。

Result: 最先进的视频生成模型展现出对3D物体和场景的强理解能力，尽管未经过任何3D数据训练，在某些方面甚至超过专门训练的3D专家模型。

Conclusion: 视频基础模型通过大规模视频预训练能够获得显著的3D理解能力，这为构建可扩展的3D模型提供了有价值的观察和基准。

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

TL;DR: HistoWAS是一个计算框架，通过整合30个拓扑和空间特征来量化组织微结构，并将组织空间组织与临床结果关联起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏能够测量个体结构特征空间相互作用及其与临床参数关联的工具，限制了组织微环境和宏观环境特征在临床研究中的应用。

Method: 1) 构建特征空间：在传统指标基础上增加30个来自地理信息系统点模式分析的拓扑和空间特征；2) 关联研究引擎：采用类似表型全基因组关联研究的方法，对每个特征进行大规模单变量回归并进行统计校正。

Result: 在KPMP项目的385张PAS染色全切片图像上应用HistoWAS，分析了102个特征（72个传统对象级特征+30个空间特征），代码和数据已开源。

Conclusion: HistoWAS框架能够有效连接组织空间组织与临床结果，为组织病理学的高通量分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

### [13] [WSD-MIL: Window Scale Decay Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19982)
*Le Feng,Li Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出WSD-MIL方法，通过窗口尺度衰减注意力机制和区域门控模块，解决计算病理学中多实例学习的计算复杂度和多尺度肿瘤区域建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法主要关注特征提取器和聚合策略，忽略了全切片图像中实例间的复杂语义关系。Transformer-based MIL方法虽然试图建模实例依赖，但二次计算复杂度限制了其在大规模WSI上的可扩展性。此外，不同WSI中肿瘤区域尺度变化显著，固定尺度注意力机制难以精确捕捉局部实例相关性，且未考虑基于距离的补丁相关性衰减效应。

Method: 提出WSD-MIL方法，包含两个核心模块：1) 窗口尺度衰减注意力模块，采用基于聚类的采样策略降低计算成本，同时逐步衰减注意力窗口尺度以捕捉不同尺度的局部实例关系；2) 基于挤压-激励的区域门控模块，动态调整窗口权重以增强全局信息建模。

Result: 在CAMELYON16和TCGA-BRCA数据集上达到最先进性能，同时减少了62%的计算内存消耗。

Conclusion: WSD-MIL能够有效建模不同尺度的肿瘤区域，同时提高计算效率，为计算病理学中的多实例学习提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

TL;DR: DDTM提出了一种双分支弱监督框架，通过扩散分支进行局部语义细化，Transformer分支进行全局上下文推理，解决跨分辨率土地覆盖映射中的分辨率不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨分辨率土地覆盖映射需要从粗分辨率监督中生成高分辨率语义预测，但严重的分辨率不匹配使得有效学习极具挑战性。现有弱监督方法难以将细粒度空间结构与粗标签对齐，导致噪声监督和映射精度下降。

Method: DDTM采用双分支框架：1）基于扩散的分支在粗监督下逐步细化细尺度局部语义；2）基于Transformer的分支在大空间范围内强制执行长距离上下文一致性；3）伪标签置信度评估模块缓解跨分辨率不一致性引起的噪声，选择性利用可靠的监督信号。

Result: 在Chesapeake Bay基准测试中，DDTM实现了66.52%的mIoU，显著优于先前的弱监督方法，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DDTM通过解耦局部语义细化和全局上下文推理，有效解决了跨分辨率土地覆盖映射中的分辨率不匹配问题，为弱监督高分辨率语义预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

TL;DR: 提出MIVA模块化图像到视频适配器，通过轻量子网络学习单一运动模式，仅需少量样本训练，实现精确运动控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像动画应用受限，主要因为视频信号维度高导致训练数据稀缺，模型倾向于记忆而非遵循提示，且难以泛化到未见运动模式

Method: 提出MIVA模块化图像到视频适配器，轻量子网络可附加到预训练扩散模型，每个模块学习单一运动模式，支持并行扩展，仅需约10个样本在消费级GPU上训练

Result: MIVA实现更精确的运动控制，同时保持甚至超越在更大数据集上训练模型的生成质量，无需提示工程

Conclusion: MIVA有效解决了扩散模型在图像动画中的局限性，通过模块化设计实现高效运动模式学习与控制

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved impressive photorealism in image and video generation. However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets.

Abstract: Automated pavement defect detection often struggles to generalize across diverse real-world conditions due to the lack of standardized datasets. Existing datasets differ in annotation styles, distress type definitions, and formats, limiting their integration for unified training. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset that consolidates multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection of 52747 images from seven countries, with 135277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distinct distress types. The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions, offering a unique resource for consistent training and evaluation. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through benchmarking with state-of-the-art object detection models including YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, which achieved competitive performance across diverse scenarios. By standardizing class definitions and annotation formats, this dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection and enables fair comparison of models, including zero-shot transfer to new environments.

<details>

Motivation: 当前模型只能处理简单的单目标指令，但在面对复杂地理空间场景时失败，如多粒度分割、多目标指令和隐含用户意图理解。现有数据集过于简化，导致模型在实际应用中敏感易错。

Method: 1. 创建LaSeRS大规模数据集，涵盖语言引导分割的四个关键维度；2. 提出SegEarth-R2 MLLM架构，包含空间注意力监督机制处理小物体定位，以及灵活高效的分割查询机制处理单目标和多目标场景。

Result: SegEarth-R2在LaSeRS和其他基准测试中表现出色，为下一代地理空间分割建立了强大的基线。

Conclusion: LaSeRS数据集和SegEarth-R2模型填补了复杂地理空间推理的关键空白，推动了遥感图像中语言引导分割技术的发展。

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation. All data and code will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-R2.

TL;DR: 双视角（驾驶员+道路）输入在某些模型上能提升分心驾驶检测精度，但效果取决于架构设计，不当融合反而会降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分心驾驶检测模型仅依赖驾驶员视角，忽略了影响驾驶行为的重要环境上下文。本研究探讨结合道路视角是否能提升自然驾驶条件下的检测精度。

Method: 使用真实驾驶中的同步双摄像头数据，在三种时空动作识别架构（SlowFast-R50、X3D-M、SlowOnly-R50）上比较单视角（驾驶员）和双视角堆叠输入的检测性能。

Result: 单路径SlowOnly模型在双视角输入下精度提升9.8%，而双路径SlowFast模型精度下降7.2%，表明简单添加视觉上下文可能因表征冲突导致干扰。

Conclusion: 单纯增加视觉上下文不足以提升性能，不当融合反而会降低准确性。未来多模态驾驶员监控系统需要专门支持多视角融合的架构设计。

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

Motivation: 当前图神经网络在多模态医疗诊断中通常依赖单一静态图，该图基于不加区分的特征构建，限制了建模患者特异性病理关系的能力

Method: 提出多激活平面交互图神经网络(MAPI-GNN)：1) 通过多维判别器发现潜在图感知模式；2) 基于这些模式动态构建激活图堆栈；3) 通过关系融合引擎聚合和情境化多面配置文件进行诊断

Conclusion: MAPI-GNN通过重构单图范式，从语义解耦的特征子空间学习多面图配置文件，能够更好地建模患者特异性病理关系，提升多模态医疗诊断的鲁棒性

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: H2em：通过双曲几何学习层次化嵌入的CZS新框架，利用双曲空间的树状结构特性，结合双层次蕴含损失和判别对齐损失，在闭世界和开世界场景均达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CZS方法通常忽略丰富的层次结构（如原始概念的语义层次、原始概念与组合之间的概念层次），少数在欧几里得空间中建模层次的方法无法扩展到现实世界CZS所需的大规模分类体系，因为欧氏空间的体积多项式增长无法匹配层次结构的指数增长，损害了泛化能力。

Method: 提出H2em框架：1）利用双曲几何的自然树状结构嵌入特性；2）设计双层次蕴含损失，使用双曲蕴含锥强制执行预定义层次结构；3）设计判别对齐损失，通过难负样本挖掘在语义相似组合间建立大的测地距离；4）设计双曲跨模态注意力，在双曲几何中实现实例感知的跨模态融合。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛消融实验表明，H2em在闭世界和开世界场景中均建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: H2em通过双曲几何有效建模CZS中的层次结构，解决了欧氏空间无法匹配层次结构指数增长的问题，显著提升了泛化能力，为大规模现实世界CZS应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALLR-Pin：一个两阶段框架，通过结合视觉特征、拼音和语言上下文来改进普通话唇语识别，利用多任务学习和LLM纠错来解决同音字和歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 普通话唇语识别面临两个主要挑战：1）视位（visemes）高度模糊，2）同音字普遍存在。这些因素使得仅从唇部运动准确识别中文字符变得困难。

Method: 1）两阶段框架：共享视频编码器+双解码器（同时预测中文字符序列和标准拼音）；2）多任务学习字符和拼音输出；3）推理时生成多个候选转录，将拼音输出与候选中文序列拼接作为提示输入LLM；4）在合成噪声示例上微调LLM，使其了解模型特定错误模式。

Result: 通过结合视觉特征、拼音和语言上下文，VALLR-Pin提高了普通话唇语识别性能。多任务学习和LLM纠错机制有效解决了同音字和歧义问题。

Conclusion: VALLR-Pin通过协同整合视觉特征与拼音和语言上下文，显著改进了普通话唇语识别性能。该方法为处理高度模糊的视位和普遍存在的同音字提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

Motivation: 现有唇部同步系统通常需要复杂的掩码处理或使用计算密集的生成模型（如GANs或扩散模型），导致推理速度慢且训练不稳定。需要一种既能保持高质量视觉效果，又能实现实时性能的简化方案。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：第一阶段是紧凑的一步潜在空间编辑器，使用参考身份、掩码目标帧和低维唇部姿态向量重建图像，仅使用重建损失训练（无GANs或扩散）。通过自监督生成嘴部变体作为伪真值进行微调，实现无需显式掩码的推理。第二阶段是基于流匹配目标的音频到姿态变换器，从语音预测唇部姿态向量。

Conclusion: FlashLips通过解耦唇部控制和渲染，结合自监督学习和流匹配，实现了高质量、实时、无需掩码的唇部同步，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

Conclusion: 提出的多模态管道通过整合外部文本知识有效增强了图像描述的上下文深度，为需要丰富信息描述的实际应用提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚风格分类具有挑战性，因为同一风格内视觉差异大，且不同风格之间视觉相似度高。风格不仅由整体外观表达，还受单品属性及其组合方式影响。

Method: 提出IRSN网络：1) 使用IRP提取单品区域特征；2) 分别分析各区域特征；3) 通过GFF融合特征；4) 采用双主干架构结合领域特定特征提取器和预训练通用特征提取器。

Result: 在6个主流骨干网络上应用IRSN，在FashionStyle14数据集上平均提升6.9%（最高14.5%），在ShowniqV3数据集上平均提升7.6%（最高15.1%。可视化分析显示IRSN能更好区分相似风格。

Conclusion: IRSN通过分析单品区域特征及其组合，有效提升时尚风格分类性能，双主干架构进一步增强特征表示能力。

Abstract: Fashion style classification is a challenging task because of the large visual variation within the same style and the existence of visually similar styles.
  Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations.
  In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features.
  IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF).
  In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset.
  In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset. Visualization analysis also supports that the IRSN models are better than the baseline models at capturing differences between similar style classes.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了激活函数和优化器组合对基于深度学习的HAR系统性能的影响，发现ConvLSTM结合Adam或RMSprop在医疗相关活动识别中表现最佳，准确率可达99%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在人类活动识别中广泛应用，但激活函数和优化器的组合对性能的影响尚未充分研究，特别是在实际医疗场景中。现有研究多关注架构设计，而AF和MO的交互作用相对未被探索。

Method: 使用三种激活函数（ReLU、Sigmoid、Tanh）和四种优化算法（SGD、Adam、RMSprop、Adagrad）的组合，在两种循环架构（BiLSTM和ConvLSTM）上进行实验。实验基于HMDB51和UCF101数据集中六个医疗相关活动类别。

Result: ConvLSTM始终优于BiLSTM，结合Adam或RMSprop时准确率高达99.00%，表现出强大的时空学习能力和稳定性能。BiLSTM在UCF101上表现尚可（约98.00%），但在HMDB51上降至约60.00%，显示其跨数据集鲁棒性有限且对AF和MO变化敏感度较弱。

Conclusion: 该研究为优化HAR系统提供了实用见解，特别是在需要快速精确活动检测的医疗环境中，ConvLSTM结合Adam或RMSprop是最佳选择。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.

TL;DR: LiDARDraft：利用3D布局作为桥梁，通过语义和深度控制信号，实现从文本、图像等多样化输入生成高质量可控LiDAR点云


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成LiDAR点云时难以同时实现高质量和多样化可控性，主要因为复杂的点云分布与简单控制信号之间的不平衡。需要一种能够从文本描述、图像等任意输入创建自动驾驶环境的方法。

Method: 1. 将文本、图像和点云统一表示为3D布局；2. 将3D布局转换为语义和深度控制信号；3. 使用基于rangemap的ControlNet引导LiDAR点云生成；4. 通过像素级对齐实现可控生成。

Result: 该方法在可控LiDAR点云生成方面表现出色，支持"从零开始模拟"，能够从任意文本描述、图像和草图创建自动驾驶环境。

Conclusion: LiDARDraft通过3D布局桥接多样化条件信号与LiDAR点云，解决了复杂点云分布与简单控制信号之间的不平衡问题，实现了高质量、可控的LiDAR点云生成。

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架成功统一了确定性和随机方法的优势，实现了高质量的新颖视角合成，同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.

TL;DR: 提出多模态注意力网络，融合探地雷达时间模式和热成像空间特征，用于桥面板分层检测，引入不确定性量化，在平衡数据上显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础设施检测技术存在局限性：探地雷达对湿度和浅层缺陷敏感，热成像受天气影响且深度有限。单模态方法存在互补约束，需要融合多模态数据以提高检测性能。

Method: 提出多模态注意力网络，包含：1) 雷达时间注意力处理时间模式；2) 热成像空间注意力处理空间特征；3) 跨模态融合通过可学习嵌入发现互补缺陷模式；4) 通过蒙特卡洛dropout和学习方差估计进行不确定性量化，分解为认知和随机不确定性。

Result: 在五个桥梁数据集上，平衡到中度不平衡数据中，该方法在准确率和AUC上显著优于基线方法，超越单模态和简单拼接融合。跨模态注意力提供关键增益，多头机制改善校准。不确定性量化减少校准误差，支持选择性预测。

Conclusion: 注意力架构在典型场景表现良好，但极端类别不平衡时易受多数类主导。系统保持部署效率，支持实时检测并明确能力边界，为实际应用提供可操作指导。

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

TL;DR: DDAVS提出解耦音频语义和延迟双向对齐框架，解决音频-视觉分割中的多源纠缠和视听错位问题，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视觉分割方法存在多源纠缠和视听错位问题，导致偏向更大或更响的物体，而忽略较弱、较小或共现的声源。

Method: 使用可学习查询提取音频语义，通过音频原型记忆库构建结构化语义空间，结合对比学习增强区分性；引入延迟模态交互的双重交叉注意力机制改善多模态对齐。

Result: 在AVS-Objects和VPO基准测试中持续优于现有方法，在单源、多源和多实例场景下均表现出色，验证了框架的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: DDAVS通过解耦音频语义和延迟双向对齐，有效解决了音频-视觉分割中的关键挑战，在复杂真实场景下展现出强大的性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

*Mohammad Helal Uddin,Liam Seymour,Sabur Baidya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HEART-ViT：首个基于Hessian指导的统一动态注意力与token剪枝框架，通过二阶优化在保持准确率的同时显著降低ViT计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers虽然准确率高，但其二次注意力计算成本和冗余计算严重阻碍在延迟和资源受限平台上的部署。现有剪枝方法单独处理token或注意力头，依赖启发式或一阶信号，往往牺牲准确性或无法跨输入泛化。

Method: 提出HEART-ViT框架，使用高效的Hessian-向量积估计token和注意力头的曲率加权敏感性，在明确损失预算下实现原则性剪枝决策。该方法统一考虑token剪枝（主导计算节省）和注意力头剪枝（提供细粒度冗余移除）。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和ImageNet-1K上，HEART-ViT实现高达49.4%的FLOPs减少、36%延迟降低和46%吞吐量提升，同时微调后保持或超越基线准确率（如40% token剪枝时恢复4.7%准确率）。在AGX Orin等边缘设备上验证了实际推理速度和能效提升。

Conclusion: HEART-ViT填补了理论与实践之间的差距，提供了首个统一、曲率驱动的剪枝框架，既保持准确性又实现边缘高效，为ViT在资源受限平台上的部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园自动化任务面临环境变化大、遮挡严重等挑战，传统苹果姿态估计方法依赖关键点标注，但苹果花萼等关键点常被遮挡，导致标注困难耗时，且不同图像间存在冲突和缺失标注

Method: 提出新流程：1) 使用3D高斯泼溅重建果园场景；2) 简化标注；3) 自动将标注投影到图像；4) 训练和评估姿态估计方法。通过3D重建减少手动标注需求

Result: 仅需105个手动标注即可获得28,191个训练标签（减少99.6%）。训练使用遮挡≤95%的苹果标签效果最佳，原始图像F1分数0.927，渲染图像0.970。训练集大小对性能影响小，遮挡越少位置估计越好，但方向估计仍存在问题

Conclusion: 基于3D重建的自动化标注流程能显著减少果园场景中苹果姿态估计的标注工作量，在位置估计方面表现良好，但方向估计仍需改进

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低样本计数方法存在局限性：基于密度的方法定位能力差，而基于点检测的方法因预训练查询数量有限，在目标密集场景下表现不佳，需要采用上采样和分块等临时技术。需要一种能同时实现准确计数和精确定位的方法。

Conclusion: CoDi通过潜在扩散模型和创新的示例条件化模块，有效解决了低样本目标计数问题，在密集小目标场景下实现了准确的计数和定位，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Low-shot object counting addresses estimating the number of previously unobserved objects in an image using only few or no annotated test-time exemplars. A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community. Datasets and codes will be publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/nianbing/NL-DIR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像压缩方法在像素空间进行变换编码以减少空间冗余，但在低比特率下难以同时实现高真实感与高保真，因为像素空间失真与人类感知不一致。

Method: 1) 在VQ-VAE的生成式潜在空间进行变换编码，该空间具有更高稀疏性、更丰富语义和更好感知对齐；2) 引入分类超模块减少超信息比特成本；3) 基于码字预测的监督增强语义一致性。

Result: 在自然图像上小于0.04 bpp，人脸图像上小于0.01 bpp时仍保持高视觉质量；在CLIC2020测试集上，以比MS-ILLM少45%的比特数达到相同FID；支持图像修复和风格迁移等应用。

Conclusion: 生成式潜在空间编码比像素空间编码更有利于实现低比特率下的高真实感与高保真图像压缩，并为多种图像处理应用提供强大基础。

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer.

TL;DR: JDPNet是一个联合退化处理网络，通过挖掘和统一耦合退化中的潜在信息，有效处理水下图像的多重非线性耦合退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像存在多种退化类型，这些退化呈现非线性耦合而非简单叠加，现有方法大多针对特定退化设计分支或模块，难以有效捕捉和处理多重退化间的非线性交互作用。

Method: 提出JDPNet网络，包含联合特征挖掘模块和概率引导分布策略，用于挖掘和统一调整耦合退化特征；设计AquaBalanceLoss损失函数平衡颜色、清晰度和对比度。

Result: 在6个公开水下数据集和2个新建数据集上实验表明，JDPNet达到最先进性能，并在性能、参数量和计算成本之间取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: JDPNet通过统一框架挖掘耦合退化中的潜在信息，有效处理水下图像的多重非线性退化问题，为水下图像处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

TL;DR: LiteFusion：一种轻量级多模态3D检测器，将LiDAR作为几何信息补充而非独立模态，消除对3D稀疏卷积的依赖，提升部署友好性和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态3D检测器过度依赖LiDAR传感器，在LiDAR缺失时性能大幅下降，且依赖专为NVIDIA GPU优化的3D稀疏卷积算子，难以部署到NPU、FPGA等多样化硬件平台

Method: 重新思考LiDAR在相机-LiDAR融合中的作用，将LiDAR点云作为几何信息补充而非独立模态，在四元数空间中集成LiDAR特征到图像特征，保持正交约束以建模跨模态关系

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，相比基线视觉检测器提升+20.4% mAP和+19.7% NDS，参数量仅增加1.1%；即使在LiDAR输入缺失时仍保持良好性能

Conclusion: LiteFusion通过消除对3D主干的依赖，实现了部署友好的多模态3D检测，在保持高性能的同时增强了系统鲁棒性，适用于多样化融合范式和部署场景

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.

*Oikantik Nath,Sahithi Kukkala,Mitesh Khapra,Ravi Kiran Sarvadevabhatla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicDLP是一个大规模多语言文档布局数据集，涵盖11种印度语言和英语，解决现有数据集在规模、多样性和标注粒度方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档布局数据集存在三个主要问题：1）大规模数据集（如PubLayNet、DocBank）缺乏细粒度区域标签和多语言多样性；2）人工标注数据集（如M6Doc、D4LA）标签丰富但规模太小，缺乏多语言覆盖；3）印度语言文档在现有数据集中代表性不足，限制了文档理解的发展。

Method: 构建IndicDLP数据集，涵盖11种代表性印度语言和英语，覆盖12个常见文档领域。同时创建UED-mini数据集（基于DocLayNet和M6Doc）用于预训练。通过微调现有英语模型在IndicDLP上验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，在IndicDLP上微调现有英语模型能显著提升性能。此外，在IndicDLP上训练的模型能够很好地泛化到非印度语言文档布局，证明其作为文档数字化资源的价值。

Conclusion: IndicDLP填补了文档布局分析在规模、多样性和标注粒度方面的空白，推动了包容性和高效的文档理解，特别为印度语言文档的数字化提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DAMP框架，通过空间-光谱退化度量作为退化提示，无需预定义退化先验，实现统一高光谱图像恢复，在多种退化条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一高光谱图像恢复方法依赖显式退化先验（如退化标签）作为提示，但在真实场景中复杂混合退化难以获取这些先验信息，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 设计空间-光谱退化度量来连续量化多维退化作为退化提示；引入空间-光谱自适应模块动态调制特征提取；将SSAM作为专家集成到混合专家架构中，使用退化提示作为门控路由器。

Result: 在自然和遥感高光谱数据集上的大量实验表明，DAMP达到最先进性能，并展现出卓越的泛化能力，能适应多样、混合或未见过的退化情况。

Conclusion: DAMP框架通过退化感知度量提示，无需依赖预定义退化先验，实现了自适应、高效且鲁棒的高光谱图像恢复，为统一图像恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像语义分割面临类间相似性高、类内变异性大的挑战，现有方法难以将抽象且强判别性的语义知识有效注入像素级特征学习，导致复杂场景中边界模糊和类别混淆。

Method: 提出BiCoR-Seg框架：1) 热图驱动的双向信息协同模块(HBIS)，通过生成类别级热图建立特征图与类别嵌入之间的双向信息流；2) 分层监督策略，将每个HBIS模块生成的可解释热图直接用作低分辨率分割预测进行监督；3) 跨层类别嵌入Fisher判别损失，增强嵌入表示的判别能力。

Conclusion: BiCoR-Seg通过双向协同精炼框架有效解决了高分辨率遥感图像语义分割的挑战，在提升分割性能的同时增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability. The released code is available at https://github.com/ShiJinghao566/BiCoR-Seg.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LADLE-MM是一个在有限标注数据和训练资源下工作的多模态虚假信息检测器，通过模型集成初始化，使用BLIP提取的多模态嵌入作为固定参考空间，参数比SOTA模型少60.3%，但在DGM4和VERITE数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多媒体内容生成和操纵工具的普及，现实主义的合成篡改数字媒体已成为广泛威胁，常涉及多模态同时操纵。这些技术被越来越多地用于扭曲重要事件叙述和在社交媒体上传播虚假信息。现有的多模态虚假信息检测方法通常依赖计算密集型架构或需要大量标注数据。

Method: 提出LADLE-MM：基于有限标注的学习集成多模态虚假信息检测器。模型包含两个单模态分支和一个多模态分支，多模态分支使用BLIP提取的多模态嵌入作为固定参考空间来增强图像和文本表示。采用模型集成初始化，在有限标注设置和受限训练资源下工作。

Result: 在DGM4基准测试中，尽管可训练参数比先前SOTA模型少60.3%，但在二元和多标签分类任务上均取得竞争性性能，在没有基础标注的情况下优于现有方法。在VERITE数据集上，LADLE-MM超越了使用更复杂大型视觉语言模型架构的当前SOTA方法，展示了在开放集设置中的有效泛化能力和对单模态偏差的强大鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LADLE-MM证明了在有限标注数据和训练资源下，通过模型集成初始化和使用BLIP多模态嵌入作为固定参考空间，可以构建高效的多模态虚假信息检测器，在减少参数的同时保持甚至超越更复杂模型的性能，具有良好的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

TL;DR: 提出D³ETOR框架，通过两阶段方法解决弱监督伪装目标检测问题：第一阶段使用辩论增强的伪标签生成，第二阶段通过频率感知渐进去偏网络缓解标注偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督伪装目标检测方法性能远落后于全监督方法，主要因为：1) 通用分割模型生成的伪标签不可靠，缺乏任务特定语义理解；2) 忽略涂鸦标注的固有偏差，阻碍模型捕捉全局结构。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段使用自适应熵驱动点采样和多智能体辩论机制增强SAM的伪装目标检测能力；第二阶段设计FADeNet，渐进融合多级频率感知特征，动态重加权监督强度以缓解标注偏差。

Result: D³ETOR显著缩小了弱监督与全监督伪装目标检测之间的性能差距，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过联合利用伪标签和涂鸦语义的监督信号，提出的两阶段框架有效解决了弱监督伪装目标检测中的关键挑战，实现了性能的显著提升。

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个结合Dirichlet后验采样和Dempster-Shafer理论的框架，用于量化医学影像中SHAP解释的不确定性，并在三个不同医学影像数据集上评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像中广泛应用，但复杂模型（如ResNets、Vision Transformers）的解释性差。SHAP作为主流解释方法，在存在认知和随机不确定性时解释不稳定不可靠，需要量化这种不确定性。

Method: 使用Dirichlet后验采样和Dempster-Shafer理论，通过信念图、似然图和融合图方法，结合统计定量分析来量化SHAP解释的不确定性。

Result: 在三个具有不同类别分布、图像质量和模态类型的医学影像数据集（病理学、眼科学、放射学）上评估了该框架，这些数据集引入了显著的认知不确定性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效量化医学影像应用中SHAP解释的不确定性，为解决深度学习模型解释的可靠性问题提供了方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散变换器的视频虚拟试衣方法存在三个主要问题：1) 难以捕捉细粒度服装动态；2) 无法保持视频帧间背景完整性；3) 由于在DiT中引入额外交互模块导致计算成本高。此外，现有公开数据集规模和质量有限，限制了模型泛化能力和有效训练。

Conclusion: KeyTailor通过关键帧驱动的细节注入策略，有效解决了视频虚拟试衣中的服装动态捕捉和背景一致性问题，同时配合高质量数据集ViT-HD，显著提升了合成视频的真实性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

TL;DR: CRAFT是一个无需训练、模型无关的框架，通过结构化推理和多轮验证来提升文本到图像生成的质量，特别适合轻量级生成器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时优化方法依赖隐式、整体的批评或无约束的提示重写，导致行为难以解释、控制和可靠停止。而大语言模型已从基于验证、针对性修正和提前停止的结构化思维中受益。

Method: CRAFT将提示分解为依赖结构化的视觉问题，使用视觉语言模型验证生成图像，通过LLM代理仅在约束失败时应用针对性提示编辑，迭代执行直到所有约束满足后停止。

Conclusion: 显式结构化、约束驱动的推理时推理是提升多模态生成模型可靠性的关键要素，使较小或更便宜的模型能够接近更昂贵系统的质量。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.

Conclusion: SmartSplat通过创新的采样策略和尺度自适应方法，成功解决了超高分辨率图像压缩中压缩比与重建质量的平衡问题，为高效压缩提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lif314/SmartSplat.

TL;DR: DETACH：一种用于外中心视频与环境传感器对齐的分解时空框架，通过显式分解和两阶段对齐解决现有全局对齐方法的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于可穿戴传感器的自我中心视频对齐存在用户不适、隐私问题和可扩展性限制。外中心视频与环境传感器提供了一种非侵入式替代方案，但现有全局对齐方法无法捕捉局部细节，且过度依赖模态不变的时间模式，导致动作误对齐

Method: 提出DETACH框架：1）显式时空分解以保留局部细节；2）通过在线聚类发现传感器-空间特征提供语义基础；3）两阶段对齐：先通过互监督建立空间对应，再通过空间-时间加权对比损失进行时间对齐，自适应处理不同难度的负样本

Result: 在Opportunity++和HWU-USP数据集的下游任务实验中，相比适应性的自我中心-可穿戴基线方法有显著提升

Conclusion: DETACH框架有效解决了外中心视频与环境传感器对齐中的局部细节捕捉和时空模式误对齐问题，为非侵入式、可扩展的人类动作识别提供了可行方案

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

Method: 提出Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT)多智能体推理框架，在推理过程中通过最终的异常聚焦分类层引入归纳犯罪偏差

Result: 在低分辨率视频中异常检测F1分数提升11.8个百分点，在高分辨率视频中异常分类提升3.78个百分点

Conclusion: CoAT框架通过引入异常偏差有效解决了大型视觉语言模型在视频监控中的偏见问题，显著提升了异常检测和分类性能

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

Abstract: Skin cancer can be identified by dermoscopic examination and ocular inspection, but early detection significantly increases survival chances. Artificial intelligence (AI), using annotated skin images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), improves diagnostic accuracy. This paper presents an early skin cancer classification method using a soft voting ensemble of CNNs. In this investigation, three benchmark datasets, namely HAM10000, ISIC 2016, and ISIC 2019, were used. The process involved rebalancing, image augmentation, and filtering techniques, followed by a hybrid dual encoder for segmentation via transfer learning. Accurate segmentation focused classification models on clinically significant features, reducing background artifacts and improving accuracy. Classification was performed through an ensemble of MobileNetV2, VGG19, and InceptionV3, balancing accuracy and speed for real-world deployment. The method achieved lesion recognition accuracies of 96.32\%, 90.86\%, and 93.92\% for the three datasets. The system performance was evaluated using established skin lesion detection metrics, yielding impressive results.

Motivation: 在制造系统中，图像异常检测是核心技术，但传统方法在处理纹理缺陷图像时存在误识别、鲁棒性低、过度依赖大规模结构化数据集等问题。

Method: 提出纹理基集成平滑分解方法，包含两个主要过程：1) 学习纹理基函数以提取准周期纹理模式；2) 利用纹理基作为先验知识进行异常检测，防止纹理误识别并高精度捕获潜在异常。

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的运动理解方法大多忽略了关节驱动力等物理线索，而这些在生物力学中是基础性的。本文旨在探索物理推断的力信息是否以及何时能够增强运动理解。

Method: 将物理推断的力信息整合到现有的运动理解流程中，系统评估其在三个主要任务上的影响：步态识别、动作识别和细粒度视频描述。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，融入力信息都带来了性能提升：CASIA-B步态识别Rank-1准确率从89.52%提升到90.39%；Gait3D从46.0%提升到47.3%；Penn Action动作识别提升2.00%，其中高用力类别如拳击/拍打提升6.96%；视频描述的ROUGE-L分数从0.310提升到0.339。

Conclusion: 物理推断的力信息能够显著补充视觉和运动学特征，特别是在动态、遮挡或外观变化的条件下，证明了力线索对运动理解的重要价值。

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地雷仍然是持续的人道主义威胁，全球有1.1亿枚活跃地雷分布在60个国家，每年造成2.6万人伤亡。研究旨在利用地雷与周围土壤的热对比来增强特征提取，提高无人机系统对地表地雷的检测能力。

Method: 使用自适应RGB和长波红外融合技术，采用YOLO架构（v8、v10、v11）在114张测试图像上进行评估，生成35,640个模型条件评估。同时比较了RF-DETR、Faster R-CNN、RetinaNet等不同架构的性能。

Result: YOLOv11达到最佳性能（86.8% mAP），10-30%热融合在5-10米高度为最优检测参数。YOLOv11训练速度比RF-DETR快17.7倍（41分钟 vs 12小时）。多时相训练数据集优于季节特定方法1.8-9.6%。反坦克地雷检测准确率61.9%，反人员地雷仅19.2%。

Conclusion: 自适应RGB-LWIR融合能有效增强地表地雷检测，YOLOv11在准确性和效率间提供了最佳平衡。多时相训练能提高模型鲁棒性，但反人员地雷检测仍具挑战性。未来研究应量化不同埋藏深度和土壤类型下的热对比效应。

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

Abstract: This manuscript explores multimodal alignment, translation, fusion, and transference to enhance machine understanding of complex inputs. We organize the work into five chapters, each addressing unique challenges in multimodal machine learning.
  Chapter 3 introduces Spatial-Reasoning Bert for translating text-based spatial relations into 2D arrangements between clip-arts. This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding.
  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.
  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights.
  Chapter 6 explores multimodal fusion methods for compositional action recognition. We propose a method fusing video frames and object detection representations, improving recognition robustness and accuracy.
  Chapter 7 investigates multimodal knowledge transference for egocentric action recognition. We demonstrate how multimodal knowledge distillation enables RGB-only models to mimic multimodal fusion-based capabilities, reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.
  These contributions advance methodologies for spatial language understanding, medical text interpretation, knowledge graph enrichment, and action recognition, enhancing computational systems' ability to process complex, multimodal inputs across diverse applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在快速运动、多物体交互、遮挡和快速场景变化等挑战性场景中，往往难以保持运动保真度和时空一致性。需要一种能够处理复杂动态并保持物理合理重建的方法。

Method: 1. 结合正弦表示网络的周期性激活特性与基于关键点的几何监督；2. 引入物理启发的约束来增强空间和时间维度上的关键点预测一致性；3. 利用高频信号建模捕捉细粒度几何细节；4. 扩展UniKPT数据集至60万标注实例；5. 集成图神经网络建模关键点关系和结构相关性。

Result: 在Sintel、Bonn和DAVIS基准测试中一致优于最先进方法。在DAVIS上：FVD降低17.8%，FID降低28.7%，LPIPS提升6.0%。同时改善了时间一致性、几何精度、用户评分和运动平滑度。在姿态估计中优于Monst3R，具有更低的绝对轨迹误差以及平移和旋转相对姿态误差。

Conclusion: SirenPose通过几何感知的损失公式，有效处理快速运动、复杂动态，并实现物理合理的3D场景重建，在多个指标上显著优于现有方法，展示了其在动态场景重建和姿态估计任务中的优越性。

Abstract: We introduce SirenPose, a geometry-aware loss formulation that integrates the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with keypoint-based geometric supervision, enabling accurate and temporally consistent reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos. Existing approaches often struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes. SirenPose incorporates physics inspired constraints to enforce coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, while leveraging high frequency signal modeling to capture fine grained geometric details. We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On DAVIS, SirenPose achieves a 17.8 percent reduction in FVD, a 28.7 percent reduction in FID, and a 6.0 percent improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also improves temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness. In pose estimation, SirenPose outperforms Monst3R with lower absolute trajectory error as well as reduced translational and rotational relative pose error, highlighting its effectiveness in handling rapid motion, complex dynamics, and physically plausible reconstruction.

TL;DR: AlignPose：一种无需物体特定训练的多视角6D物体姿态估计方法，通过特征度量优化在多个RGB视图中聚合信息，在工业数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单视角RGB方法存在深度模糊、遮挡和杂乱问题，而现有多视角方法要么依赖精确的单视角估计，要么缺乏对未见物体的泛化能力。需要一种能聚合多视角信息且无需物体特定训练的方法。

Method: 提出AlignPose方法：1）使用外参标定的多视角RGB图像；2）核心是多视角特征度量细化，通过优化单一一致的世界坐标系物体姿态，最小化所有视角中渲染物体特征与观测图像特征之间的差异；3）无需物体特定训练或对称性标注。

Result: 在四个数据集（YCB-V、T-LESS、ITODD-MV、HouseCat6D）上使用BOP基准评估，AlignPose优于其他已发表方法，特别是在多视角可用的工业数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: AlignPose通过多视角特征聚合有效解决了单视角方法的局限性，在无需物体特定训练的情况下实现了优异的6D姿态估计性能，特别适用于多视角可用的工业场景。

Abstract: Single-view RGB model-based object pose estimation methods achieve strong generalization but are fundamentally limited by depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice.

Motivation: 现有文本引导图像融合方法仅使用粗粒度文本描述，难以捕捉细粒度细节，且跨模态对齐不够精确，限制了融合质量提升

Method: 提出多粒度文本描述（细细节、结构线索、语义内容），设计分层跨模态调制模块，引入粒度级监督信号，采用显著性驱动数据增强模块

Result: 在多曝光和多焦点图像融合任务上，MTIF持续超越先前方法，实验验证了其有效性

Conclusion: 多粒度文本引导和分层跨模态调制能有效提升图像融合质量，为文本引导图像处理提供了新思路

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

Motivation: 仿真器能生成无限驾驶数据，但模仿学习策略在仿真中仍难以实现鲁棒的闭环性能。研究发现专家演示与学生观察之间存在严重不对齐：专家具有更高可见性（忽略遮挡）和更低不确定性（知道其他车辆动作），且导航意图在测试时仅通过单个目标点指定，这些不对称性限制了驾驶性能。

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

TL;DR: DSR Suite：针对动态空间推理的数据集、基准和模型解决方案，通过自动生成几何增强的问答对和轻量级几何选择模块提升VLM的4D推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在动态空间推理（DSR）方面表现较弱，主要原因是缺乏可扩展的4D感知训练资源。DSR涉及理解3D空间中物体几何和关系随时间的变化，这对许多实际应用至关重要。

Method: 1. 提出自动化流水线从野外视频生成DSR的多选题问答对，利用现代视觉基础模型提取几何和运动信息；2. 构建DSR-Train训练集和人工精炼的DSR-Bench评估集；3. 设计轻量级几何选择模块（GSM），将几何先验知识压缩为几何标记集成到VLM中

Result: 将DSR-Train和GSM集成到Qwen2.5-VL-7B后，显著提升了模型的动态空间推理能力，同时在通用视频理解基准上保持了准确率

Conclusion: DSR Suite通过数据集、基准和模型三个方面的创新，有效解决了VLM在动态空间推理方面的瓶颈，为4D感知推理提供了完整的解决方案

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) excel at general understanding yet remain weak at dynamic spatial reasoning (DSR), i.e., reasoning about the evolvement of object geometry and relationship in 3D space over time, largely due to the scarcity of scalable 4D-aware training resources. To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.

TL;DR: FlashVLM：基于文本引导的视觉token选择框架，通过跨模态相似性计算和多样性保留机制，在显著减少视觉token的同时保持甚至超越未剪枝模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模视觉语言模型处理大量视觉token时存在二次注意力成本和冗余问题。现有的token减少方法要么忽略文本查询，要么依赖不稳定的深度注意力图，在激进剪枝时会导致语义对齐退化。

Method: 提出文本引导的视觉token选择框架：1）计算投影图像token与归一化文本嵌入在语言模型空间中的显式跨模态相似性；2）使用对数域加权和温度控制锐化将外在相关性与内在视觉显著性融合；3）通过多样性保留分区保留最小但具有代表性的背景token以维持全局上下文。

Result: 在相同token预算和评估协议下，FlashVLM实现了超越无损压缩的效果：在LLaVA 1.5上剪枝高达77.8%的视觉token，在94.4%压缩率下仍保持92.8%准确率，在14个图像和视频基准测试中达到最先进的效率-性能权衡。

Conclusion: FlashVLM通过文本引导的视觉token选择，在显著减少计算成本的同时保持甚至提升模型性能，为视觉语言模型的高效部署提供了有效的解决方案，具有强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

TL;DR: DiTracker：利用预训练的视频扩散变换器（DiTs）进行点跟踪的新方法，通过注意力匹配和轻量级调优，在挑战性基准测试中达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于浅层卷积网络（如ResNet）的点跟踪方法处理帧时缺乏时间一致性，在挑战性条件下产生不可靠的匹配成本。研究发现预训练的视频DiTs具有内在的点跟踪能力，能鲁棒处理动态运动和频繁遮挡

Method: 提出DiTracker方法：1）查询-键注意力匹配；2）轻量级LoRA调优；3）与ResNet主干网络的成本融合。通过适应视频DiTs的时空注意力特性来提升点跟踪性能

Result: 在训练批次大小小8倍的情况下，DiTracker在挑战性ITTO基准测试中达到SOTA性能，在TAP-Vid基准测试中匹配或超越SOTA模型

Conclusion: 验证了视频DiT特征作为点跟踪任务的有效且高效基础，展示了预训练视频扩散变换器在点跟踪任务中的强大潜力

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedPOD是一种用于联邦学习的新型优化方法，通过比例编排导数提高学习效率和通信效率，解决了FedPIDAvg的局限性，并在医学图像分割任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FedPIDAvg方法虽然通过PID控制器和泊松分布建模提高了性能并降低了通信成本，但存在两个主要问题：1) 基于泊松分布排除异常值参与者限制了数据利用；2) PID控制器需要在整个联邦学习过程中保持相同的参与者，因为使用了历史轮次的学习信息。FedPOD旨在解决这些限制。

Method: FedPOD采用比例编排导数方法，主要创新包括：1) 包含被排除的异常值参与者；2) 消除对历史轮次学习信息的依赖；3) 应用每轮验证损失计算方法。此外，从Kubernetes的最小计算单元POD获得灵感，设计为与Kubernetes自动扩缩容兼容，将轮次任务扩展到POD单元，实现类似Kubernetes的灵活扩展设计。

Result: 在医学图像分割任务中，FedPOD在Dice分数指标上与FedPIDAvg表现相当：WT为0.78，ET为0.71，TC为0.72（平均值）。收敛分数平均为0.74。FedPOD展示了在提高效率、灵活性和性能指标方面的潜力。

Conclusion: FedPOD通过解决FedPIDAvg的局限性，在保持性能的同时提高了联邦学习的效率和灵活性。其与Kubernetes架构的兼容性为联邦学习系统的可扩展设计提供了新思路，展示了在医疗图像分析等领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

TL;DR: 提出L-IVA基准和ORCA框架，首次实现视频虚拟形象具备主动智能和长期目标规划能力，通过内部世界模型和OTAR循环解决生成环境中的不确定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频虚拟形象生成方法虽然能保持身份一致性和动作对齐，但缺乏真正的自主性，无法通过自适应环境交互来追求长期目标

Method: 提出ORCA框架，包含两个关键创新：1）闭环OTAR循环（观察-思考-行动-反思），在生成不确定性下保持鲁棒状态跟踪；2）分层双系统架构，System 2进行战略推理，System 1将抽象计划转化为具体动作描述

Result: ORCA在任务成功率和行为一致性方面显著优于开环和非反思基线，验证了内部世界模型设计能将视频虚拟形象从被动动画提升到主动、目标导向的行为

Conclusion: 通过将虚拟形象控制建模为POMDP并实施连续信念更新与结果验证，ORCA能够在开放域场景中实现自主多步任务完成，推动了视频虚拟形象智能从被动动画向主动目标导向行为的演进

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SpatialTree——一个基于认知科学的空间能力四层次框架（感知、心理映射、模拟、智能体能力），并构建了首个能力中心的分层基准，揭示了MLLMs空间能力的结构特性和迁移规律，提出了改进策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的空间能力研究缺乏系统性框架，大多聚焦于狭窄的任务集，未能理解空间能力从感知到推理和交互的渐进发展层次。

Method: 1. 提出SpatialTree四层次框架：L1低层感知、L2心理映射、L3模拟、L4智能体能力；2. 构建首个能力中心的分层基准，评估27种子能力；3. 通过有监督微调探索迁移动态；4. 提出自动思考策略改进强化学习。

Result: 1. 揭示了清晰的结构模式：L1技能基本正交，高层技能强相关；2. 发现迁移动态：L1内负迁移，但低层到高层有强跨层迁移和协同效应；3. 传统强化学习不可靠，自动思考策略能一致提升所有层次性能。

Conclusion: SpatialTree为理解和系统扩展MLLMs的空间能力提供了概念验证框架，揭示了空间能力的层次结构和迁移规律，并提出了有效的改进策略。

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

TL;DR: SemanticGen提出了一种在语义空间而非VAE潜在空间生成视频的新方法，通过两阶段扩散模型实现更高效的视频生成，特别适用于长视频场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于VAE潜在空间的视频生成方法存在收敛慢、计算成本高的问题，尤其是在生成长视频时。视频固有的冗余性使得直接在低层次VAE token上进行双向注意力建模效率低下。

Method: 采用两阶段生成过程：第一阶段使用扩散模型在紧凑的语义空间生成视频特征，定义视频的全局布局；第二阶段使用另一个扩散模型在VAE潜在空间生成最终输出，但以第一阶段的语义特征为条件。

Result: 实验表明，在语义空间生成比在VAE潜在空间生成收敛更快，计算效率更高，特别是在长视频生成方面表现优异。SemanticGen能够生成高质量视频，性能优于现有最先进方法和强基线。

Conclusion: 在语义空间进行视频生成是一种有效的策略，通过先进行全局规划再添加高频细节的方式，解决了传统VAE潜在空间方法的收敛慢和计算成本高的问题，特别适用于长视频生成场景。

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

Conclusion: 不同学习范式具有互补优势，可根据标注数据可用性定制HAR解决方案。提出的弱自监督学习框架为标注数据有限的实用HAR应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors has advanced through various machine learning paradigms, each with inherent trade-offs between performance and labeling requirements. While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited.

Method: 使用MIMIC-III、MIMIC-IV、eICU和HiRID数据集，开发了一个多模态深度学习模型。输入包括时间不变变量、时间变量、临床笔记和胸部X光图像，预测ICU入院24小时后的死亡风险。

Result: 模型在结构化数据上的AUROC为0.92，AUPRC为0.53，Brier分数为0.19。在eICU的8个不同机构外部验证中，AUROC范围为0.84-0.92。加入临床笔记和影像数据后，性能进一步提升（AUROC从0.87提升到0.89）。

Abstract: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients can aid clinicians in optimizing treatment. The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating multiple sources of patient information for mortality prediction and the importance of external validation.

Abstract: Finding rare but useful solutions in very large candidate spaces is a recurring practical challenge across language generation, planning, and reinforcement learning. We present a practical framework, \emph{Inverted Causality Focusing Algorithm} (ICFA), that treats search as a target-conditioned reweighting process. ICFA reuses an available proposal sampler and a task-specific similarity function to form a focused sampling distribution, while adaptively controlling focusing strength to avoid degeneracy. We provide a clear recipe, a stability diagnostic based on effective sample size, a compact theoretical sketch explaining when ICFA can reduce sample needs, and two reproducible experiments: constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation. We further show how structured prompts instantiate an approximate, language-level form of ICFA and describe a hybrid architecture combining prompted inference with algorithmic reweighting.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), synthetic data are widely used to accelerate innovation while preserving privacy and enabling broader data accessibility. However, the evaluation of synthetic data remains fragmented across heterogeneous metrics, ad-hoc scripts, and incomplete reporting practices. To address this gap, we introduce Synthetic Data Blueprint (SDB), a modular Pythonic based library to quantitatively and visually assess the fidelity of synthetic tabular data. SDB supports: (i) automated feature-type detection, (ii) distributional and dependency-level fidelity metrics, (iii) graph- and embedding-based structure preservation scores, and (iv) a rich suite of data visualization schemas. To demonstrate the breadth, robustness, and domain-agnostic applicability of the SDB, we evaluated the framework across three real-world use cases that differ substantially in scale, feature composition, statistical complexity, and downstream analytical requirements. These include: (i) healthcare diagnostics, (ii) socioeconomic and financial modelling, and (iii) cybersecurity and network traffic analysis. These use cases reveal how SDB can address diverse data fidelity assessment challenges, varying from mixed-type clinical variables to high-cardinality categorical attributes and high-dimensional telemetry signals, while at the same time offering a consistent, transparent, and reproducible benchmarking across heterogeneous domains.

Abstract: Targeted maintenance strategies, ensuring the dependability and safety of industrial machinery. However, current modeling techniques for assessing both local and global correlation of battery degradation sequences are inefficient and difficult to meet the needs in real-life applications. For this reason, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, multiscale dual-path feature aggregation network (MDFA-Net), for RUL prediction. MDFA-Net consists of dual-path networks, the first path network, multiscale feature network (MF-Net) that maintains the shallow information and avoids missing information, and the second path network is an encoder network (EC-Net) that captures the continuous trend of the sequences and retains deep details. Integrating both deep and shallow attributes effectively grasps both local and global patterns. Testing conducted with two publicly available Lithium-ion battery datasets reveals our approach surpasses existing top-tier methods in RUL forecasting, accurately mapping the capacity degradation trajectory.

Motivation: 服务多个任务专用LLM变体时，微调检查点的大尺寸导致存储开销大和冷启动延迟高，而微调权重与基础模型的差异相对较小且具有结构化特征

Method: 提出1-bit delta方案：仅存储权重差异的符号，配合轻量级每轴（行/列）FP16缩放因子，通过小规模校准集学习缩放参数，使用流式加载器在单个操作中传输打包的delta

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的drop-in解决方案，通过压缩权重差异实现高效模型更新和部署，在保持推理效率的同时大幅减少存储和延迟开销

Abstract: Serving many task-specialized LLM variants is often limited by the large size of fine-tuned checkpoints and the resulting cold-start latency. Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint. The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, and maintains inference efficiency by avoiding dense reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出一个符号感知的多状态Jaccard/Tanimoto框架，将基于重叠的距离从非负向量扩展到任意实值和复值信号，同时保持有界度量结构和正半定核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Jaccard/Tanimoto相似度仅适用于非负向量，无法处理包含正负符号的实值信号和复值信号。需要一种统一的框架来处理任意实值和复值信号，同时保持有界度量、正半定核等良好数学性质。

Conclusion: 提出的符号感知多状态框架成功扩展了Jaccard/Tanimoto相似度到任意实值和复值信号，提供了一个统一的、数学性质良好的距离度量，具有机制可解释性和广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce a sign-aware, multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework that extends overlap-based distances from nonnegative vectors and measures to arbitrary real- and complex-valued signals while retaining bounded metric and positive-semidefinite kernel structure. Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.

Abstract: This work introduces a methodology to adjust forecasts based on node-specific cost function asymmetry. The proposed model generates savings by dynamically incorporating the cost asymmetry into the forecasting error probability distribution to favor the least expensive scenario. Savings are calculated and a self-regulation mechanism modulates the adjustments magnitude based on the observed savings, enabling the model to adapt to station-specific conditions and unmodeled factors such as calibration errors or shifting macroeconomic dynamics. Finally, empirical results demonstrate the model's ability to achieve \$5.1M annual savings.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework that efficiently integrates data quality assessment with machine learning (ML) model operations in real-time production environments. While existing approaches treat data quality assessment and ML systems as isolated processes, our framework addresses the critical gap between theoretical methods and practical implementation by combining dynamic drift detection, adaptive data quality metrics, and MLOps into a cohesive, lightweight system. The key innovation lies in its operational efficiency, enabling real-time, quality-driven ML decision-making with minimal computational overhead. We validate the framework in a steel manufacturing company's Electroslag Remelting (ESR) vacuum pumping process, demonstrating a 12% improvement in model performance (R2 = 94%) and a fourfold reduction in prediction latency. By exploring the impact of data quality acceptability thresholds, we provide actionable insights into balancing data quality standards and predictive performance in industrial applications.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of machine learning models across a wide range of fields, fueled by increased computational resources, large-scale datasets, and the rise of deep learning architectures. From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.

Motivation: 强化学习在视觉任务上表现优异，但在资源受限的边缘设备上部署面临计算成本和通信延迟的挑战。现有方案通常将策略推理卸载到远程服务器，但需要传输高维观测数据并产生网络往返延迟。

Method: 采用分割策略架构：设备端小型编码器（实现为OpenGL片段着色器）将观测转换为紧凑特征张量，传输到远程策略头。这种方法减少传输数据量，降低带宽受限环境下的决策延迟，同时减少服务器端计算需求。

Result: 在NVIDIA Jetson Nano、Raspberry Pi 4B和Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W上评估，学习性能（最终100回合平均回报）基本可比，平均回报有适度权衡。减少了传输数据，降低了带宽受限环境下的决策延迟，减少了服务器端计算需求。

Conclusion: 分割策略架构有效解决了边缘设备部署视觉强化学习策略的挑战，在保持学习性能的同时显著减少了通信开销和延迟，为资源受限环境提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved strong results, but deploying visual policies on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to computational cost and communication latency. Many deployments therefore offload policy inference to a remote server, incurring network round trips and requiring transmission of high-dimensional observations. We introduce a split-policy architecture in which a small on-device encoder, implemented as OpenGL fragment-shader passes for broad embedded GPU support, transforms each observation into a compact feature tensor that is transmitted to a remote policy head. In RL, this communication overhead manifests as closed-loop decision latency rather than only per-request inference latency. The proposed approach reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency in bandwidth-limited settings, and reduces server-side compute per request, whilst achieving broadly comparable learning performance by final return (mean over the final 100 episodes) in single-run benchmarks, with modest trade-offs in mean return. We evaluate across an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a Raspberry Pi 4B, and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, reporting learning results, on-device execution behaviour under sustained load, and end-to-end decision latency and scalability measurements under bandwidth shaping. Code for training, deployment, and measurement is released as open source.

Abstract: Forecasting technological advancement in complex domains such as space exploration presents significant challenges due to the intricate interaction of technical, economic, and policy-related factors. The field of technology forecasting has long relied on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques, such as growth curves (e.g., Moore's law) and time series models, to project technological progress. To assess the current state of these methods, we conducted an updated systematic literature review (SLR) that incorporates recent advances. This review highlights a growing trend toward machine learning-based hybrid models.
  Motivated by this review, we developed a forecasting model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes. Operational lifetime is an important engineering characteristic of spacecraft and a potential proxy for technological progress in space exploration. Lifetimes were modeled as depending on launch date and additional predictors.
  Our modeling analysis introduces a novel advance in the recently introduced Start Time End Time Integration (STETI) approach. STETI addresses a critical right censoring problem known to bias lifetime analyses: the more recent the launch dates, the shorter the lifetimes of the spacecraft that have failed and can thus contribute lifetime data. Longer-lived spacecraft are still operating and therefore do not contribute data. This systematically distorts putative lifetime versus launch date curves by biasing lifetime estimates for recent launch dates downward. STETI mitigates this distortion by interconverting between expressing lifetimes as functions of launch time and modeling them as functions of failure time. The results provide insights relevant to space mission planning and policy decision-making.

Motivation: 当前LLM在数学推理上仍有困难，传统方法将解决方案简化为二元正确/错误过于局限，而RLHF方法成本高、难以扩展且不稳定。需要一种轻量级方法针对结构化错误进行改进。

Result: 在1.5B参数的Qwen2.5模型上，验证器引导的加权DPO比普通SFT和未加权DPO产生更有针对性的改进，特别是在解决方案数值接近正确但逻辑不一致的问题上，同时避免了训练大型奖励模型或依赖外部评判的开销。

Conclusion: 提出了一种轻量级、实用的后训练流程，通过小型验证器识别结构化错误并指导DPO训练，在有限计算预算下有效提升LLM的数学推理能力，避免了传统RLHF方法的复杂性和成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with mathematical reasoning, and common post-training pipelines often reduce each generated solution to a binary outcome: correct or incorrect. This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges.

Abstract: Diffusion models can learn rich representations during data generation, showing potential for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), but they face a trade-off between generative quality and discriminative performance. Their iterative sampling also incurs substantial computational and energy costs, hindering industrial and edge AI applications. To address these issues, we propose the Flow Matching-based Foundation Model (FlowFM), which jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator. This decoupled design achieves both high-fidelity generation and effective recognition. By using flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field, FlowFM accelerates and stabilizes training, improving its efficiency for representation learning. Experiments on wearable sensor data show FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4\% compared to a diffusion-based approach. On downstream tasks, FlowFM surpassed the state-of-the-art SSL method (SSL-Wearables) on all five datasets while achieving up to a 51.0x inference speedup and maintaining high generative quality.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/SeRAlab/ArcGen.

Conclusion: Double-Win NAS通过深度到浅层的可转换设计，同时实现了高精度和高硬件效率，为资源受限的嵌入式智能系统提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Thanks to the evolving network depth, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success across various embedded scenarios, paving the way for ubiquitous embedded intelligence. Despite its promise, the evolving network depth comes at the cost of degraded hardware efficiency. In contrast to deep networks, shallow networks can deliver superior hardware efficiency but often suffer from inferior accuracy. To address this dilemma, we propose Double-Win NAS, a novel deep-to-shallow transformable neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm tailored for resource-constrained intelligent embedded systems. Specifically, Double-Win NAS strives to automatically explore deep networks to first win strong accuracy, which are then equivalently transformed into their shallow counterparts to further win strong hardware efficiency. In addition to search, we also propose two enhanced training techniques, including hybrid transformable training towards better training accuracy and arbitrary-resolution elastic training towards enabling natural network elasticity across arbitrary input resolutions. Extensive experimental results on two popular intelligent embedded systems (i.e., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and NVIDIA Jetson Nano) and two representative large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageNet and ImageNet-100) clearly demonstrate the superiority of Double-Win NAS over previous state-of-the-art NAS approaches.

Abstract: In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset and identify and remove descriptors that may inadvertently encode band-structure information, such as effective masses. This process yields a curated, leakage-controlled subset of 2280 materials. Using this dataset, a three-phase modeling framework is implemented that incrementally incorporates basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes. The results show that tree-based models achieve R2 values of approximately 0.88 to 0.90 across all phases, indicating that expanding the descriptor space does not substantially improve predictive accuracy when leakage is controlled. SHAP analysis consistently identifies the dielectric tensor components as the dominant contributors.

TL;DR: 提出一种替代稀疏自编码器的方法，通过聚类激活差异来提取可解释概念，在质量上超越无监督SAE变体并接近有监督基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种比稀疏自编码器更简单有效的无监督方法，从神经网络中提取可解释的概念，以理解模型内部表示

Method: 基于判别分析框架，聚类激活差异，并通过激活偏度加权来增强概念多样性，与德勒兹的差异概念观一致

Result: 在5个模型和3种模态（视觉、语言、音频）上评估，概念质量超越先前无监督SAE变体，接近有监督基线，提取的概念能够引导模型内部表示

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的无监督概念提取方法，提取的概念具有因果影响力，可用于模型解释和操控

Abstract: We propose an alternative to sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as a simple and effective unsupervised method for extracting interpretable concepts from neural networks. The core idea is to cluster differences in activations, which we formally justify within a discriminant analysis framework. To enhance the diversity of extracted concepts, we refine the approach by weighting the clustering using the skewness of activations. The method aligns with Deleuze's modern view of concepts as differences. We evaluate the approach across five models and three modalities (vision, language, and audio), measuring concept quality, diversity, and consistency. Our results show that the proposed method achieves concept quality surpassing prior unsupervised SAE variants while approaching supervised baselines, and that the extracted concepts enable steering of a model's inner representations, demonstrating their causal influence on downstream behavior.

### [90] [Case Prompting to Mitigate Large Language Model Bias for ICU Mortality Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19735)
*Gangxiong Zhang,Yongchao Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CAP框架，通过临床自适应提示在ICU死亡率预测中同时提升公平性和准确性，无需重新训练模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在ICU死亡率预测中存在人口统计学偏见（性别、年龄、种族），现有去偏方法通常会降低预测性能，难以同时优化公平性和准确性

Method: 开发多维偏见评估方案，提出CAP（CAse Prompting）框架，结合传统去偏提示和基于案例的推理，让模型从历史误判案例中学习纠正偏见推理模式

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上，CAP将AUROC从0.806提升到0.873，AUPRC从0.497提升到0.694，同时将性别和种族相关差异减少90%以上，特征依赖分析显示跨人口群体注意力模式高度一致

Conclusion: LLM在ICU死亡率预测中存在可测量的偏见，精心设计的提示框架可以在不重新训练的情况下有效共同优化公平性和性能，为公平临床决策支持提供可转移的范式

Abstract: Accurate mortality risk prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is essential for clinical decision-making. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CoPHo方法，通过预训练分类器的梯度指导拓扑生成，结合持续同调技术，在保持拓扑结构的同时匹配目标属性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拓扑数据稀缺，需要生成具有特定属性的合成图。传统扩散方法要么需要为每个属性重新训练模型，要么使用分类器指导但不考虑拓扑尺度和实际约束

Method: 从离散视角出发，将预训练图级分类器的梯度融入离散反向扩散后验分布中。提出CoPHo方法，在中间图上构建持续同调过滤，将特征解释为指导信号，在每一步去噪过程中引导生成朝向期望属性

Result: 在四个通用/网络数据集上的实验表明，CoPHo在匹配目标指标方面优于现有方法，并在QM9分子数据集上验证了其可迁移性

Conclusion: CoPHo方法能够有效地生成具有指定结构属性的拓扑图，解决了传统方法需要重新训练和不考虑拓扑尺度的问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: The structure of topology underpins much of the research on performance and robustness, yet available topology data are typically scarce, necessitating the generation of synthetic graphs with desired properties for testing or release. Prior diffusion-based approaches either embed conditions into the diffusion model, requiring retraining for each attribute and hindering real-time applicability, or use classifier-based guidance post-training, which does not account for topology scale and practical constraints. In this paper, we show from a discrete perspective that gradients from a pre-trained graph-level classifier can be incorporated into the discrete reverse diffusion posterior to steer generation toward specified structural properties. Based on this insight, we propose Classifier-guided Conditional Topology Generation with Persistent Homology (CoPHo), which builds a persistent homology filtration over intermediate graphs and interprets features as guidance signals that steer generation toward the desired properties at each denoising step. Experiments on four generic/network datasets demonstrate that CoPHo outperforms existing methods at matching target metrics, and we further validate its transferability on the QM9 molecular dataset.

Motivation: 可靠的列车延误预测对提升铁路运输系统的鲁棒性和效率至关重要。传统方法难以捕捉延迟传播的序列性和不确定性特征，需要结合事件驱动模型和数据驱动方法的优势

Method: 提出漂移校正模仿学习（DCIL）算法，将延迟预测重构为随机模拟任务，通过状态转移动态建模。DCIL扩展了DAgger算法，加入基于距离的漂移校正，无需外部预言机或对抗方案即可缓解协变量偏移。结合事件驱动模型的动态保真度和数据驱动方法的表示能力，通过蒙特卡洛模拟实现不确定性感知预测

Conclusion: DCIL算法成功将延迟预测重构为随机模拟任务，通过漂移校正的模仿学习方法有效解决了协变量偏移问题，在真实铁路数据上展示了优越的预测性能，为大规模铁路网络的延迟传播建模提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Reliable prediction of train delays is essential for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of railway transportation systems. In this work, we reframe delay forecasting as a stochastic simulation task, modeling state-transition dynamics through imitation learning. We introduce Drift-Corrected Imitation Learning (DCIL), a novel self-supervised algorithm that extends DAgger by incorporating distance-based drift correction, thereby mitigating covariate shift during rollouts without requiring access to an external oracle or adversarial schemes. Our approach synthesizes the dynamical fidelity of event-driven models with the representational capacity of data-driven methods, enabling uncertainty-aware forecasting via Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate DCIL using a comprehensive real-world dataset from \textsc{Infrabel}, the Belgian railway infrastructure manager, which encompasses over three million train movements. Our results, focused on predictions up to 30 minutes ahead, demonstrate superior predictive performance of DCIL over traditional regression models and behavioral cloning on deep learning architectures, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the sequential and uncertain nature of delay propagation in large-scale networks.

Motivation: 最后一公里物流中包裹量预测准确性至关重要，预测错误会导致资源分配低效、成本增加和配送延迟。现有方法需要更好的预测精度和决策支持。

Method: 1. LightGBM回归模型生成站点级需求预测；2. PPO强化学习代理基于预测选择缓冲水平；3. 奖励函数对缓冲不足惩罚更重；4. 蒙特卡洛更新机制实现持续策略适应；5. 生成式AI层基于SHAP特征归因生成执行级摘要和场景分析。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合预测建模的上下文强化学习可以解决运营预测挑战，在高风险物流环境中将统计严谨性与实际决策制定相结合。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of package volumes at delivery stations is critical for last-mile logistics, where errors lead to inefficient resource allocation, higher costs, and delivery delays. We propose OpComm, a forecasting and decision-support framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning-based buffer control and a generative AI-driven communication module. A LightGBM regression model generates station-level demand forecasts, which serve as context for a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that selects buffer levels from a discrete action set. The reward function penalizes under-buffering more heavily than over-buffering, reflecting real-world trade-offs between unmet demand risks and resource inefficiency. Station outcomes are fed back through a Monte Carlo update mechanism, enabling continual policy adaptation. To enhance interpretability, a generative AI layer produces executive-level summaries and scenario analyses grounded in SHAP-based feature attributions. Across 400+ stations, OpComm reduced Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) by 21.65% compared to manual forecasts, while lowering under-buffering incidents and improving transparency for decision-makers. This work shows how contextual reinforcement learning, coupled with predictive modeling, can address operational forecasting challenges and bridge statistical rigor with practical decision-making in high-stakes logistics environments.

*Soumen Garai,Suman Samui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出OASI初始化策略，使用多目标模拟退火生成高质量种子Pareto集，在TinyML关键词检测任务中优于传统初始化方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在超低功耗TinyML设备上实现准确的关键词检测需要平衡精度和资源约束，但现有的多目标贝叶斯优化初始化方法依赖简单的采样策略，缺乏针对Pareto前沿的优化和统计验证

Method: 提出Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI)策略，利用Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA)生成高质量、多样化的种子Pareto配置集，显式平衡精度和模型大小

Result: 在TinyML关键词检测任务中，OASI在超体积(0.0627)和代际距离(0.0)指标上优于LHS、Sobol和随机初始化，计算时间仅适度增加(1934秒 vs. ~1500秒)，统计分析确认其优越的一致性

Conclusion: OASI为多目标贝叶斯优化提供了更有效的初始化策略，在资源受限的TinyML应用中能更好地平衡精度和模型大小，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Voice assistants utilize Keyword Spotting (KWS) to enable efficient, privacy-friendly activation. However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $η^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $α=0.05$ threshold.

Conclusion: 该框架为边缘平台上的高效Transformer推理提供了实用路径，并为集成动态稀疏性和MoE架构以进一步提升性能开辟了未来方向。

Abstract: Deploying large-scale transformer models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to strict constraints on memory, compute, and latency. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.

Motivation: 现有3D点云损失函数存在权衡：Chamfer距离计算高效但允许多对一对应关系，Earth Mover距离能更好反映一对一传输但计算成本高，APML通过可微Sinkhorn迭代近似传输但密集实现内存呈二次方增长。

Method: 提出CUDA-APML稀疏GPU实现：1）阈值化可忽略分配；2）在COO格式中直接运行自适应softmax、双向对称化和Sinkhorn归一化；3）在存储的支持集上保持梯度；4）保持成对距离评估的二次方特性。

Result: 在ShapeNet和MM-Fi数据集上，CUDA-APML在较小容差范围内匹配密集APML性能，同时将峰值GPU内存减少99.9%，实现近线性内存扩展。

Conclusion: CUDA-APML通过稀疏GPU实现解决了APML内存二次方增长的问题，在保持传输近似精度的同时大幅降低内存需求，为3D点云学习提供了更实用的损失函数。

Abstract: Loss functions are fundamental to learning accurate 3D point cloud models, yet common choices trade geometric fidelity for computational cost. Chamfer Distance is efficient but permits many-to-one correspondences, while Earth Mover Distance better reflects one-to-one transport at high computational cost. APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations and an analytically derived temperature, but its dense formulation scales quadratically in memory. We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation. On ShapeNet and MM-Fi, CUDA-APML matches dense APML within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9%. Code available at: https://github.com/Multimodal-Sensing-Lab/apml

Motivation: 现有稀疏混合专家框架要么过度依赖超参数调优，要么在调整专家池大小时忽视了专家间语义角色的多样化，无法充分发挥MoE架构的潜力。

Method: 提出MASS框架，包含两个关键技术：1) 基于梯度的语义漂移检测器，当现有专家池无法捕捉数据完整语义多样性时触发定向专家扩展；2) 自适应路由策略，基于token级路由置信度动态调整专家使用。

Result: 在高度控制的合成设置中，MASS可靠地收敛到成本-性能权衡的最佳平衡点，语义专业化显著提升。在语言和视觉领域的真实数据集上，MASS持续优于多种强MoE基线，展示了领域鲁棒性和增强的专家专业化。

Conclusion: MASS通过语义感知的自适应专家扩展和动态路由，有效解决了稀疏混合专家框架中语义专业化不足的问题，在多个领域实现了优越的性能表现。

Abstract: Finding the optimal configuration of Sparse Mixture-ofExperts (SMoE) that maximizes semantic differentiation among experts is essential for exploiting the full potential of MoE architectures. However, existing SMoE frameworks either heavily rely on hyperparameter tuning or overlook the importance of diversifying semantic roles across experts when adapting the expert pool size. We propose Mixture-of-Experts for Adaptive Semantic Specialization (MASS), a semanticaware MoE framework for adaptive expert expansion and dynamic routing. MASS introduces two key advancements: (i) a gradient-based semantic drift detector that prompts targeted expert expansion when the existing expert pool lacks capacity to capture the full semantic diversity of the data, and (ii) an integration of adaptive routing strategy that dynamically adjusts expert usage based on token-level routing confidence mass. We first demonstrate that MASS reliably converges to the point of optimal balance between cost-performance trade-off with notably improved sematic specialization in a highly controlled synthetic setup. Further empirical results on real-world datasets across language and vision domains show that MASS consistently outperforms a range of strong MoE baselines, demonstrating its domain robustness and enhanced expert specialization.

Abstract: Designing efficient transit route networks is an NP-hard problem with exponentially large solution spaces that traditionally relies on manual planning processes. We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction. To address the long-horizon credit assignment challenge, we introduce a two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback with simulation-based terminal rewards. We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction. These results demonstrate that end-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: 这项工作旨在提高用户和开发者对聚类算法可重复性问题的认识，鼓励进一步调查和潜在修复，以确保科学实验的完整性和可靠性。

Abstract: Reproducibility is essential in machine learning because it ensures that a model or experiment yields the same scientific conclusion. For specific algorithms repeatability with bitwise identical results is also a key for scientific integrity because it allows debugging. We decomposed several very popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN and Ward into their fundamental steps, and we identify the conditions required to achieve repeatability at each stage. We use an implementation example with the Python library scikit-learn to examine the repeatable aspects of each method. Our results reveal inconsistent results with K-Means when the number of OpenMP threads exceeds two. This work aims to raise awareness of this issue among both users and developers, encouraging further investigation and potential fixes.

*Shane X. Coffing,John Tipton,Arvind T. Mohan,Darren Engwirda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出randPROM方法，结合神经Galerkin投影和统计层次池化，为类似问题生成统计可解释、物理合理的降阶模型，应用于海啸预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降阶模型（ROM）虽然计算效率高，但受限于特定问题的固定权重，缺乏泛化能力。需要开发能生成统计可解释、物理合理且能泛化到相似问题的ROM方法。

Method: 结合神经Galerkin投影（将PDE物理编码为初值问题，用神经网络校准权重轨迹）和统计层次池化技术（学习时间权重初值的分布），生成新的统计可解释权重，与空间特征重组形成randPROM物理代理模型。

Result: 将randPROM应用于斐济附近合成海啸和2011年日本东北海啸案例，证明能显著减少生成统计校准、物理可信的海啸波到达时间和高度预测模型所需的模拟次数。

Conclusion: randPROM方法能生成统计可解释、物理合理的降阶模型，泛化到相似问题，为海啸等非线性复杂问题提供高效预测工具，减少计算成本。

Abstract: Reduced order models (ROM) can represent spatiotemporal processes in significantly fewer dimensions and can be solved many orders faster than their governing partial differential equations (PDEs). For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves.

TL;DR: 提出一个营销决策框架，将异质处理效应转化为约束性目标策略，在业务护栏限制下最大化收入和留存率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种系统化方法，将因果推断的异质处理效应转化为实际营销决策，同时满足预算、客户体验等业务约束

Method: 使用提升学习器估计条件平均处理效应(CATE)，然后通过约束分配优化决定目标受众和优惠方案，考虑预算、销售下降容忍度等限制

Result: 在留存消息、事件奖励和消费阈值分配等应用中，框架在离线评估中持续优于倾向性和静态基线；在线A/B测试验证了在保持客户体验约束的同时实现收入和完成度的战略提升

Conclusion: 该框架为营销人员提供了一个可重复使用的操作手册，用于规模化实施因果目标定位、设置业务护栏，并使营销活动与战略KPI保持一致

Abstract: This paper introduces a marketing decision framework that converts heterogeneous-treatment uplift into constrained targeting strategies to maximize revenue and retention while honoring business guardrails. The approach estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) with uplift learners and then solves a constrained allocation to decide who to target and which offer to deploy under limits such as budget or acceptable sales deterioration. Applied to retention messaging, event rewards, and spend-threshold assignment, the framework consistently outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS). A production-scale online A/B test further validates strategic lift on revenue and completion while preserving customer-experience constraints. The result is a reusable playbook for marketers to operationalize causal targeting at scale, set guardrails, and align campaigns with strategic KPIs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一方法，将上下文学习直接融入微调过程，结合了两种方法的优势，在少样本和多数据场景下都能取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM适配下游任务主要有两种方法：提示工程（上下文学习）和微调。提示工程在少样本场景表现好但随数据增加效果会饱和，微调随数据增加效果好但在少样本时表现不佳。需要一种统一方法结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出在微调过程中融入上下文学习：使用带有上下文示例的任务特定数据进行微调，模拟k-shot提示的结构。同时提出使用prequential评估进行超参数选择，避免昂贵的交叉验证。

Result: 该方法结合了上下文学习的样本效率和微调的性能增益，在多个下游任务上始终匹配并经常显著超过两种基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的统一方法有效结合了微调和上下文学习的优势，在少样本和多数据场景下都能取得最佳预测性能，为LLM适配下游任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: When adapting large language models (LLMs) to a specific downstream task, two primary approaches are commonly employed: (1) prompt engineering, often with in-context few-shot learning, leveraging the model's inherent generalization abilities, and (2) fine-tuning on task-specific data, directly optimizing the model's parameters. While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了推理时间缩放的理论基础，通过贝叶斯线性回归模型分析推理时间样本数量k对泛化误差的影响，发现当奖励函数与教师模型匹配时，误差随k单调下降，但奖励失配会导致存在最优k值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型将更多计算资源从训练时间转移到推理时间，但推理时间缩放的基本原理尚不明确。本文旨在建立可分析处理的推理时间缩放理论模型，理解推理时间样本数量如何影响模型性能。

Method: 采用贝叶斯线性回归与奖励加权采样器作为可分析模型，在高维状态下研究后验预测均值和方差。分析从教师模型采样的训练数据，通过softmax温度参数选择k个推理时间样本，研究奖励函数与教师模型的匹配程度对泛化误差的影响。

Result: 当奖励函数与教师模型差异不大时，泛化误差随k单调下降；但当奖励失配严重时，存在有限的最优k值，超过该值后更多采样反而会增加误差。对于固定k，存在最优采样温度。在"best-of-k"极限情况下，当奖励为教师模型时，泛化误差以Θ(1/k²)衰减。

Conclusion: 推理时间计算缩放的优势取决于奖励函数与教师模型的匹配程度。理论分析为确定推理时间计算优于收集更多数据的场景提供了依据，并表明任务难度增加会降低推理时间计算的优势。

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models have shown advantages in reallocating a notable share of computational resource from training time to inference time. However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the "best-of-$k$" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.

TL;DR: 提出CGM-FAS深度学习方法替代传统GP方法，用于非遍历性地震动模型中的路径效应建模，能高效处理大规模空间预测并捕捉频率间相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前非遍历性地震动模型依赖高斯过程方法，存在计算限制，难以进行大规模预测。需要更高效的方法来建模空间变化和频率相关性。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器架构，以地震和台站地理坐标为条件变量，直接从数据中学习空间模式和频率间相关性，无需预设相关函数。

Result: CGM-FAS与GP方法预测结果一致，但具有显著优势：无需预设相关函数、能捕捉频率间相关性、计算高效（1万个站点×1千个频率在10秒内完成）。

Conclusion: CGM-FAS为多频率、大空间域的非遍历性地震动预测提供了高效有前景的方向，可替代传统GP方法。

Abstract: Recent developments in non-ergodic ground-motion models (GMMs) explicitly model systematic spatial variations in source, site, and path effects, reducing standard deviation to 30-40% of ergodic models and enabling more accurate site-specific seismic hazard analysis. Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM. This work demonstrates a promising direction for efficient non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains.

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过行为校准训练方法，让LLM在不确定时能够诚实承认不确定性（弃权或标记），从而减少幻觉。该方法使小模型在不确定性量化方面超越前沿大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在关键领域部署受到幻觉问题阻碍。传统RLVR训练范式使用二元奖励信号，无意中鼓励模型在正确概率超过零时就猜测，而不是诚实沟通。需要让模型行为与准确性对齐，在不确定时能够承认不确定性。

Method: 提出行为校准训练方法，优化严格适当评分规则，让模型输出校准后的正确概率。模型可以完全弃权不回答，或标记具体不确定的陈述。使用Qwen3-4B-Instruct进行实证分析。

Result: 行为校准强化学习使小模型在不确定性量化方面超越前沿模型。在数学推理任务上，模型的log-scale准确率-幻觉比率增益(0.806)超过GPT-5(0.207)。在事实QA任务中，4B模型实现与前沿模型相当的零样本校准误差，尽管其事实准确性低得多。

Conclusion: 行为校准是一种可转移的元技能，可与原始预测准确性解耦。该方法使小模型在不确定性量化方面达到前沿大模型水平，为减少LLM幻觉提供了有效途径。

Abstract: LLM deployment in critical domains is currently impeded by persistent hallucinations--generating plausible but factually incorrect assertions. While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME). Moreover, in cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), our 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models including Grok-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, even though its factual accuracy is much lower.

Motivation: 地震学在状态预测和重建（如地震预警和地面运动预测）以及管理源位置、机制和地球模型参数变化方面面临基本挑战。模拟方法受限于大规模数据和数值复杂性，而实际数据方法受限于模型不足和传感器稀疏。现有ML研究缺乏适当的表征、公平报告和严格比较。

Abstract: Seismology faces fundamental challenges in state forecasting and reconstruction (e.g., earthquake early warning and ground motion prediction) and managing the parametric variability of source locations, mechanisms, and Earth models (e.g., subsurface structure and topography effects). Addressing these with simulations is hindered by their massive scale, both in synthetic data volumes and numerical complexity, while real-data efforts are constrained by models that inadequately reflect the Earth's complexity and by sparse sensor measurements from the field. Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes. Our vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets, raising the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融决策系统在非平稳经济环境中运行，但对抗鲁棒性评估通常基于静态假设。需要研究宏观经济压力时期模型脆弱性的系统性变化。

Method: 提出基于波动率的机制分割方法，将经济环境分为平静期和压力期。在保持模型架构、攻击方法和评估协议不变的情况下，评估不同机制下的对抗鲁棒性。引入基于大语言模型的语义审计解释层。

Result: 模型在平静期和压力期的基线预测性能相当，但对抗扰动下，压力期的模型在预测准确性、操作决策阈值和风险敏感结果方面表现出显著更大的性能退化。压力期假阴性率增加，导致高风险案例漏检风险升高。

Conclusion: 金融机器学习中的对抗鲁棒性是机制依赖的属性，需要在高风险金融部署中采用压力感知的模型风险评估方法。

Abstract: Machine learning models used in financial decision systems operate in nonstationary economic environments, yet adversarial robustness is typically evaluated under static assumptions. This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.

We test the method on six datasets: SMS Spam Collection, ECG200, Adult 50K, CDC Diabetes, MNIST, and Fashion MNIST. Four classifiers are used: Extreme Gradient Boosting, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Logistic Regression. Results show that models trained on Bloom filter encodings achieve accuracy similar to models trained on raw data or other transforms. At the same time, the method provides memory savings while enhancing privacy. These results suggest that the Bloom filter transform is an efficient preprocessing approach for diverse machine learning tasks.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI)，通过控制变量法统一DSI和TSI两种分数估计器，实现全噪声谱上的方差最小化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型需要准确估计噪声扰动目标分布的分数。现有两种估计器存在根本性的方差权衡：DSI在低噪声区域方差高，TSI在高噪声区域方差高。需要一种能在整个噪声谱上保持低方差的鲁棒估计器。

Method: 在控制变量法的理论框架下统一DSI和TSI两种估计器，提出Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI)。推导出最优的时变控制系数，理论上保证在整个噪声谱上的方差最小化。

Result: CVSI作为鲁棒的低方差插件估计器，显著提高了无数据采样器学习和推理时扩散采样的样本效率。

Conclusion: 通过控制变量法统一两种分数估计器，解决了扩散模型中分数估计的方差权衡问题，为采样效率提升提供了理论保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a robust framework for sampling from unnormalized probability densities, which requires accurately estimating the score of the noise-perturbed target distribution. While the standard Denoising Score Identity (DSI) relies on data samples, access to the target energy function enables an alternative formulation via the Target Score Identity (TSI). However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.

Motivation: 类别不平衡是机器学习和数据挖掘中的常见挑战，会导致分类器性能下降。尽管深度学习在特征提取方面表现出色，但在不平衡数据下性能仍然会恶化。现有方法通常通过预处理数据修改或后处理校正来解决类别不平衡，但需要在训练阶段嵌入学习层面直接解决这一问题。

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning and data mining, often leading to suboptimal performance in classifiers. While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable forecasting of multivariate time series is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets in digital asset systems. Advanced deep learning methodologies, particularly Transformer-based and MLP-based architectures, have achieved competitive predictive performance in cryptocurrency forecasting tasks. However, cryptocurrency data is inherently composed of long-term socio-economic trends and local high-frequency speculative oscillations. Existing deep learning-based 'black-box' models fail to effectively decouple these composite dynamics or provide the interpretability needed for trustworthy financial decision-making. To overcome these limitations, we propose DecoKAN, an interpretable forecasting framework that integrates multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for decoupling and hierarchical signal decomposition with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) mixers for transparent and interpretable nonlinear modeling. The DWT component decomposes complex cryptocurrency time series into distinct frequency components, enabling frequency-specific analysis, while KAN mixers provide intrinsically interpretable spline-based mappings within each decomposed subseries. Furthermore, interpretability is enhanced through a symbolic analysis pipeline involving sparsification, pruning, and symbolization, which produces concise analytical expressions offering symbolic representations of the learned patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DecoKAN achieves the lowest average Mean Squared Error on all tested real-world cryptocurrency datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), consistently outperforming a comprehensive suite of competitive state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate DecoKAN's potential to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and model transparency, advancing trustworthy decision support within complex cryptocurrency markets.

Abstract: Controllable Markov chains describe the dynamics of sequential decision making tasks and are the central component in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.

TL;DR: PairFlow是一种轻量级预处理方法，用于训练离散流模型（DFMs），实现少步采样而无需预训练教师模型，计算成本极低（仅需完整训练的1.7%）。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散流模型（DFMs）在离散数据生成方面表现出色，但由于迭代特性导致采样速度慢。现有加速方法主要依赖微调，需要大量额外训练开销。需要一种轻量级方法来加速DFMs采样。

Conclusion: PairFlow是一种高效、低成本的DFMs加速方法，在分子数据、二进制图像和RGB图像等任务上展示了广泛适用性和有效性，为离散流模型的实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{PairFlow}$, a lightweight preprocessing step for training Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) to achieve few-step sampling without requiring a pretrained teacher. DFMs have recently emerged as a new class of generative models for discrete data, offering strong performance. However, they suffer from slow sampling due to their iterative nature. Existing acceleration methods largely depend on finetuning, which introduces substantial additional training overhead. $\texttt{PairFlow}$ addresses this issue with a lightweight preprocessing step. Inspired by ReFlow and its extension to DFMs, we train DFMs from coupled samples of source and target distributions, without requiring any pretrained teacher. At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning. Furthermore, models trained with our framework provide stronger base models for subsequent distillation, yielding further acceleration after finetuning. Experiments on molecular data as well as binary and RGB images demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.
  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in structured domains such as road traffic and public transportation, where spatial entities can be naturally represented as fixed nodes. In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how the widely existing contextual and structural divergence may influence the representation learning in rich-text graphs. To this end, we propose Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing (JSDMP), a new learning paradigm for rich-text graph representation learning. Besides considering similarity regarding structure and text, JSDMP further captures their corresponding dissimilarity by Jensen-Shannon divergence. Similarity and dissimilarity are then jointly used to compute new message weights among text nodes, thus enabling representations to learn with contextual and structural information from truly correlated text nodes. With JSDMP, we propose two novel graph neural networks, namely Divergent message-passing graph convolutional network (DMPGCN) and Divergent message-passing Page-Rank graph neural networks (DMPPRG), for learning representations in rich-text graphs. DMPGCN and DMPPRG have been extensively texted on well-established rich-text datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art baselines. The experimental results show that DMPGCN and DMPPRG can outperform other baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed Jensen-Shannon Divergence Message-Passing paradigm

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit problem provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the tension between exploration and exploitation in sequential learning. This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) solve reasoning problems by first generating a rationale and then answering. We formalize reasoning as a latent variable model and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) objective for learning to reason. This view connects EM and modern reward-based optimization, and shows that the main challenge lies in designing a sampling distribution that generates rationales that justify correct answers. We instantiate and compare several sampling schemes: rejection sampling with a budget, self-taught reasoner (STaR), and prompt posterior sampling (PPS), which only keeps the rationalization stage of STaR. Our experiments on the ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with the Llama and Qwen models show that the sampling scheme can significantly affect the accuracy of learned reasoning models. Despite its simplicity, we observe that PPS outperforms the other sampling schemes.

Abstract: Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) simulate daily crop growth by explicitly representing key biophysical processes and project end-of-season yield time series. They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.

Abstract: Federated learning across multi-cloud environments faces critical challenges, including non-IID data distributions, malicious participant detection, and substantial cross-cloud communication costs (egress fees). Existing Byzantine-robust methods focus primarily on model accuracy while overlooking the economic implications of data transfer across cloud providers. This paper presents Cost-TrustFL, a hierarchical federated learning framework that jointly optimizes model performance and communication costs while providing robust defense against poisoning attacks. We propose a gradient-based approximate Shapley value computation method that reduces the complexity from exponential to linear, enabling lightweight reputation evaluation. Our cost-aware aggregation strategy prioritizes intra-cloud communication to minimize expensive cross-cloud data transfers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that Cost-TrustFL achieves 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients while reducing communication costs by 32% compared to baseline methods. The framework maintains stable performance across varying non-IID degrees and attack intensities, making it practical for real-world multi-cloud deployments.

Abstract: We study offline multitask reinforcement learning in settings where multiple tasks share a low-rank representation of their action-value functions. In this regime, a learner is provided with fixed datasets collected from several related tasks, without access to further online interaction, and seeks to exploit shared structure to improve statistical efficiency and generalization. We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch. Together, our results clarify the role of shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning and provide theoretical insight into when and how multitask structure can improve generalization in model-free, value-based reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings) is crucial for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于SFT的LLM在处理表格数据时存在不足：难以应对复杂的多步推理和稳健的代码执行需求。虽然RL有潜力提升这些能力，但在表格领域面临三大挑战：高质量代理轨迹的稀缺、反馈信号的极端异质性、以及垂直专业化过程中的灾难性遗忘风险。

Conclusion: TableGPT-R1通过系统化的RL框架成功解决了表格领域RL应用的三大挑战，实现了对复杂表格的高级推理能力，为表格数据分析提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: Tabular data serves as the backbone of modern data analysis and scientific research. While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成任务中表现出色，但会复制和放大数据集中的偏见。现有研究认为偏见放大是扩散模型的固有特性，但本文首次分析采样算法及其超参数如何影响偏见放大

Method: 通过控制实验，在Biased MNIST、Multi-Color MNIST、BFFHQ数据集和Stable Diffusion模型上，研究不同采样算法及其超参数对偏见放大的影响

Result: 采样算法及其超参数对偏见放大有显著且可测量的影响。即使训练模型固定不变，调整采样超参数也能诱导偏见减少或放大

Conclusion: 扩散模型的偏见放大不是固有特性，而是受采样算法和超参数影响的可控因素。这为通过调整采样过程来减轻偏见提供了新途径

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various image synthesis tasks, yet their tendency to replicate and amplify dataset biases remains poorly understood. Although previous research has viewed bias amplification as an inherent characteristic of diffusion models, this work provides the first analysis of how sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters influence bias amplification. We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

TL;DR: 提出Clust-PSI-PFL框架，使用PSI指标量化非IID数据程度，通过聚类形成分布相似的客户端组，在严重非IID数据下显著提升全局准确率和客户端公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据的非独立同分布特性会导致模型更新偏差和性能下降，需要有效的方法来缓解非IID数据带来的负面影响。

Method: 提出基于聚类的个性化联邦学习框架Clust-PSI-PFL：1) 使用人口稳定性指数PSI量化非IID程度，提出加权PSI指标WPSI^L；2) 基于PSI特征通过K-means++聚类形成分布相似的客户端组；3) 使用轮廓系数法自动确定最优聚类数量。

Result: 在六个数据集（表格、图像、文本）和两种数据划分协议下，Clust-PSI-PFL相比现有方法：1) 全局准确率提升最高达18%；2) 在严重非IID数据下客户端公平性相对提升37%；3) 通常形成少量聚类，开销适中。

Conclusion: PSI引导的聚类是一种原则性、轻量级的机制，能够在标签偏斜下实现鲁棒的个性化联邦学习，有效处理非IID数据问题。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) supports privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning (ML) model training by keeping data on client devices. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.

Conclusion: BrainROI模型通过创新的fMRI编码架构和可解释提示优化，有效解决了多模态脑解码中的跨被试泛化和可解释性问题

Abstract: Multimodal brain decoding aims to reconstruct semantic information that is consistent with visual stimuli from brain activity signals such as fMRI, and then generate readable natural language descriptions. However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动边界系统在工业应用中很常见（如复合材料制造），但传统数值模拟计算成本高，难以实现实时监控和控制。需要开发快速准确的代理模型来支持数字孪生平台。

Method: 采用Deep Operator Network（DeepONet）架构构建移动边界问题的代理模型，结合Ensemble Kalman Inversion（EKI）算法解决贝叶斯反问题。该方法能泛化到任意时空域和传感器配置。

Result: 与完整模型EKI相比，DeepONet代理模型将反演速度提高了数个数量级，实现了实时、准确、高分辨率的参数估计（渗透率、孔隙率等）。

Conclusion: 神经网络算子学习为移动边界系统提供了强大灵活的快速模拟器框架，支持数字孪生平台集成，相比传统网格依赖方法具有更好的泛化能力，是工业数字孪生实用化的重要进展。

Abstract: This work demonstrates that neural operator learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for building fast, accurate emulators of moving boundary systems, enabling their integration into digital twin platforms. To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.
  The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows. Unlike prior approaches for RTM inversion that learn mesh-dependent mappings, the proposed neural operator generalises across spatial and temporal domains, enabling evaluation at arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, and represents a significant step toward practical industrial deployment of digital twins.

Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）旨在通过任务间共享知识来提升泛化能力和参数效率，但平衡资源和减少任务干扰仍是挑战。现有架构方案通常引入复杂的任务特定模块或路由机制，增加了复杂性和开销。

Method: 提出Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TSσBN)，一种轻量级机制，用任务特定的sigmoid门控替代共享的归一化层，使任务能够软分配网络容量，同时完全共享特征提取器。

Result: TSσBN在CNN和Transformer中均能提升稳定性，在NYUv2、Cityscapes、CelebA和PascalContext等数据集上达到或超过现有性能，同时保持高参数效率。学习到的门控为分析MTL动态提供了可解释的框架。

Conclusion: 复杂MTL架构可能是不必要的，任务特定归一化提供了一种简单、可解释且高效的替代方案，仅通过归一化层就能解决多任务学习中的许多挑战。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to leverage shared knowledge across tasks to improve generalization and parameter efficiency, yet balancing resources and mitigating interference remain open challenges. Architectural solutions often introduce elaborate task-specific modules or routing schemes, increasing complexity and overhead. In this work, we show that normalization layers alone are sufficient to address many of these challenges. Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$σ$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors. TS$σ$BN improves stability across CNNs and Transformers, matching or exceeding performance on NYUv2, Cityscapes, CelebA, and PascalContext, while remaining highly parameter-efficient. Moreover, its learned gates provide a natural framework for analyzing MTL dynamics, offering interpretable insights into capacity allocation, filter specialization, and task relationships. Our findings suggest that complex MTL architectures may be unnecessary and that task-specific normalization offers a simple, interpretable, and efficient alternative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经随机微分方程是建模连续时间随机过程的重要框架，GANs为学习SDEs诱导的复杂路径分布提供了有前景的解决方案。但现有方法存在关键瓶颈：设计既能忠实捕捉时间依赖关系又计算高效的判别器。先前使用神经控制微分方程作为判别器的方法计算成本高，且加剧了对抗训练的不稳定性。

Method: 提出HGAN-SDEs框架，利用神经Hermite函数构建结构化且高效的判别器。Hermite函数为近似路径级动态提供了表达性强且轻量级的基础，既能降低运行时复杂度，又能提高训练稳定性。

Result: 建立了该框架对广泛SDE驱动分布类的通用逼近性质，理论上刻画了其收敛行为。在合成和真实世界系统上的广泛实证评估表明，与现有SDE生成模型相比，HGAN-SDEs实现了更优的样本质量和学习效率。

Conclusion: HGAN-SDEs通过神经Hermite函数构建高效判别器，成功解决了传统GAN方法在神经随机微分方程中的计算效率和训练稳定性问题，为连续时间随机过程的生成建模提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) provide a principled framework for modeling continuous-time stochastic processes and have been widely adopted in fields ranging from physics to finance. Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MoE架构存在两个根本限制：1) 结构参数隔离导致灾难性遗忘；2) 指令过拟合在无指令场景下性能下降。需要一种新范式来解决这些问题。

Method: 基于通用权重子空间假设，维护超完备参数主干，通过可学习拓扑掩码雕刻出逻辑专家。利用梯度冲突作为结构监督信号，通过滞后梯度博弈惩罚共享流形中的干扰连接，使拓扑自发剪枝冲突路径并演化出可解释的模块化结构。

Result: CDSP-MoE在没有人工定义任务标签的情况下实现了鲁棒的内容驱动路由，即使在严格的盲推理协议（无显式指令）下也能保持语义专业化。

Conclusion: CDSP-MoE通过从隔离专家容器到共享子空间动态实例化的范式转变，有效解决了MoE的灾难性遗忘和指令过拟合问题，实现了更灵活和鲁棒的专家混合架构。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve parameter efficiency through conditional computation, yet contemporary designs suffer from two fundamental limitations: structural parameter isolation that causes catastrophic forgetting, and instruction-overfitting that degrades performance in instruction-free scenarios. We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FailFast是一个基于扩散大语言模型的推测解码框架，通过动态调整推测长度，在难以推测的区域快速失败以减少计算开销，在容易推测的区域大幅扩展推测长度以减少验证延迟，实现了对自回归LLM的无损加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然提供快速的并行token生成，但单独使用时存在效率与质量的权衡问题。作者发现，如果精心应用，dLLM的特性实际上可以成为推测解码中草稿生成器的优势，因为其并行解码速度大大降低了代价高昂的拒绝风险。

Method: 提出FailFast框架，利用dLLM作为草稿生成器，通过动态调整推测长度实现"快速失败"策略：在难以推测的区域最小化计算开销以减少推测延迟，在容易推测的区域积极扩展草稿长度以减少验证延迟。

Result: 无需微调即可实现自回归LLM的无损加速，相比原始解码达到4.9倍加速，相比最佳朴素dLLM草稿生成器达到1.7倍加速，相比EAGLE-3达到1.4倍加速，在许多情况下能够一次推测并接受70个token。

Conclusion: FailFast展示了dLLM在推测解码中的潜力，通过动态长度调整策略有效解决了dLLM的效率-质量权衡问题，为LLM推理加速提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. We open-source FailFast at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/failfast.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署后的机器学习算法会影响其作用的环境，从而改变底层动态，而标准强化学习方法忽略了这一点。虽然监督学习中已经研究了performative设置下的最优算法设计，但RL中的对应研究仍然不足。

Method: 证明了RL中performative版本的性能差异引理和策略梯度定理，提出了Performative Policy Gradient (PePG)算法。在softmax参数化和有无熵正则化的情况下，证明了PePG能收敛到performatively最优策略。

Result: PePG是首个考虑performative效应的策略梯度算法，能收敛到在自身引起的分布变化下仍然最优的策略，显著优于仅达到performative稳定性的现有方法。在标准performative RL环境中的实证分析验证了PePG优于标准策略梯度算法和现有performative RL算法。

Conclusion: 本文填补了performative RL领域的空白，提出了首个能收敛到performatively最优策略的算法PePG，为处理RL中的分布偏移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Post-deployment machine learning algorithms often influence the environments they act in, and thus shift the underlying dynamics that the standard reinforcement learning (RL) methods ignore. While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.

TL;DR: FedDPC提出了一种新的联邦学习方法，通过将本地更新投影到前一个全局更新上来同时缓解数据异构性和部分客户端参与问题，从而控制方差并加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据异构性和部分客户端参与是现代联邦学习中的两大挑战。数据异构导致本地模型更新方差增大，而部分客户端参与进一步加剧了这一问题，使聚合模型偏向参与客户端的数据分布，导致全局模型偏离最优解，训练不稳定且性能下降。现有研究主要关注数据异构性，对部分客户端参与的影响关注不足。

Method: FedDPC通过两个关键技术：1）将每个本地更新投影到前一个全局更新上，控制本地和全局更新的方差；2）在聚合前对每个本地更新采用自适应缩放，进一步加速训练。

Result: 在多个异构划分数据集上的图像分类任务实验表明，FedDPC优于现有最先进的联邦学习算法，实现了训练损失更快下降和跨通信轮次测试准确率的提升。

Conclusion: FedDPC通过同时解决数据异构性和部分客户端参与问题，有效改善了联邦学习训练稳定性和全局模型性能，为实际部署中的联邦学习系统提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.

Conclusion: 内部强化学习为在基础模型中实现分层强化学习提供了有前景的途径，展示了潜在动作生成和强化在自回归模型中的优势

Abstract: Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term "internal RL", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.

Abstract: Physics-based machine learning blends traditional science with modern data-driven techniques. Rather than relying exclusively on empirical data or predefined equations, this methodology embeds domain knowledge directly into the learning process, resulting in models that are both more accurate and robust. We leverage this paradigm to accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) of the ALICE experiment at CERN. Our method introduces a novel loss function and an output variability-based scaling mechanism, which enhance the model's capability to accurately represent the spatial distribution and morphology of particle showers in detector outputs while mitigating the influence of rare artefacts on the training. Leveraging Normalizing Flows (NFs) in a teacher-student generative framework, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation but also yields models that are 421 times faster than existing NF implementations in ZDC simulation literature.

Abstract: Optimizing maritime operations, particularly fuel consumption for vessels, is crucial, considering its significant share in global trade. As fuel consumption is closely related to the shaft power of a vessel, predicting shaft power accurately is a crucial problem that requires careful consideration to minimize costs and emissions. Traditional approaches, which incorporate empirical formulas, often struggle to model dynamic conditions, such as sea conditions or fouling on vessels. In this paper, we present a hybrid, physics-guided neural network-based approach that utilizes empirical formulas within the network to combine the advantages of both neural networks and traditional techniques. We evaluate the presented method using data obtained from four similar-sized cargo vessels and compare the results with those of a baseline neural network and a traditional approach that employs empirical formulas. The experimental results demonstrate that the physics-guided neural network approach achieves lower mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error for all tested vessels compared to both the empirical formula-based method and the base neural network.

Motivation: 需要能直接在连续地球物理场上操作并保持其几何结构的机器学习架构，以实现准确且物理一致的地球系统动力学建模

Method: 引入Field-Space Attention机制，在物理域计算注意力；使用固定的非学习多尺度分解；学习输入场的结构保持变形；在HEALPix网格上进行全球温度超分辨率应用

Result: 相比传统Vision Transformer和U-Net基线，Field-Space Transformer收敛更快更稳定，参数更少；能直接嵌入物理和统计先验，提高数据驱动地球系统建模的保真度和可靠性

Conclusion: Field-Space Attention是紧凑、可解释且物理基础良好的构建块，适用于下一代地球系统预测和生成建模框架

Abstract: Accurate and physically consistent modeling of Earth system dynamics requires machine-learning architectures that operate directly on continuous geophysical fields and preserve their underlying geometric structure. Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理复杂几何形状和不同操作状态时，难以保持准确性和鲁棒性。需要一种能够统一几何感知上下文与物理注意力机制的可扩展Transformer，用于高保真代理建模。

Method: 使用GALE注意力机制替代标准注意力，将学习状态切片的物理感知自注意力与多尺度球查询计算的共享几何/全局/边界条件上下文交叉注意力相结合。通过NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo实现，持续将几何、全局和边界条件参数投影到物理状态空间。

Conclusion: GeoTransolver通过统一多尺度几何感知上下文与基于物理的注意力，在可扩展Transformer中推进了操作学习，为复杂不规则域和非线性物理体系的高保真代理建模提供了先进解决方案。

Abstract: We present GeoTransolver, a Multiscale Geometry-Aware Physics Attention Transformer for CAE that replaces standard attention with GALE, coupling physics-aware self-attention on learned state slices with cross-attention to a shared geometry/global/boundary-condition context computed from multi-scale ball queries (inspired by DoMINO) and reused in every block. Implemented and released in NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, GeoTransolver persistently projects geometry, global and boundary condition parameters into physical state spaces to anchor latent computations to domain structure and operating regimes. We benchmark GeoTransolver on DrivAerML, Luminary SHIFT-SUV, and Luminary SHIFT-Wing, comparing against Domino, Transolver (as released in PhysicsNeMo), and literature-reported AB-UPT, and evaluate drag/lift R2 and Relative L1 errors for field variables. GeoTransolver delivers better accuracy, improved robustness to geometry/regime shifts, and favorable data efficiency; we include ablations on DrivAerML and qualitative results such as contour plots and design trends for the best GeoTransolver models. By unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention in a scalable transformer, GeoTransolver advances operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling across complex, irregular domains and non-linear physical regimes.

*Xuan-An Le,Minh-Nam Tran,Son Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRIDGE是一个两阶段知识蒸馏框架，通过引入中等规模的教师助手(TA)来解决大模型到小模型(小于1B参数)的知识蒸馏中的容量差距和API成本问题，仅使用3-5%的数据就能显著提升小模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大型专有模型(如GPT-4)向可部署的小型模型(小于1B参数)进行知识蒸馏面临两个关键问题：1) 教师和学生之间1000倍的容量差距阻碍了直接知识转移；2) API成本限制了大规模数据收集。需要一种预算感知的方法来解决这些约束。

Method: BRIDGE采用两阶段框架：第一阶段，中等规模的教师助手(TA，约7B参数)在严格限制的数据子集(3-5%)上从黑盒教师学习，数据选择使用零API成本管道，通过本地TA推理平衡熵难度和语义多样性；第二阶段，利用TA推理免费的优势，TA为完整数据集生成合成推理过程来训练小型学生模型，并采用指令调优课程来建立行为对齐。

Result: 在医疗、法律和金融基准测试中，BRIDGE使学生模型性能提升28-41%，将能力差距缩小12-16%，同时使用10倍更少的教师查询。BRIDGE超越了使用100%预算的直接蒸馏基线，仅消耗5%的资源。

Conclusion: BRIDGE通过战略性的中间层和预算不对称性，有效解决了大模型到小模型知识蒸馏的容量差距和成本问题，打破了传统的成本-性能边界，为资源受限环境下的高效模型部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Distilling knowledge from large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) to tiny deployable models (less than 1B parameters) faces a critical capacity-budget trap: the 1000x capacity gap between teachers and students prevents effective direct transfer, while API costs prohibit extensive data collection. We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动应用和网站的用户挫折会导致销售损失和投诉，企业需要预测和识别用户挫折以改善用户体验和业务表现。

Method: 使用真实电商网站的点击流数据（540万原始事件，304,881个会话），基于愤怒点击、来回导航、购物车流失、搜索困难和长时间徘徊等规则定义挫折会话。构建表格特征训练标准分类器，同时使用完整事件序列训练判别式LSTM分类器。

Result: XGBoost达到约90%准确率和0.9579 ROC AUC，LSTM表现最佳，达到约91%准确率和0.9705 ROC AUC。研究还显示LSTM仅需前20-30次交互即可可靠预测挫折。

Conclusion: 点击流数据可用于有效预测用户挫折，LSTM模型在序列数据处理上表现优异，且能在会话早期进行可靠预测，为实时干预提供可能。

Abstract: Many businesses depend on their mobile apps and websites, so user frustration while trying to complete a task on these channels can cause lost sales and complaints. In this research, I use clickstream data from a real e-commerce site to predict whether a session is frustrated or not. Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier. XGBoost reaches about 90% accuracy, ROC AUC of 0.9579, while the LSTM performs best with about 91% accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.9705. Finally, the research shows that with only the first 20 to 30 interactions, the LSTM already predicts frustration reliably.

Abstract: Recurrent off-policy deep reinforcement learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance but are often sidelined due to their high computational demands. In response, we introduce RISE (Recurrent Integration via Simplified Encodings), a novel approach that can leverage recurrent networks in any image-based off-policy RL setting without significant computational overheads via using both learnable and non-learnable encoder layers. When integrating RISE into leading non-recurrent off-policy RL algorithms, we observe a 35.6% human-normalized interquartile mean (IQM) performance improvement across the Atari benchmark. We analyze various implementation strategies to highlight the versatility and potential of our proposed framework.

Motivation: 时间序列预测对规划和决策至关重要，可解释性对于建立用户信任和满足透明度要求很关键。现有的SHAP框架缺乏针对时间序列的高效实现，且在采样反事实时通常假设特征独立性。

Method: 提出SHAPformer模型，基于Transformer架构，通过注意力机制操作使模型能够基于特征子集进行预测，从而生成解释。该方法无需采样，直接利用注意力权重计算特征重要性。

Result: SHAPformer在1秒内生成解释，比SHAP排列解释器快几个数量级。在具有真实解释的合成数据上，SHAPformer提供与数据相符的解释。在真实世界电力负荷数据上，实现了有竞争力的预测性能，并提供了有意义的局部和全局洞察。

Conclusion: SHAPformer是一个准确、快速且免采样的可解释时间序列预测模型，能够高效生成有意义的解释，识别关键预测因子（如历史负荷），并揭示特定时期（如圣诞节期间）的模型行为模式。

Abstract: Time-series forecasts are essential for planning and decision-making in many domains. Explainability is key to building user trust and meeting transparency requirements. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period.

Abstract: Hand-tagged training data is essential to many machine learning tasks. However, training data quality control has received little attention in the literature, despite data quality varying considerably with the tagging exercise. We propose methods to evaluate and enhance the quality of hand-tagged training data using statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement. We show that agreement metrics give more reliable results if recorded over multiple iterations of tagging, where declining variance in such recordings is an indicator of increasing data quality. We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors.

Conclusion: ReLU神经网络具有博弈论解释，该框架可扩展到Softplus激活函数，为神经网络分析提供新视角和工具

Abstract: We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.

Conclusion: 该理论为理解梯度下降何时以及为何逐步学习越来越复杂的解提供了一个统一框架，解耦了先前混淆的因素，并解释了不同架构中的简单性偏置现象。

Abstract: Neural networks trained with gradient descent often learn solutions of increasing complexity over time, a phenomenon known as simplicity bias. Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions.

Abstract: Advances in LLMs have produced agents with knowledge and operational capabilities comparable to human scientists, suggesting potential to assist, accelerate, and automate research. However, existing studies mainly evaluate such systems on well-defined benchmarks or general tasks like literature retrieval, limiting their end-to-end problem-solving ability in open scientific scenarios. This is particularly true in physics, which is abstract, mathematically intensive, and requires integrating analytical reasoning with code-based computation. To address this, we propose PhysMaster, an LLM-based agent functioning as an autonomous theoretical and computational physicist. PhysMaster couples absract reasoning with numerical computation and leverages LANDAU, the Layered Academic Data Universe, which preserves retrieved literature, curated prior knowledge, and validated methodological traces, enhancing decision reliability and stability. It also employs an adaptive exploration strategy balancing efficiency and open-ended exploration, enabling robust performance in ultra-long-horizon tasks. We evaluate PhysMaster on problems from high-energy theory, condensed matter theory to astrophysics, including: (i) acceleration, compressing labor-intensive research from months to hours; (ii) automation, autonomously executing hypothesis-driven loops ; and (iii) autonomous discovery, independently exploring open problems.

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

Motivation: 解决PlantCLEF 2025挑战中的细粒度多标签物种识别问题，需要从高分辨率植被图像中同时识别多个物种，传统方法难以有效处理此类任务

Method: 1) 从训练数据提取特征并用K-Means聚类生成类别原型；2) 构建定制化窄ViT，用冻结的DinoV2替换patch embedding层；3) 训练模型从测试图像重建训练数据的类别原型；4) 利用注意力分数识别感兴趣区域并指导分类

Conclusion: 提出的基于类别原型和分割ViT的方法能够有效实现从单物种多类别识别到高分辨率植被图像多标签分类的领域适应，在细粒度物种识别任务中具有竞争力

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

Conclusion: 通过类内聚类学习细粒度特征的方法能够有效缓解细粒度视觉分类中的类内变异问题，在PlantNet300k数据集上表现出色，为未来研究提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

Method: 提出S³IT基准，核心是新颖的座位排序任务：在3D环境中为具有不同身份、偏好和复杂人际关系的LLM驱动NPC安排座位。使用可扩展的程序化框架生成多样化场景，要求智能体通过主动对话获取偏好、自主探索感知环境、在复杂约束网络中进行多目标优化。

Result: 评估最先进的LLMs发现它们在S³IT上表现不佳，与人类基线有明显差距。结果表明LLMs在空间智能方面存在缺陷，但在处理具有明确文本线索的冲突时能达到接近人类水平的能力。

Conclusion: S³IT填补了具身社会智能评估的空白，揭示了当前LLMs在整合物理和社交约束方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

Conclusion: LieFlow能够直接从数据中学习对称性，为理解物理系统和提升机器学习性能提供了有效工具。解决了对称性发现中的关键挑战，具有更广泛的适用性

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

Conclusion: SOF成功桥接了视频生成模型与机器人动作之间的鸿沟，通过光流表示的技能学习实现了从视频到动作的有效转换和高层规划

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

TL;DR: 本文通过强化学习将通用语言模型转化为专业的内容审核分类器，在标签稀疏、政策动态变化的现实场景中，RL展现出sigmoid式扩展特性，相比监督微调实现高达100倍的数据效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模内容审核是数字生态系统中最紧迫的挑战之一，需要持续评估数十亿用户和AI生成内容是否违反政策。虽然大语言模型在基于政策的审核方面显示出潜力，但在标签稀疏、政策定义动态变化、需要超越浅层模式匹配的复杂推理等现实场景中，如何训练这些系统达到专家级准确度仍未被充分探索。

Conclusion: 强化学习为工业级内容审核系统提供了可行的解决方案，特别是在标签稀疏和政策动态变化的场景中，通过RL训练可以实现高效的政策对齐分类，为实际应用提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

Motivation: 当前临床决策支持系统面临关键挑战：在实现高预测准确性的同时生成与预测一致的解释。现有方法存在暴露偏差问题，导致解释与预测不一致。

Method: 提出Reason2Decide两阶段训练框架：第一阶段训练模型生成解释；第二阶段联合训练标签预测和解释生成，应用计划采样从基于黄金标签逐步过渡到基于模型预测。

Result: 在三个医疗数据集上评估，包括专有分诊数据集和公共生物医学QA数据集。Reason2Decide在预测（F1）和解释保真度（BERTScore、BLEU、LLM-as-a-Judge）方面优于其他微调基线。在分诊任务中，对LLM生成、护士撰写和护士后处理的解释都表现稳健。

Conclusion: Reason2Decide使用比当代基础模型小40倍的模型实现了这些优势，使临床推理在资源受限部署中更易实现，同时提供可解释的决策支持。LLM生成的解释适合预训练模型，减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.

Motivation: 分子编辑和优化是多步骤问题，需要迭代改进属性同时保持化学有效性和结构相似性。现有方法缺乏将分子设计形式化为智能体强化学习问题的框架，无法有效结合推理、工具使用和分子优化。

Conclusion: 将分子设计视为多步骤、工具增强的过程是实现可靠且可解释改进的关键。MolAct框架首次将分子设计形式化为智能体强化学习问题，展示了智能体学习交织推理、工具使用和分子优化的潜力。

Abstract: Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.

Motivation: 现有研究通常需要微调专门模块来桥接时间序列数据与大语言模型预训练知识之间的差距，但完全冻结（不微调）的大语言模型性能对输入数据的文本表示非常敏感。本文旨在探索如何在不进行任何微调的情况下，直接利用现成的大语言模型进行时间序列预测。

Method: 提出一种简单有效的策略：在时间序列数据文本化之前注入噪声。这种非侵入式干预作为一种推理时增强手段，迫使冻结的大语言模型基于稳健的底层时间模式而非表面数值伪影进行外推。同时引入两个全新时间序列数据集以消除大语言模型预训练数据污染带来的潜在偏差。

Result: 理论分析和实证验证表明，注入噪声的方法在多样化基准测试中有效提升了性能。在新引入的数据集上，该方法也表现出持续的性能改进，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 本研究为直接利用现成大语言模型进行时间序列预测提供了进一步进展，展示了通过简单的噪声注入策略可以克服冻结模型对输入表示的脆弱性，从而提升预测性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 比较人类与大型语言模型在数字游戏概念推理任务中的泛化能力，发现人类更灵活地结合规则与相似性推理，而LLMs更依赖数学规则，且人类具有更强的少样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类与大型语言模型在概念推理任务中的泛化能力差异，探索两者在归纳偏置和推理策略上的根本区别，为理解人工智能与人类认知的差异提供实证基础。

Method: 使用数字游戏作为概念推理任务，以贝叶斯模型为分析框架，比较人类与LLMs的归纳偏置和推理策略，分析两者在规则推理和相似性推理上的差异。

Result: 贝叶斯模型能更好地捕捉人类行为：人类灵活结合规则推理和相似性推理，而LLMs更依赖数学规则；人类能从单个示例进行少样本泛化，而LLMs需要更多样本才能泛化。

Conclusion: 人类与LLMs在数学概念推理和泛化上存在根本差异，人类具有更灵活的推理策略和更强的少样本学习能力，这揭示了当前AI系统与人类认知的重要差距。

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PreSa方法，通过直接学习策略而非间接学习奖励/成本模型，结合偏好学习和安全对齐，在离线偏好强化学习中实现安全策略学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线偏好强化学习(PbRL)避免了人工奖励工程和实时交互，但安全性仍是关键挑战。现有基于人类反馈的安全RL方法先学习奖励/成本模型再使用约束RL，但在长时域连续控制任务中，奖励和成本的误差会累积，导致性能下降

Method: 提出PreSa框架：1) 直接基于行为偏好和轨迹段安全标签学习策略；2) 将偏好学习模块与安全对齐结合为约束优化问题；3) 在拉格朗日框架下求解，直接学习奖励最大化且安全的策略，无需显式学习奖励/成本模型，也避免了约束RL

Result: 在连续控制任务上，使用合成和真实人类反馈进行评估。实验表明，该方法成功学习到高奖励的安全策略，优于现有最先进基线，甚至优于使用真实奖励和成本的离线安全RL方法

Conclusion: PreSa方法通过直接学习策略而非间接学习奖励/成本模型，有效解决了离线偏好强化学习中的安全对齐问题，在连续控制任务中表现出色

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MemR³：一个具有闭环控制的自主记忆检索系统，通过路由器和证据缺口跟踪机制优化LLM代理的回答质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆系统主要优化压缩和存储，缺乏对记忆检索的显式闭环控制。需要构建自主、准确、兼容的记忆检索系统来提升LLM代理的回答质量。

Method: MemR³系统包含两个核心机制：1）路由器在检索、反思和回答三个动作中选择以优化答案质量；2）全局证据缺口跟踪器显式呈现回答过程并跟踪证据收集过程。该系统采用闭环控制机制，不同于传统的检索-回答流水线。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准测试中，MemR³超越了强基线模型，在LLM-as-a-Judge评分上表现优异。特别地，它改进了四类现有检索器，使用GPT-4.1-mini后端时，在RAG上整体提升7.29%，在Zep上提升1.94%。

Conclusion: MemR³为现有记忆存储提供了一个即插即用的控制器，通过引入闭环控制机制实现了自主决策，显著提升了记忆检索系统的性能。

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

TL;DR: G-SPEC是一个神经符号框架，通过确定性验证约束概率规划，解决5G/6G网络中LLM代理的随机风险问题，在450节点5G核心网模拟中实现零安全违规和94.1%的修复成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 5G独立组网和6G演进中，运营商面临超出静态自动化和深度强化学习能力的编排挑战。虽然大语言模型代理提供了基于意图的网络管理路径，但它们引入了拓扑幻觉和政策不合规等随机风险。

Method: 提出Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC)神经符号框架，通过治理三元组（电信适配代理TSLAM-4B、网络知识图谱NKG和SHACL约束）约束概率规划。

Result: 在450节点5G核心网模拟中实现零安全违规和94.1%的修复成功率，显著优于82.4%的基线。可扩展性测试显示验证延迟按O(k^1.2)扩展，处理开销142ms，适合SMO层操作。

Conclusion: G-SPEC通过神经符号方法有效缓解了LLM代理在网络编排中的随机风险，结合NKG验证和SHACL约束确保了安全合规，为5G/6G网络自动化提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations.

Motivation: 当前VLA模型在边缘设备上推理延迟高（仅3-5Hz），远低于机器人交互所需的20-30Hz，现有优化方法要么需要大量重训练，要么会牺牲模型精度

Method: 提出ActionFlow系统级推理框架，核心是跨请求流水线策略，将VLA推理重新定义为微请求的宏流水线；通过跨请求状态打包前向算子和统一KV环形缓冲区，将碎片化内存操作融合为高效密集计算

Result: 在OpenVLA-7B模型上实现2.55倍的FPS提升，无需重训练即可在边缘硬件上实现实时动态操作

Conclusion: ActionFlow有效解决了VLA模型在边缘设备上的高延迟问题，通过创新的调度策略和内存优化，实现了实时性能，为机器人动态交互提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Motivation: 虽然CodeMem确立了可执行代码作为代理程序记忆的最佳表示形式，但从空白状态自主合成这种记忆的机制仍未充分探索。需要将大语言模型从被动的工具使用者转变为主动的工作流架构师。

Method: 通过Outlook和OneDrive跨服务编排任务的高保真案例研究，识别并解决技能自动生成中的四个结构性瓶颈：发现差距（导航大型工具注册表）、验证差距（基础工具响应结构）、分解差距（用线性状态锚定替代低效搜索）和扩展差距（关注并发性和持久性）。强制执行假设、探测和编码的科学方法论。

Result: 通过强制执行假设、探测和编码的科学方法论，代理能够自主编写健壮的生产级代码技能。

Conclusion: 通过解决技能自动生成中的四个关键瓶颈，并采用科学方法论，可以实现LLM从被动工具使用者到主动工作流架构师的转变，使代理能够自主合成生产级代码技能。

Abstract: While CodeMem establishes executable code as the optimal representation for agentic procedural memory, the mechanism for autonomously synthesizing this memory from a blank slate remains underexplored. This paper operationalizes the transition of Large Language Models from passive tool-users to active workflow architects. Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.

TL;DR: SynCraft是一个基于大语言模型推理的框架，将合成可行性优化重构为精确的结构编辑问题，通过预测原子级编辑序列而非直接生成SMILES，在保持结构新颖性的同时显著提高分子合成可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI虽然革新了化学空间探索，但大量生成的分子合成不可行。现有方法（如后过滤或投影方法）往往损害结构新颖性或破坏关键药效团。需要一种能精确编辑分子结构以提升合成可行性的方法。

Method: SynCraft将合成可行性优化重构为结构编辑问题而非序列翻译任务。利用大语言模型的推理能力，预测可执行的原子级编辑序列，避免直接生成SMILES的语法脆弱性。通过交互感知提示，复制药物化学专家的编辑直觉。

Result: 在广泛基准测试中，SynCraft在生成高结构保真度的可合成类似物方面优于最先进的基线方法。成功复制了PLK1抑制剂的专家药物化学编辑直觉，并拯救了先前分子生成文献中评分高但被丢弃的RIPK1候选分子。

Conclusion: SynCraft通过将合成可行性优化重构为精确的结构编辑问题，利用大语言模型的推理能力，有效解决了"合成悬崖"问题，在保持结构新颖性的同时显著提升分子合成可行性，展示了在药物发现中的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has revolutionized the exploration of chemical space, yet a critical bottleneck remains that a substantial fraction of generated molecules is synthetically inaccessible. Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the "synthesis cliff" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.

Abstract: A global shortage of radiologists has been exacerbated by the significant volume of chest X-ray workloads, particularly in primary care. Although multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT07117266). Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions.

To support this new paradigm, the study constructs the first large-scale dataset for generative digital twins, comprising over 120,000 prompt-sketch-code triplets that enable multimodal learning between textual descriptions, spatial structures, and simulation logic. In parallel, three novel evaluation metrics, Structural Validity Rate (SVR), Parameter Match Rate (PMR), and Execution Success Rate (ESR), are proposed specifically for this task to comprehensively evaluate structural integrity, parameter fidelity, and simulator executability. Through systematic ablation across vision encoders, connectors, and code-pretrained language backbones, the proposed models achieve near-perfect structural accuracy and high execution robustness. This work establishes a foundation for generative digital twins that integrate visual reasoning and language understanding into executable industrial simulation systems.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

TL;DR: LLMs在预测临床休克事件中表现与传统SLMs相当，GatorTron-Base获得最高加权召回率80.5%，但整体性能差异不大，表明LLMs在预测临床事件方面并非天生优于SLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在自然语言处理领域取得显著进展，但在预测性任务中的应用研究相对较少。本研究旨在探索LLMs在预测危重患者休克事件中的表现，并与传统小语言模型进行比较，以评估LLMs在临床预测任务中的实际价值。

Method: 使用MIMIC III数据库中17,294次ICU住院的文本数据，筛选出住院时间>24小时且休克指数>0.7的患者（正常组355人，异常组87人）。比较了GatorTron-Base（临床数据训练）、Llama 8B、Mistral 7B等LLMs与BioBERT、DocBERT、BioClinicalBERT、Word2Vec、Doc2Vec等SLMs。采用焦点损失和交叉熵损失进行微调以处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: GatorTron-Base获得了最高的加权召回率80.5%，但整体性能指标显示LLMs和SLMs之间的表现相当。这表明尽管LLMs在文本任务上表现出色，但在预测未来临床事件方面并不比SLMs有显著优势。

Conclusion: LLMs在预测临床事件方面并非天生优于SLMs。为实现有意义的临床结果，未来训练LLMs应重点开发能够预测临床轨迹的模型，而不是专注于命名实体识别或表型分类等简单任务。

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

TL;DR: 研究测试了链式思维推理能否改善脑转移瘤立体定向放射外科的自动化治疗计划，发现推理模型在保持主要剂量指标的同时降低了耳蜗剂量，并产生了可审计的规划过程记录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 立体定向放射外科需要精确的剂量分布，但黑盒AI系统因不透明性限制了临床采用。研究旨在探索链式思维推理是否能提高自动化规划系统的透明度和性能。

Method: 开发了基于大语言模型的SAGE规划代理，在41例脑转移瘤患者的回顾性队列中测试。比较了推理模型和非推理模型两个变体，评估主要终点包括靶区覆盖率、最大剂量、适形指数和梯度指数。

Result: 推理模型在主要剂量指标上与人工规划者相当（所有p>0.21），同时将耳蜗剂量降低至人工基线以下（p=0.022）。推理模型展示了前瞻性约束验证（457次）和权衡考量（609次）等系统性规划行为，而非推理模型几乎没有这些思考过程。

Conclusion: 链式思维推理不仅保持了计划质量，还通过产生可审计的优化轨迹提高了自动化规划的透明度，为临床采用提供了可信路径。

Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) demands precise dose shaping around critical structures, yet black-box AI systems have limited clinical adoption due to opacity concerns. We tested whether chain-of-thought reasoning improves agentic planning in a retrospective cohort of 41 patients with brain metastases treated with 18 Gy single-fraction SRS. We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent. The optimization traces serve as auditable logs, offering a path toward transparent automated planning.

Conclusion: 该多智能体设计通过定位帮助主代理关注相关片段，用视觉细节补充字幕，并产生可解释的轨迹，在长视频QA任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.

Abstract: Student engagement is a critical factor influencing academic success and learning outcomes. Accurately predicting student engagement is essential for optimizing teaching strategies and providing personalized interventions. However, most approaches focus on single-dimensional feature analysis and assessing engagement based on individual student factors. In this work, we propose a dual-stream multi-feature fusion model based on hypergraph convolutional networks (DS-HGCN), incorporating social contagion of student engagement. DS-HGCN enables accurate prediction of student engagement states by modeling multi-dimensional features and their propagation mechanisms between students. The framework constructs a hypergraph structure to encode engagement contagion among students and captures the emotional and behavioral differences and commonalities by multi-frequency signals. Furthermore, we introduce a hypergraph attention mechanism to dynamically weigh the influence of each student, accounting for individual differences in the propagation process. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.
