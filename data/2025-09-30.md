### [1] [RCI: A Score for Evaluating Global and Local Reasoning in Multimodal Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23673)
*Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel,Srikant Panda,Hansa Meghwani,Jyotika Singh,Karan Dua,Paul Li,Tao Sheng,Sujith Ravi,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了区域理解指数(RCI)，这是首个基于模型的评分方法，用于直接量化数据集对全局与局部视觉信息的依赖程度，揭示了多数多模态基准测试偏向局部推理并存在显著空间偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法明确区分多模态大语言模型是依赖全局推理还是局部视觉线索，阻碍了有效数据集构建和面向现实世界的模型开发。

Method: 通过系统比较参考模型在图像块与完整图像上的性能表现，RCI能够揭示任务是否需要整体图像理解，还是可以通过部分或局部视觉线索解决。

Result: 将RCI应用于13个广泛使用的多模态基准测试，发现大多数基准偏向局部推理并存在显著空间偏差，表明在现实世界应用中存在潜在风险。

Conclusion: RCI为研究人员和从业者提供了可操作的工具，用于诊断和缓解这些偏差，从而构建能够促进稳健、企业级多模态系统发展的数据集和基准测试。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

### [2] [Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22674)
*Yash Thube*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MATS行为审计框架，用于评估视觉语言模型在视觉矛盾陈述上的表现，发现生成式VLMs存在严重的空间一致性失败，而对比式编码器更为稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基准测试可能掩盖系统性的失败，影响实际应用中的可信度，需要更细粒度的行为审计来评估模型对视觉矛盾陈述的拒绝能力。

Method: 引入MATS行为审计框架，包含空间一致性评分(SCS)和错误同意率(IAR)两个指标，通过激活修补技术定位失败原因。

Result: 指令调优的生成式VLMs(LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat)表现出极低的SCS和很高的IAR，而对比式编码器(CLIP, SigLIP)则稳健得多。激活修补定位到生成式模型失败于中晚期交叉注意力层，对比式模型失败于池化投影组件。

Conclusion: 生成式VLMs在视觉矛盾检测方面存在系统性缺陷，但通过激活修补可以定位失败点并提供具体的修复路径，对比式编码器在此任务上表现更好。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

### [3] [Scale and Rotation Estimation of Similarity-Transformed Images via Cross-Correlation Maximization Based on Auxiliary Function Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22686)
*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效算法，能够以亚像素精度联合估计两幅图像之间的尺度和旋转变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像配准在医学成像和计算机视觉中至关重要，但传统相位相关技术只能处理平移偏移，无法有效处理相机缩放或旋转引起的尺度和旋转变化。

Method: 结合了对数极坐标下的傅里叶变换与互相关最大化策略，利用辅助函数方法，并引入亚像素级互相关来实现精确估计。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在尺度和旋转估计上的平均误差低于传统的基于离散互相关的傅里叶变换技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效且精确地联合估计图像间的尺度和旋转变化，优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

### [4] [PCRI: Measuring Context Robustness in Multimodal Models for Enterprise Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23879)
*Hitesh Laxmichand Patel,Amit Agarwal,Srikant Panda,Hansa Meghwani,Karan Dua,Paul Li,Tao Sheng,Sujith Ravi,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PCRI指标，首次系统量化多模态大语言模型对视觉上下文变化的鲁棒性，发现大多数领先模型对背景噪声敏感，只有少数模型表现稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标无法捕捉多模态大语言模型对无关或干扰性视觉上下文的敏感性，这影响了模型在真实场景中的可靠性。

Method: 引入PCRI指标，通过比较模型在局部图像块和完整图像输入上的性能变化，系统评估模型对视觉上下文粒度变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 对19个先进MLLM在15个基准测试上应用PCRI，发现大多数模型对背景噪声脆弱，只有InternVL2-26B和Qwen2VL-72B等少数模型在不同任务中表现一致鲁棒。

Conclusion: PCRI能够严格比较上下文鲁棒性，为研究人员和从业者提供可操作的诊断见解，支持有原则的模型选择并指导未来架构和训练策略的开发。

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

### [5] [Robust Object Detection for Autonomous Driving via Curriculum-Guided Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22688)
*Xu Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强GRPO的强化学习框架，通过课程数据调度和难度感知过滤，在稀疏噪声奖励下稳定优化并逐步适应复杂样本，显著提升了自动驾驶基准测试中的检测精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言推理方面表现出色，但在需要精确定位和鲁棒性的结构化感知任务中表现不佳。

Method: 基于课程的数据调度和难度感知过滤的强化学习框架，增强组相对策略优化(GRPO)，在稀疏噪声奖励下稳定优化。

Result: 在自动驾驶基准测试中显示出检测精度和鲁棒性的显著提升，消融研究确认了奖励设计、KL正则化和课程节奏对收敛稳定性和泛化的重要性。

Conclusion: 强化驱动优化与结构化数据课程是通往鲁棒可解释多模态检测的可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning
but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise
localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that
augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data
scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes
optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to
complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum
pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight
reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable
path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

### [6] [From Satellite to Street: A Hybrid Framework Integrating Stable Diffusion and PanoGAN for Consistent Cross-View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24369)
*Khawlah Bajbaa,Abbas Anwar,Muhammad Saqib,Hafeez Anwar,Nabin Sharma,Muhammad Usman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合扩散模型和条件GAN的混合框架，从卫星图像生成地理一致的街景图像，在CVUSA数据集上表现优于纯扩散方法，与最先进的GAN方法相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 街景图像是地理空间数据收集和城市分析的重要来源，但从卫星图像合成街景图像面临外观和视角差异的挑战，需要开发能够生成地理一致街景的方法。

Method: 采用多阶段训练策略，将Stable Diffusion作为双分支架构的核心组件，集成条件GAN来生成地理一致的街景全景图，并实施融合策略结合两种模型的优势。

Result: 在CVUSA数据集上的实验表明，该混合方法在多个评估指标上优于纯扩散方法，与最先进的GAN方法性能相当，能生成真实且几何一致的街景图像，保留街道标记、次要道路和云层等细节。

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架成功解决了卫星到街景图像合成的挑战，通过结合扩散模型和GAN的优势，生成了高质量的地理一致街景图像，为城市分析和地理空间数据收集提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as
clouds.

### [7] [Graph-Theoretic Consistency for Robust and Topology-Aware Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22689)
*Ha-Hieu Pham,Minh Le,Han Huynh,Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le,Huy-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出拓扑图一致性(TGC)框架，通过图论约束改进半监督语义分割，在病理图像上取得SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督语义分割在计算病理学中很重要，但现有方法依赖像素级一致性，容易传播噪声伪标签并产生碎片化或拓扑无效的掩码

Method: TGC框架集成图论约束，通过对齐预测图和参考图的拉普拉斯谱、组件数量和邻接统计来强制全局拓扑一致性

Result: 在GlaS和CRAG数据集上的实验表明，TGC在5-10%监督下达到最先进性能，显著缩小与全监督的差距

Conclusion: TGC通过拓扑图一致性有效提升了半监督语义分割的性能，特别是在计算病理学应用中

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at
https://github.com/hieuphamha19/TGC.

### [8] [SkyLink: Unifying Street-Satellite Geo-Localization via UAV-Mediated 3D Scene Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24783)
*Hongyang Zhang,Yinhao Liu,Zhenyu Kuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SkyLink方法解决跨视角地理定位问题，通过数据增强、局部特征聚合和3D场景信息整合，在极端视角差异下实现稳健的特征检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过直接特征相似度匹配学习跨视角相关性，但忽略了极端视角差异导致的语义退化问题。

Method: 使用Google检索增强模块对街景图像进行数据增强；采用Patch-Aware特征聚合模块强调局部特征聚合；整合多尺度无人机图像构建的3D场景信息作为桥梁；通过自监督和跨视角对比学习进行特征对齐。

Result: 在UAVM2025挑战赛的University-1652数据集上达到25.75%的Recall@1准确率，在多样化城市场景中表现出稳健性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SkyLink方法有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的视角差异问题，通过创新的特征提取和3D信息整合实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$
Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 in the UAVM2025 Challenge. Code will be
released at https://github.com/HRT00/CVGL-3D.

### [9] [A review of Recent Techniques for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22690)
*Andrea Asperti,Salvatore Fiorilla,Simone Nardi,Lorenzo Orsini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文是一篇关于行人重识别(ReID)的综述，主要对比了监督学习和无监督学习方法，指出监督方法性能接近极限，而无监督方法近年来发展迅速，性能差距正在缩小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习方法依赖大量标注数据，存在可扩展性和计算成本问题。无监督方法利用未标注数据，近年来显示出有希望的发展，性能差距正在缩小。

Method: 采用双焦点综述方法：首先回顾和分类监督行人重识别的重要文献，然后探讨过去三年无监督行人重识别的最新进展。

Result: 监督方法在行人重识别领域已接近性能极限，改进空间有限；无监督方法显示出快速发展的趋势，性能正在向监督方法收敛。

Conclusion: 这篇综述捕捉了监督技术的成熟格局和无监督学习领域的潜在成果，为行人重识别领域的发展提供了全面视角。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

### [10] [Sequential Token Merging: Revisiting Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22691)
*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Sequential Token Merging (STM)方法，通过双向最近邻合并和隐藏状态保护来解决Vision Mambas的token冗余问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著减少计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mambas虽然具有次二次复杂度，但其效率仍受图像分辨率导致的二次token扩展限制。现有方法忽略了ViMs内在的有限方向序列依赖(LDSD)这一关键信息流机制。

Method: STM包含两个核心组件：1) 双向最近邻合并，通过对称空间聚合保持序列依赖；2) 隐藏状态保护，稳定类别token周围的隐藏状态。该方法利用Mamba的逐层损失收敛特性，将时间遗忘转化为稳定性。

Result: 实验显示STM的优越性：ViM-Ti在20% token减少时仅下降1.0%准确率，ViM-S在40%减少时仅下降1.4%。该方法以最小复杂度实现了最先进的效率。

Conclusion: STM不仅提供了解决Vision Mambas效率问题的新方法，还为状态空间模型动态提供了新的理论见解。

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

Conclusion: 这项工作将为该领域的研究人员提供有价值的资源和指导，并探讨了该领域中一些有价值但研究不足的开放性问题。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific
domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of this field. Here, we present an
in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single image
super-resolution (SISR), video super-resolution (VSR), stereo super-resolution
(SSR), and light field super-resolution (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150
SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will
serve as a valuable resource and offer guidance to researchers in this domain.
To facilitate access to related work, we created a dedicated repository

### [12] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP风格对比训练框架的视觉语言模型，用于高光谱图像场景理解，仅更新0.07%参数即可实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据需求增长，高效学习越来越依赖高质量数据的筛选和提炼。高光谱图像具有高维3D体素结构，其跨模态对齐问题尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用CLIP风格对比训练框架，将视觉主干网络的体素级嵌入映射到冻结大型嵌入模型的潜在空间，通过可训练探针对齐视觉特征与文本标记表示，使用硬负样本和半硬负样本进行对比学习，并引入描述性提示词增强对齐。

Result: 在Indian Pines数据集上比单模态和多模态基线方法OA提高+0.92，Kappa提高+1.60；在Pavia University数据集上OA提高+0.69，Kappa提高+0.90，参数量比DCTN少50倍，比SS-TMNet少90倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效的参数更新实现了高光谱图像场景理解的最先进性能，证明了在跨模态对齐中使用精心设计的对比学习策略的有效性。

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GPR-NIAM方法，通过注意力隔离和跨模态知识对齐实现单轮联邦提示学习，在保持跨任务泛化能力的同时解决数据异构性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法依赖多轮通信，而单轮联邦学习方法缺乏跨任务泛化能力，需要一种能在单轮通信中保持泛化性能的方法。

Method: 使用注意力隔离模块限制可学习提示与原始文本嵌入的过度交互，并通过跨模态协作精炼模块整合分散的视觉知识来校准全局提示。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上的实验表明，GPR-NIAM在类别级和领域级泛化方面优于8种最先进方法。

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM通过精心设计的注意力机制和跨模态知识对齐，实现了高效的单轮联邦提示学习，具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云语义分割中缺乏所有对象类别完整训练数据的问题，特别是在人机协作环境中，需要对未见过的对象类别进行识别。

Method: 将混合专家层集成到生成式零样本学习的生成器和判别器中，使用预训练的KPConv模型提取特征，生成与真实特征相似的假特征。

Conclusion: 结合生成式零样本学习和混合专家的GZSL-MoE模型为理解复杂3D环境提供了有前景的解决方案，特别是在缺乏完整训练数据的情况下。

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

*Adithya Giri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IBiT方法，通过引入学习掩码为Vision Transformers添加归纳偏置，使其能在小数据集上有效学习，无需知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在计算机视觉中占主导地位，但缺乏CNN的归纳偏置，需要大数据集学习这些偏置。

Method: 通过学习的掩码为Vision Transformers引入归纳偏置，构建IBiT模型。

Result: IBiT在小数据集上显著更准确，同时保持Transformer的可解释性。

Conclusion: 学习掩码能有效为Transformer添加归纳偏置，使其在小数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

*Zezhong Fan,Xiaohan Li,Luyi Ma,Kai Zhao,Liang Peng,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kaushiki Nag,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutAgent是一个结合视觉语言推理和组合扩散的智能框架，用于生成符合语义关系和物理合理性的多目标场景布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型缺乏显式空间推理能力，导致物体布局不真实；而传统机器人空间规划方法难以捕捉视觉场景的语义丰富性。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型预处理输入图像（分割、物体尺寸估计、场景图构建、提示重写），然后利用组合扩散方法合成符合场景图关系的边界框，最后通过前景条件图像生成器渲染完整场景。

Result: 实验表明LayoutAgent在布局一致性、空间真实性和美学对齐方面优于其他最先进的布局生成模型。

Conclusion: LayoutAgent成功弥合了视觉生成与空间规划之间的差距，实现了语义丰富且物理合理的场景布局生成。

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

TL;DR: CompareBench是一个评估视觉语言模型视觉比较推理能力的基准，包含1000个QA对，涵盖数量、时间、几何和空间四个任务，揭示了当前VLMs在视觉比较推理方面的系统性盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉比较推理是视觉语言模型的基本但未被充分研究的技能，需要建立专门的基准来评估和推动该能力的发展。

Method: 构建CompareBench基准，包含1000个QA对，分为数量(600)、时间(100)、几何(200)和空间(100)四个任务，基于自建的TallyBench和HistCaps辅助数据集。评估了闭源API和开源模型。

Result: 结果显示明显的扩展趋势，但最强模型在时间排序和空间关系上持续失败，在基础计数和几何比较中也常犯对人类来说简单的错误。

Conclusion: 视觉比较是当前VLMs的系统性盲点，CompareBench为推进更可靠的多模态推理奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

TL;DR: MILR是一种测试时方法，在统一的潜在向量空间中联合推理图像和文本，通过策略梯度方法在离散标记的向量表示中搜索，无需高质量推理数据进行微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于推理的图像生成方法要么局限于单一模态（图像或文本），要么依赖高质量推理数据进行微调，存在局限性。

Method: 在统一多模态理解和生成（MUG）框架中实例化MILR，通过策略梯度方法在离散图像和文本标记的向量表示中进行搜索，由图像质量评论家指导。

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和WISE基准测试中均达到最先进结果，在知识密集型WISE上总体得分0.63，比基线提高80%。

Conclusion: 统一潜在空间中的联合推理是MILR强大性能的关键，定性研究显示其在时间和文化推理方面具有显著能力。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

TL;DR: 提出了UESA-Net网络，通过多方向收缩注意力机制解决超声图像分割中全局语义与局部细节的语义鸿沟问题，在乳腺和甲状腺超声图像分割上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超声图像分割中存在的斑点噪声、结构重叠以及全局-局部特征交互弱的问题，弥合全局上下文与局部细节之间的语义鸿沟。

Method: 采用U型网络架构，在编码器中使用多方向（水平、垂直、深度）注意力模块提取空间细节，结合收缩策略整合先验知识和局部特征；解码器采用成对收缩机制，结合先验物理线索和编码器特征增强上下文建模。

Result: 在TN3K数据集上IoU达到0.8487，在BUSI数据集上IoU达到0.6495，均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: UESA-Net通过聚合多方向空间信息和先验知识，有效提升了乳腺和甲状腺超声分割的鲁棒性和准确性，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要依赖语义标签和全局图像表示，忽略了区分相近类别所需的详细部件级线索。

Method: 提出PartCo框架，利用部件级视觉特征对应关系来捕捉更细粒度的语义结构，从而更细致地理解类别关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，PartCo显著提升了当前GCD方法的性能，达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: PartCo通过弥合语义标签和部件级视觉组合之间的差距，为GCD设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new
benchmarks for GCD. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/partco

TL;DR: DEFT是一种高效的文本到图像模型微调框架，通过将权重矩阵更新分解为两个可训练矩阵：在低秩子空间补集上的投影和低秩更新，实现了在个性化、多任务统一和可编辑性之间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练文本到图像模型在高效微调中面临的挑战：在目标分布对齐（从有限图像学习新概念）、保持多任务指令能力以及维持可编辑性之间取得平衡。

Method: DEFT框架将预训练权重矩阵的更新分解为两个组件：1）在由低秩矩阵张成的低秩子空间补集上的投影；2）低秩更新。单个可训练低秩矩阵定义子空间，另一个可训练低秩矩阵在该子空间内实现灵活参数适应。

Result: 在Dreambooth、Dreambench Plus（个性化）、InsDet（对象和场景适应）和VisualCloze（视觉上下文学习的通用图像生成）数据集上进行了广泛实验，使用Stable Diffusion和统一模型，取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DEFT框架展示了高效微调的新兴特性，在保持计算效率和参数效率的同时，实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

Motivation: 现有视频评估方法局限于单一不透明分数，缺乏可解释性，无法全面评估视频质量的多方面特性（视觉质量、语义对齐、物理一致性）。

Method: 使用包含27,168个人工标注视频的大规模数据集VideoFeedback2，采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调后使用GRPO进行强化学习，增强分析鲁棒性。

Result: 在VideoScore-Bench-v2基准上达到44.35准确率（提升5.94），在四个外部基准上平均性能达50.37（提升4.32）。

Conclusion: VideoScore2提供了可解释的评估，通过有效的奖励建模为可控生成搭建桥梁，支持Best-of-N采样。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),

TL;DR: TRUST是一种针对状态空间模型（SSMs）的测试时适应方法，通过利用多种遍历排列生成输入图像的不同因果视角，使用模型预测作为伪标签来更新Mamba特定参数，提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型（SSMs）作为视觉Transformer的高效替代方案，在分布偏移下泛化性能显著下降，需要专门的方法来提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TRUST方法，利用多样化的遍历排列生成多个因果视角，使用模型预测作为伪标签指导Mamba特定参数的更新，并通过权重平均整合不同遍历扫描的学习信息。

Result: 在七个基准测试上的实验表明，TRUST能够持续提升鲁棒性，并优于现有的测试时适应方法。

Conclusion: TRUST是首个明确利用SSMs独特架构特性进行适应的方法，有效解决了SSMs在分布偏移下的泛化问题。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

Motivation: 视觉个性化在面向用户的AI系统中至关重要，但现有大型视觉语言模型在适应个体用户方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建包含10k图像-查询对的基准数据集，将个性化分为三种主要任务类型，使用23个广泛使用的VLM通过三阶段协议进行评估：概念注入、多轮对话和个性化查询。

Result: 大多数VLM在个性化方面表现不佳，特别是在保持对话一致性、处理用户偏好和适应视觉线索方面存在困难。

Conclusion: VLM个性化存在显著改进空间，MMPB通过识别这些局限性并为未来研究提供可扩展基准，为真正个性化的多模态AI奠定了基础。

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全可控的对抗性补丁生成框架，允许攻击者自由选择输入图像和目标类别，实现精确的错误分类控制。该方法结合生成式U-Net设计和Grad-CAM引导的补丁放置，在保持视觉真实性的同时最大化攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性补丁攻击方法大多依赖不切实际的白盒假设、非针对性目标或产生视觉上明显的补丁，限制了实际应用。需要开发一种既具有针对性控制能力，又保持视觉真实性的实用攻击框架。

Method: 使用生成式U-Net架构结合Grad-CAM引导的语义感知补丁放置策略，通过语义感知定位来最大化攻击效果，同时保持补丁的视觉真实性。

Result: 在卷积网络（DenseNet-121、ResNet-50）和视觉变换器（ViT-B/16、Swin-B/16等）上的广泛实验表明，该方法在所有设置下都达到了最先进的性能，攻击成功率（ASR）和目标类别成功率（TCS）均持续超过99%。

Conclusion: 该框架同时确保了真实性、针对性控制和黑盒适用性这三个最具挑战性的维度，为对抗性鲁棒性研究设立了新基准，弥合了理论攻击强度与实际隐蔽性之间的差距。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

Motivation: 传统的时间显著性检测后处理方法计算成本高，而现有的可解释模型往往在标准基准测试中性能不佳，需要在保持预测性能的同时提供更好的时间可解释性。

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their
bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic
range. However, obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based
vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present
ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize
high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text
labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the
diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model
performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based
on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based
generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

*Nikita Drozdov,Marat Zinovev,Dmitry Sorokin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR方法，首次将Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KANs）与隐式神经表示（INRs）结合用于可变形图像配准，通过随机基函数采样策略在保持配准质量的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习型方法需要大量训练数据且在某些器官类型和成像模态上难以达到经典迭代方法的精度，而现有INR方法存在实例特定优化、计算效率和种子依赖学习稳定性问题。

Method: 将KANs集成到基于INRs的可变形图像配准中，提出随机基函数采样策略减少所需基函数数量，开发了KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR两种模型。

Result: 在三个不同数据集（肺部CT、脑部MRI、心脏MRI）上评估，KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR在所有评估模态和解剖结构中实现了INR方法中最高的精度，计算开销最小且学习稳定性最佳。

Conclusion: RandKAN-IDIR模型在随机基函数采样下略微优于可学习基函数索引模型，同时消除了额外的训练时间复杂性，为医学图像配准提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了卷积集变换器（CST），一种直接处理3D图像张量的神经网络架构，能够同时进行特征提取和上下文建模，在集合分类和异常检测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集合输入网络（如Deep Sets和Set Transformer）只能处理向量输入，必须与CNN特征提取器级联，无法直接处理3D图像张量，限制了性能。

Method: CST直接在3D图像张量上操作，同时执行特征提取和上下文建模，支持Grad-CAM等CNN可解释性方法，并可进行预训练和迁移学习。

Result: 在集合分类和集合异常检测任务中表现优于现有方法，并发布了在ImageNet上预训练的CST-15骨干网络。

Conclusion: CST通过直接处理图像张量和同时进行特征提取与上下文建模，实现了更优的性能和更好的可解释性，支持预训练和迁移学习。

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and
surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal
features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections
from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,

detection head, (3) cascaded coordinate attention blocks, and (4) a branch
pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance
regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20
different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5
IoU by +7.9%, Precision by +3%, and Recall by +10.2%, while achieving up to 123
FPS on a single GPU. Cross-dataset validation on a fifth dataset further

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅的参数化表示难以作为特征被神经网络学习，因为高斯参数具有非唯一性和异构性，直接使用会导致模型高度依赖数据。

Method: 基于连续子流形场构建3D高斯泼溅的嵌入表示，封装高斯基元的本质信息，保持颜色和几何结构，同时确保唯一映射和通道同质性。

Result: 该方法为3D高斯泼溅提供了更适合神经网络学习的表示形式。

Conclusion: 提出的嵌入表示方法能够更好地支持3D高斯泼溅在神经网络中的学习过程。

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决一步生成器存在的两个关键限制：继承教师模型的建模偏差，以及离散令牌输出阻碍梯度流动，无法进行后蒸馏优化。

Method: 引入软嵌入作为连续代理，替换离散令牌，保持表示保真度的同时提供完全可微性，集成到Di[M]O蒸馏框架中形成Soft-Di[M]O。

Result: 在多个MDM教师模型上实现最先进的一步生成性能：ImageNet-256上FID达1.56，文本到图像任务上获得更高的GenEval和HPS分数，并通过TTEO获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: 软嵌入使一步生成器端到端可训练，支持多种优化技术，显著提升生成质量。

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

Conclusion: FishAI 2.0提高了海洋鱼类识别的效率和准确性，为海洋生态监测和保护提供了可扩展的技术解决方案，具有科学价值和实际应用性。

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

Conclusion: ARSS框架成功地将自回归模型应用于新颖视图生成任务，在保持因果结构的同时实现了高质量的视图合成，为世界建模任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

Motivation: 动作识别模型过度依赖静态线索而非人体动态运动，这种静态偏差导致在现实应用和零样本动作识别中性能不佳。

Method: 使用统计独立性损失在偏置和无偏置流之间，结合场景预测损失，分离时间动态信息与静态场景信息。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效减少静态偏差，并确认了场景预测损失的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过分离动态和静态信息的方法能够有效缓解动作识别中的静态偏差问题。

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating

### [41] [Planning with Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23014)
*Yihao Sun,Zhilong Zhang,Yang Yu,Pierre-Luc Bacon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-Plan是一个基于统一多模态模型（UMMs）的规划框架，通过生成视觉内容进行推理，在长时程规划任务中显著提高了成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖基于语言的推理，限制了决策能力。统一多模态模型支持多模态输入输出，具有通过生成视觉内容进行推理的更大潜力。

Method: 在Uni-Plan框架中，单一模型同时作为策略、动态模型和价值函数。提出自判别过滤方法，让生成模型作为自判别器过滤无效的动态预测以避免幻觉。

Result: 在长时程规划任务中，Uni-Plan相比基于VLM的方法显著提高了成功率，并展现出强大的数据可扩展性，无需专家演示且在相同训练数据规模下获得更好性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来使用UMMs进行推理和决策的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

*Xiafeng Man,Zhipeng Wei,Jingjing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出D-Plus-Minus (DPM)框架，基于差分隐私理论检测文本到图像扩散模型的版权侵权，无需原始训练数据或文本提示即可可靠识别侵权内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉模型（如Stable Diffusion）可能未经授权记忆和复制受版权保护内容，现有检测方法缺乏鲁棒性和理论支撑。

Method: 从差分隐私角度形式化版权侵权概念，提出条件敏感度指标；通过微调模型在学习和遗忘两个方向模拟数据包含/排除过程；使用统计指标在正交提示分布上计算置信度分数。

Result: DPM可靠检测侵权内容，无需访问原始训练数据集或文本提示，为生成AI时代的知识产权保护提供可解释的实用解决方案。

Conclusion: DPM框架为扩散模型版权侵权检测提供了理论基础和有效方法，构建的CIDD数据集为标准化基准测试提供了资源。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了感知影响力概念，系统评估了感知损失在低剂量CT图像去噪中的设计选择，发现文献中广泛使用的配置表现不佳，并提供了基于统计分析的客观设计指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 感知损失在低剂量CT图像增强中作为像素级损失的替代方案，但损失设计中的关键决策（如特征表示级别、预训练数据集、权重分配）尚未充分探索，需要系统评估这些选择对模型性能的影响。

Method: 引入感知影响力指标量化感知损失对总损失的相对贡献，提出原则性框架系统评估损失设计选择的影响，通过系统实验比较不同配置的性能。

Result: 研究表明文献中广泛使用的感知损失配置表现不如优化设计的替代方案，更好的感知损失设计能显著改善重建CT图像的去噪效果和结构保真度，且无需改变网络架构。

Conclusion: 提供了基于统计分析的客观指南，指导感知损失在低剂量CT去噪中的有效使用，证明了精心设计的感知损失能显著提升图像质量。

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级多模态预训练变换器方法，用于洪水淹没制图，能够灵活使用SAR、多光谱或两者结合的传感器数据，在参数效率上显著优于大型基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水灾害频发造成巨大损失，现有遥感技术面临天气依赖、重访周期限制、计算资源需求大等问题，需要快速响应且不受传感器可用性约束的解决方案。

Method: 通过微调Presto轻量级多模态预训练变换器（约0.4M参数），处理SAR和多光谱数据的像素级信息，支持单一传感器或融合输入的洪水检测。

Result: 在Sen1Floods11数据集上评估，传感器融合场景下F1得分0.896、mIoU 0.886，优于Prithvi-100M基准；多光谱单独场景F1 0.893，SAR单独场景F1 0.718。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了参数高效、传感器灵活的解决方案，能够在实际灾害场景中实现快速洪水范围评估，不受传感器可用性限制。

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

*Jingxing Li,Yongjae Lee,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeLoc3r通过几何一致性正则化(GCR)增强相对相机位姿回归方法，在保持ReLoc3R快速推理速度的同时，接近MASt3R的高精度水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ReLoc3R内部表示的几何不一致性问题，克服回归方法速度与精度之间的权衡困境。

Method: 使用几何一致性正则化(GCR)，在训练时利用真实深度生成密集3D-2D对应关系，通过FusionTransformer学习对应关系重要性，使用加权RANSAC计算几何一致位姿，创建一致性损失将几何知识转移到回归网络中。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中显著优于ReLoc3R：CO3Dv2数据集AUC@5°从34.85%提升至40.45%(相对改进16%)，RealEstate10K从66.70%提升至68.66%，MegaDepth1500从49.60%提升至50.45%。

Conclusion: GeLoc3r通过在训练中教授几何一致性而非在推理时强制执行，实现了神经网络学习相机几何的范式转变，兼具回归方法的速度和对应方法的几何理解能力。

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

TL;DR: 提出基于激活匹配的方法，为预训练分类器在任意图像上的决策生成最小化、忠实解释。通过训练轻量自编码器输出二值掩码，保持模型预测和中间激活，结合多目标优化得到紧凑可解释的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要为预训练分类器的决策提供忠实且最小化的解释，既能保持模型行为又能去除不相关区域，提高可解释性。

Method: 训练轻量自编码器生成二值掩码，结合多目标优化：多层激活匹配（KL散度+交叉熵）、掩码先验（L1面积+二值化惩罚+总变差）和溯因约束，确保解释的忠实性和必要性。

Result: 生成的小型、可解释掩码能够保持分类器行为，同时去除不相关输入区域，提供实用且忠实的简约解释。

Conclusion: 该方法通过激活匹配和多目标优化，成功生成了忠实、最小化的解释，提升了模型决策的可解释性。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

Conclusion: 可控的文本驱动掩码能够实现语义对齐的自监督学习，推动医学图像分析中鲁棒视觉模型的发展。

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

Conclusion: FMC-DETR通过频率解耦融合有效解决了航拍图像中小目标检测的挑战，在保持细节的同时增强全局上下文感知

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

TL;DR: 该论文研究图像修复中的偏好对齐问题，通过直接偏好优化方法构建偏好训练数据集，发现大多数奖励模型能提供有效奖励分数，偏好数据在不同模型和基准上表现出稳健趋势，但奖励模型存在可观察的偏见，简单集成可缓解这些偏见。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化方法进行对齐训练，利用公共奖励模型构建偏好训练数据集。在九个奖励模型、两个基准和两个具有不同结构和生成算法的基线模型上进行实验。

Result: 大多数奖励模型能提供有效的奖励分数来构建偏好数据；偏好数据在不同模型和基准上表现出稳健趋势；奖励模型存在可观察的偏见（亮度、构图和色彩方案），容易导致奖励破解；简单集成这些模型可通过缓解偏见产生稳健和可泛化的结果。

Conclusion: 基于这些观察，对齐模型在标准指标、GPT-4评估和人类评估方面显著优于先前模型，无需改变模型结构或使用新数据集。这项工作为这个有前景的领域设定了简单而坚实的基线。

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is

Motivation: 现有基础模型在计算病理学中参数庞大、处理高倍数图像计算成本高，难以在临床环境中部署。

Method: 采用跨放大倍数蒸馏框架，包含双级知识转移（全局图像表示和局部空间token映射对齐），使用紧凑主干网络完全在5x放大倍数下运行。

Result: 在6个临床相关组织病理学分析任务中，诊断准确率仅比大模型低1%，处理速度达到每分钟8.8张全切片图像，比现有方法快30倍。

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch是一个零样本参考图像分割框架，通过利用模型内部组件增强文本和图像的空间表示，无需额外训练即可显著提升空间定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在图像文本对齐方面表现出色，但在理解空间关系方面存在困难。文本流中现有方法主要关注主名词短语，忽略了上下文标记；视觉流中CLIP对具有不同空间布局的图像生成相似特征，对空间结构敏感性有限。

Method: CoPatch框架在语言方面构建混合文本特征，整合携带空间线索的上下文标记；在视觉方面从中间层提取补丁级图像特征，这些层能更好地保留空间结构。增强的特征融合到聚类图像-文本相似度图CoMap中，实现精确的掩码选择。

Result: CoPatch在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+、RefCOCOg和PhraseCut数据集上的零样本参考图像分割任务中显著提升了空间定位能力（mIoU提高2-7个点）。

Conclusion: 研究强调了恢复和利用视觉语言模型中固有的未开发空间知识的重要性，为零样本参考图像分割开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore
the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge
inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in
zero-shot RIS.

*Emadeldeen Hamdan,Ahmet Enis Cetin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTMA-Net结合哈达玛变换和免乘法SRAM内存计算，在保持精度的同时显著减少神经网络中的乘法运算量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低乘法运算成本对边缘设备部署深度神经网络至关重要，特别是在能耗受限的环境中

Method: 选择性地用混合哈达玛变换层替换中间卷积层，通过免乘法内存操作实现内部卷积

Result: 相比基线ResNet模型，HTMA-Net消除了高达52%的乘法运算，在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny ImageNet上保持可比精度，同时显著降低计算复杂度和参数数量

Conclusion: 将结构化哈达玛变换层与SRAM内存计算免乘法算子结合是实现高效深度学习架构的有前途路径

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了ChangeIMTI数据集和ChangeVG模型，用于遥感图像变化理解的多任务学习，在变化描述、分类、计数和定位任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感变化理解数据集缺乏深度理解和多任务交互，无法满足变化描述、计数和定位等多样化任务需求。

Method: 构建ChangeIMTI多任务指令数据集，设计ChangeVG视觉引导视觉语言模型，采用双分支架构结合细粒度空间特征提取和高级语义总结。

Result: 在变化描述任务上，方法比最强基线Semantic-CC在S*m指标上提升1.39分，综合评估表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的ChangeIMTI数据集和ChangeVG模型有效解决了遥感变化理解的多任务挑战，通过视觉引导机制实现了层次化跨模态学习。

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

*Chenrui Ma,Xi Xiao,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yanning Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件依赖耦合策略的统一多阶段生成框架，通过多阶段插值轨迹分解生成过程，在确保准确分布学习的同时实现端到端优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在计算成本与保真度之间存在权衡问题：基于VAE的模型存在信息丢失、细节有限且无法端到端训练；像素空间模型计算成本过高；级联模型虽然降低计算成本但阶段分离阻碍端到端优化和知识共享。

Method: 使用条件依赖耦合策略构建统一多阶段生成框架，将生成过程分解为多阶段插值轨迹，整个过程建模为单一统一的扩散变换器，消除分离模块需求并支持知识共享。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多个分辨率下同时实现了高保真度和高效率。

Conclusion: 所提出的统一多阶段生成框架有效解决了现有模型在计算与保真度之间的权衡问题，实现了准确分布学习和端到端优化的平衡。

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

Result: 为这些任务建立了强大的基准，证明了先进自监督模型在改进NCCT自动卒中诊断方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了自监督模型在卒中诊断中的潜力，同时提供了对该方法优势和当前限制的清晰分析。

Abstract: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is essential for rapid stroke
diagnosis but is limited by low image contrast and signal to noise ratio. We
address this challenge by leveraging DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised
vision transformer, to generate powerful feature representations for a
comprehensive set of stroke analysis tasks. Our evaluation encompasses infarct
and hemorrhage segmentation, anomaly classification (normal vs. stroke and
normal vs. infarct vs. hemorrhage), hemorrhage subtype classification (EDH,
SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH), and dichotomized ASPECTS classification (<=6 vs. >6) on
multiple public and private datasets. This study establishes strong benchmarks
for these tasks and demonstrates the potential of advanced self-supervised
models to improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT, providing a clear
analysis of both the advantages and current constraints of the approach. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在处理需要多步骤推理和领域特定工具的复杂EO任务时能力不足，现有基于智能体的方法局限于RGB感知、浅层推理且缺乏系统评估协议。

Method: 构建基于MCP的工具生态系统，动态调用跨模态的专家工具和模型，支持地球物理参数检索和定量时空分析等复杂科学任务。

Result: 开发了Earth-Bench基准测试，包含248个专家策划任务和13,729张图像，涵盖光谱、产品和RGB模态，采用双级评估协议评估推理轨迹和最终结果。实验验证了Earth-Agent的有效性和潜力。

Conclusion: Earth-Agent为EO分析建立了新范式，推动该领域向科学基础的下一代LLMs应用发展。代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth
observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

TL;DR: WeatherCycle是一个统一的非配对框架，通过双向退化-内容转换循环解决多天气条件下的图像修复问题，使用亮度-色度分解策略分离退化与内容，并结合退化感知课程正则化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖特定任务的物理先验，其狭窄焦点限制了在多样化真实天气场景中的可扩展性和泛化能力，因此需要开发一个统一的非配对框架来处理多天气条件下的图像修复。

Method: 采用亮度-色度分解策略解耦退化与内容；提出亮度退化引导模块(LDGM)从退化图像池学习亮度退化先验并通过频域幅度调制注入干净图像；引入难度感知对比正则化(DACR)模块通过CLIP分类器识别困难样本并增强语义一致性。

Result: 在多个多天气数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在无监督方法中达到了最先进的性能，对复杂天气退化具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: WeatherCycle通过统一的非配对框架成功解决了多天气条件下的图像修复问题，展示了在多样化真实天气场景中的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

TL;DR: Sparse2Dense是一个基于关键点的生成框架，使用稀疏3D关键点作为传输符号，实现超低码率人体视频压缩和精确顶点预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决带宽受限多媒体应用中，同时实现超低码率人体视频压缩和准确顶点预测的挑战，需要协调动态运动建模、细节外观合成和几何一致性。

Method: 提出多任务学习和关键点感知的深度生成模型，通过紧凑3D关键点编码复杂人体运动，并利用这些稀疏关键点估计密集运动以实现时间一致性和真实纹理的视频合成，同时集成顶点预测器学习人体顶点几何。

Result: 实验表明Sparse2Dense在人体视频压缩方面优于传统/生成式视频编解码器，同时能够为下游几何应用提供精确的人体顶点预测。

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense有望促进带宽高效的人体中心媒体传输，如实时运动分析、虚拟人体动画和沉浸式娱乐。

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向可扩展AI驱动车轴计数系统的重要一步，为机器视觉替代传统路边基础设施铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside
infrastructure.

*Behraj Khan,Tahir Qasim Syed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM是一个轻量级适配框架，通过特征Fisher信息惩罚和置信度错位惩罚来改进SAM模型在医学图像分割中的领域泛化能力和校准性能，仅微调掩码解码器而冻结编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型在自然图像上表现出强大的零样本性能，但在应用于医学体积数据时存在领域偏移和过度自信的问题。

Method: 提出CalSAM框架：(i)通过3D特征图上的特征Fisher信息惩罚降低编码器对领域偏移的敏感性；(ii)通过置信度错位惩罚惩罚过度自信的体素级误差。结合损失函数仅微调掩码解码器，保持SAM编码器冻结。

Result: 在跨中心和扫描仪偏移评估中，CalSAM显著提高了准确性和校准性能：在BraTS扫描仪分割（西门子→GE）上，DSC相对提升7.4%，HD95减少26.9%，ECE减少39.5%；在ATLAS-C（运动伪影）上，DSC相对提升5.3%，ECE减少32.6%。

Conclusion: CalSAM为脑MRI分割提供了改进的领域泛化能力和更好的校准不确定性估计，同时保留了冻结SAM编码器的计算优势。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督在线3D实例分割方法（如UNIT）存在训练多样性有限、时间采样僵化、过度依赖噪声伪标签等问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 通过合成点云序列生成增强训练分布，采用灵活采样策略结合相邻和非相邻帧，使用动态加权损失强调置信样本。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI、nuScenes和PandaSet数据集上持续超越UNIT和其他无监督基线方法，获得更高的分割精度和更鲁棒的时间关联。

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强训练多样性、灵活时间采样和动态损失加权，显著提升了无监督在线3D实例分割的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了人脸识别系统的实际严重漏洞，证明即使对目标系统了解有限，也能构建鲁棒且可转移的对抗攻击

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

Motivation: 现有Sparse Model Inversion (SMI)方法在ViT模型反转中过早丢弃看似不重要的patch，但研究发现这些patch实际上能够通过持续反转获得可转移知识，因此需要更高效的策略来平衡效率和知识提取。

Method: 提出PRI方法，在反转过程中逐步分离最重要的patch构建稀疏合成图像，同时允许剩余patch继续演化以积累更多类别相关知识，实现Re-Birth效应。

Result: PRI比标准Dense Model Inversion快10倍，比SMI快2倍，在准确率上持续优于SMI并匹配DMI性能。

Conclusion: PRI通过渐进式patch分离策略有效平衡了计算效率和知识转移性能，证明了所有patch都有潜力获得可转移知识，不应过早丢弃。

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用模型自身长回答与短答案之间一致性来生成偏好对进行训练的新框架，通过短二元问题的可靠回答来评估和排序生成内容，无需人工标注或外部监督即可减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型经常产生幻觉细节，生成不存在对象或不准确属性，影响输出可靠性。现有方法依赖大量人工标注或更强大模型的外部监督。

Method: 设计了自反思流程，将详细模型回答与简洁二元答案进行比较，利用不一致信号自动筛选高质量训练数据，仅依赖自一致性而非外部监督。

Result: 在AMBER、MultiObject-Hal、Object HalBench和MMHal-Bench等多个基准测试中显示出事实基础和可靠性的显著提升，同时在LLaVA-Bench和MMBench上保持强大的指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，仅使用未标记数据就能有效减少幻觉，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

Motivation: 传统时尚搭配推荐方法需要昂贵的大规模标注数据和任务特定训练，且缺乏显式的人类美学指导。在MLLM时代，可以简化为无需训练的方法，获得更好的推荐分数和美学感知能力。

Method: 使用MLLM生成目标物品描述，通过美学链式思维将图像提炼为结构化美学档案（颜色、风格、场合、季节、材料、平衡），通过动态熵门控机制融合视觉摘要、文本描述和美学向量，在共享嵌入空间中对候选物品进行排序。

Conclusion: TATTOO展示了在MLLM时代，传统基于训练的推荐流程可以简化为无需训练的范式，获得更好的推荐效果和美学感知能力。

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

Motivation: 热成像在ADAS中具有优势，但研究面临数据集有限和模拟器支持不足的挑战。现有RGB到热成像转换方法只关注一对一映射。

Method: 使用多模态转换框架，提出组件感知自适应实例归一化(CoAdaIN)，对不同图像组件分别应用风格，而非全局应用。

Result: 该方法生成了更真实和多样化的热成像图像转换结果。

Conclusion: CoAdaIN方法在RGB到热成像图像转换中实现了更优的一对多映射效果，为ADAS系统提供了更好的热成像数据支持。

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper
published in IEEE Sensors Conference 2024. The final published version is

Motivation: 人类活动识别在医疗保健、制造和人机交互中有重要应用。LiDAR点云提供隐私保护且对光照变化鲁棒，但需要有效的特征提取方法。

Method: 将每个LiDAR帧映射为邻近图（ε-图），计算拉普拉斯谱，使用特征值和特征向量统计形成姿态描述符，通过滑动窗口计算时间统计量，最后用支持向量机和随机森林分类。

Result: 在MM-Fi数据集（40个受试者，27种活动）上，采用严格的主体独立协议，在13类康复活动上达到94.4%准确率，所有27种活动上达到90.3%准确率，超越了基于骨架的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种从点云几何直接导出的紧凑且可解释的特征集，为端到端深度学习提供了准确高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

Motivation: 稀疏视图新视角合成存在严重的几何模糊问题，现有方法在几何保真度和场景完整性之间存在权衡：回归模型几何忠实但不完整，生成模型能完成场景但常引入结构不一致。

Method: 使用预训练的3D感知扩散模型合成新视图来提议完整场景，然后利用多视图立体模型作为3D感知预言机验证生成视图的3D不确定性，通过不确定性加权损失指导3D高斯溅射模型优化。

Conclusion: OracleGS成功地将强大的生成先验条件化于多视图几何证据，实现了生成完整性与回归保真度的调和。

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Motivation: 图像到视频生成模型的快速发展带来了安全风险，可能被用于创建欺骗性或恶意内容。现有防御方法如I2VGuard试图免疫图像，但有效阻止运动的方法仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出Vid-Freeze方法，这是一种新颖的注意力抑制对抗攻击，通过向图像添加精心设计的对抗扰动，明确针对I2V模型的注意力机制，完全破坏运动合成同时保持输入图像的语义保真度。

Result: 实验证明该方法提供了显著的保护效果，生成的免疫图像产生静止或接近静态的视频，有效阻止恶意内容创建。

Conclusion: 注意力攻击是防止I2V生成模型被滥用的一个前景广阔的方向，为构建稳健和主动的防御提供了重要思路。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

Conclusion: Diff-SPK成功利用生成先验补充低光条件下的纹理信息，为脉冲相机重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

Conclusion: BDGF框架有效解决了多模态DDPM中的模态不平衡问题，并通过扩散特征引导的多分支网络实现了更好的土地覆盖分类效果。

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

Motivation: 揭示VLMs在文化理解方面的局限性，它们看似文化胜任但实际上只是进行表面模式匹配，缺乏真正的文化认知能力。

Method: 引入诊断框架，通过分类和解释分析来探测VLMs对火主题文化图像的理解，测试模型在西方节日、非西方传统和紧急场景上的表现。

Result: 发现系统性偏见：模型能正确识别突出的西方节日，但在代表性不足的文化事件上表现不佳，经常给出模糊标签或危险地将紧急情况误分类为庆祝活动。

Conclusion: 这些失败暴露了符号捷径的风险，强调需要超越准确性指标的文化评估，以确保可解释和公平的多模态系统。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded

Conclusion: S2BNet成功将二值神经网络应用于全色锐化任务，在保持高效率的同时解决了二值化带来的关键问题。

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

*Hongrui Jia,Chaoya Jiang,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的解耦视觉推理框架，将推理与感知分离，使用LLM主导推理过程，LMM作为视觉问答引擎，有效减少视觉无根据的推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在扩展推理链时过度依赖文本逻辑，逐渐脱离视觉信息，导致推理路径偏离图像内容而产生错误结论。

Method: 采用无需训练的解耦方法：强大的LLM负责高层推理策略，通过询问LMM来提取所需视觉信息；LMM仅作为视觉问答引擎提供感知细节。

Result: 综合评估表明该框架能有效控制视觉推理过程，显著减少视觉无根据的推理步骤，大幅提升推理保真度。

Conclusion: 这种轻量级即插即用方法无需额外训练或架构修改，成功解决了LMMs在长推理链中视觉信息丢失的问题。

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP)框架，通过类别特定的正负提示词解耦语义，并引入渐进置信度解耦策略来抑制假阳性，解决了多标签类增量学习中的语义混淆和部分标注问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示词的方法在单标签类增量学习中表现良好，但在多标签类增量学习中表现不佳，主要面临两个内在挑战：共现类别导致的语义混淆和部分标注引起的真阴性-假阳性混淆。

Method: DDP框架包含两个核心组件：类别特定的正负提示词用于解耦语义，以及渐进置信度解耦(PCD)策略来抑制假阳性。采用冻结历史提示词作为知识锚点，并通过层间提示提高效率。

Result: 在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上，DDP持续优于现有方法，是首个在标准MS-COCO B40-C10基准下超过80% mAP和70% F1的无回放多标签类增量学习方法。

Conclusion: DDP框架有效解决了多标签类增量学习中的关键挑战，在保持参数效率的同时实现了最先进的性能，为无回放多标签类增量学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10
benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出LRPO框架，首次将在线强化学习应用于盲人脸恢复任务，通过似然正则化策略优化解决传统方法中的细节缺失和身份模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲人脸恢复面临大解空间探索的固有挑战，导致恢复图像出现细节缺失和身份模糊等常见伪影。

Method: 采用LRPO框架，包含三个关键策略：1)面向人脸恢复评估的复合奖励函数；2)地面真值引导的似然正则化；3)噪声级优势分配。

Result: 大量实验表明，LRPO显著提高了人脸恢复质量，在基线方法基础上取得明显改进，并达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LRPO框架成功解决了RL直接应用于BFR时的不兼容问题，在感知质量和保真度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 使用包含110,447张图像和246万视觉问答对的双语大规模数据集开发DentVLM模型，能够解读7种2D口腔成像模式。

Result: DentVLM在口腔疾病诊断准确率上比领先模型高19.6%，在错颌畸形诊断上高27.9%。临床研究中，在36个任务中的21个任务上超过13名初级牙医，在12个任务上超过12名资深牙医，并能将诊断时间减少15-22%。

Conclusion: DentVLM是一个强大的临床决策支持工具，能够提升初级口腔护理质量，缓解医患资源不平衡，并在牙科领域普及专业医疗知识。

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary
dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to
specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic-TreeRPO方法，通过树状结构搜索和动态噪声强度优化文本到图像生成，结合LayerTuning-RL范式，在语义一致性、视觉保真度和人类偏好对齐方面显著优于现有方法，同时提高训练效率50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习在文本到图像生成中虽然提升了生成质量，但存在探索效率低和采样策略不足的问题，需要更有效的探索方法和计算效率优化。

Method: 采用滑动窗口采样策略构建树状结构搜索，结合GRPO引导优化和约束SDE采样，共享前缀路径减少计算开销，并通过LayerTuning-RL范式将SFT重构为动态加权的进度奖励模型。

Result: 在HPS-v2.1、PickScore和ImageReward基准测试中分别比现有最优方法提升4.9%、5.91%和8.66%，训练效率提高近50%。

Conclusion: Dynamic-TreeRPO和LayerTuning-RL范式通过树状结构采样和动态探索策略，有效提升了文本到图像生成的多样性和质量，同时显著提高了训练效率。

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

TL;DR: 提出一种测试时不确定性估计框架，无需修改预训练配准网络架构，通过分析空间扰动下网络预测的方差来评估配准可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度配准网络缺乏预测可靠性指示，传统不确定性估计方法需要架构修改或重新训练，限制了在预训练网络中的应用。

Method: 基于配准的变换等变性原理，通过空间扰动输入图像，分析网络预测的方差，将不确定性分解为内在扩散和偏差抖动两个分量。

Result: 在四个解剖结构（脑、心脏、腹部、肺）和多个配准模型上验证，不确定性图与配准误差一致相关，能识别需要谨慎处理的区域。

Conclusion: 该框架可将任何预训练配准网络转变为风险感知工具，推进医学图像配准在临床和大规模研究环境中的安全部署。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在处理与训练分布不同的查询时表现不佳，现有基于LLM的查询重写方法缺乏监督信号，无法生成最优的重写结果。

Method: 提出GRAPE方法，使用GRPO将排序信号融入检索引导的查询重写，并设计语料相对排序奖励来解决分数膨胀问题。

Result: 在多种分布偏移场景下（多语言、长度、多模态）显著提升检索性能，Recall@10平均提升4.9%。

Conclusion: GRAPE能有效解决CLIP模型在分布偏移下的检索问题，通过排序感知的查询重写提升性能。

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中采集的点云通常因传感器分辨率限制、单一视角、遮挡和噪声等因素而不完整，这给各种应用带来挑战，因此需要有效的点云补全方法。

Method: 使用级联网络将补全任务分解为两个协同阶段：形状重建阶段生成辅助信息，融合补全阶段利用这些信息和知识蒸馏生成最终输出。通过知识蒸馏，教师模型将不完整-完整关联知识传递给学生模型。

Result: 在ShapeNet-55数据集的不同难度设置下，CasPoinTr在形状恢复和细节保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 级联结构和蒸馏策略有效增强了模型捕获全局形状上下文和细化局部细节的能力，成功弥合了不完整输入和完整目标之间的差距。

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

Motivation: 解决3D人体姿态估计需要大量人工标注3D关键点的问题，利用易获取的RGB-D序列和现有2D姿态标注数据，避免多视角相机标定和合成到真实数据迁移的问题。

Method: 使用现成2D姿态估计作为点云网络的弱监督，结合时空约束（身体对称性和关节运动），通过2D到3D反投影损失和跨模态交互增强学习过程，采用锚点到关节预测方法进行3D提升。

Result: 在CMU Panoptic和ITOP数据集上达到与全监督方法相当的性能，结合大规模无标签数据（如NTU RGB+D 60）在挑战性条件下性能进一步提升，3D提升方法达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: UniPose通过跨模态弱监督学习有效解决了3D人体姿态估计的标注瓶颈，展示了在实际应用中的潜力，为3D姿态估计提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

*Yuyang Sun,Junchuan Yu,Cuiming Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的Fracture-YOLO模型，通过集成CRSelector注意力机制和ScA模块来提升骨折检测性能，在mAP指标上显著超越基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统骨折诊断依赖医生经验，速度和准确性受限。AI技术特别是YOLO框架在骨折检测中显示出提升诊断效率和准确性的潜力。

Method: 开发了Fracture-YOLO模型，包含Critical-Region-Selector Attention(CRSelector)模块和Scale-Aware(ScA)头部。CRSelector利用全局纹理信息聚焦骨折区域关键特征，ScA模块动态调整不同尺度特征的权重。

Result: 实验结果显示，相比基线模型，Fracture-YOLO在检测精度上有显著提升，mAP50和mAP50-95分别提高了4和3个点，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Abstract: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis,
traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced
physicians, however the speed and accuracy of this approach are constrained by
the expertise. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, deep
learning models based on the YOLO framework have been widely employed for
fracture detection, demonstrating significant potential in improving diagnostic
efficiency and accuracy. This study proposes an improved YOLO-based model,
termed Fracture-YOLO, which integrates novel Critical-Region-Selector Attention
(CRSelector) and Scale-Aware (ScA) heads to further enhance detection
performance. Specifically, the CRSelector module utilizes global texture
information to focus on critical features of fracture regions. Meanwhile, the
ScA module dynamically adjusts the weights of features at different scales,
enhancing the model's capacity to identify fracture targets at multiple scales.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline model,
Fracture-YOLO achieves a significant improvement in detection precision, with
mAP50 and mAP50-95 increasing by 4 and 3, surpassing the baseline model and
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FracDetNet骨折检测框架，集成双焦点注意力和多尺度校准机制，在公开数据集上实现SOTA性能，mAP50-95达40.0%，比基线提升7.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中现有方法难以检测细微和形态多样骨折的问题，因成像角度多变和图像质量不佳导致检测困难。

Method: 集成双焦点注意力(DFA)模块，通过全局和局部注意力机制捕捉细节局部特征和全局上下文；多尺度校准(MC)自适应优化特征表示。

Result: 在GRAZPEDWRI-DX数据集上，mAP50-95达40.0%(提升7.5%)，mAP50达63.9%(提升4.2%)，骨折检测精度提升2.9%。

Conclusion: FracDetNet通过DFA和MC机制有效提升骨折检测性能，在挑战性医学影像任务中展现优越表现。

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is
proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture
detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical
practice. Despite recent advancements, existing methods still struggle with
detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging
angles and suboptimal image quality. To overcome these limitations, FracDetNet
integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC).
Specifically, the DFA module effectively captures detailed local features and
comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention
mechanisms. Additionally, the MC adaptively refines feature representations to
enhance detection performance. Experimental evaluations on the publicly
available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
FracDetNet achieving a mAP$_{50-95}$ of 40.0\%, reflecting a \textbf{7.5\%}
improvement over the baseline model. Furthermore, the mAP$_{50}$ reaches
63.9\%, representing an increase of \textbf{4.2\%}, with fracture-specific
detection accuracy also enhanced by \textbf{2.9\%}.

*Sahithya Ravi,Aditya Chinchure,Raymond T. Ng,Leonid Sigal,Vered Shwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPIKE是一个推理时框架，通过量化贝叶斯惊喜来识别视频中的关键时刻，SPIKE-RL通过强化学习优化信念假设，实现基于惊喜的帧采样策略，在多个下游基准测试中优于均匀采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频通常包含常规活动和令人难忘的惊喜事件，但大多数视频大语言模型通过均匀采样帧处理视频，可能错过定义视频叙事的关键时刻。

Method: SPIKE量化贝叶斯惊喜作为视频流中新视觉证据触发的信念更新，识别新视觉证据与先前信念冲突的时刻。SPIKE-RL利用GRPO基于视频字幕的奖励信号优化信念假设。

Result: SPIKE能有效定位视频中的惊喜时刻，与人类在正面（FunQA）和负面（Oops!）惊喜基准上高度相关。基于惊喜加权的帧采样策略在五个下游基准测试中相比均匀采样获得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过使视频大语言模型能够跟踪信念并注册惊喜，这项工作为更强大的模型铺平了道路，这些模型可以根据新信息修正其理解。

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

*Mohammed Alsakabi,Wael Mobeirek,John M. Dolan,Ozan K. Tonguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FM-SIREN和FM-FINER方法，通过为周期性激活函数分配神经元特定的频率乘数来解决现有INR网络中的隐藏特征冗余问题，显著提升信号重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于周期性激活的隐式神经表示网络（如SIREN和FINER）存在隐藏特征冗余问题，由于使用固定频率乘数，同一层内的神经元捕获重叠的频率分量，限制了多层感知机的表达能力。

Method: 受离散正弦变换等经典信号处理方法启发，为周期性激活函数分配基于奈奎斯特频率的神经元特定频率乘数，在不增加网络深度或超参数调优的情况下引入频率多样性。

Result: 该方法将特征冗余减少近50%，在1D音频、2D图像、3D形状拟合以及神经辐射场合成等多种INR任务中，信号重建性能持续优于基线方法，同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 通过简单而原则性的修改，提出的FM-SIREN和FM-FINER有效解决了周期性激活INR网络中的特征冗余问题，显著提升了表达能力和重建性能。

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

### [96] [FoR-SALE: Frame of Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23452)
*Tanawan Premsri,Parisa Kordjamshidi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoR-SALE是一个基于LLM的扩散编辑框架，通过引入参考坐标系来改进文本到图像生成中的空间理解能力，在空间描述与相机视角不一致时进行图像修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理非相机视角的空间描述时表现不佳，需要整合人类空间推理中的参考坐标系概念来提升空间理解能力。

Method: 扩展SLD框架，使用视觉模块提取图像空间配置，将空间表达式映射到相机视角，检测语言与视觉的对齐情况，并通过潜在空间操作调整生成图像的朝向和深度。

Result: 在两个专门评估FoR空间理解的基准测试中，将最先进T2I模型的性能提升了最高5.3%，仅需单轮修正。

Conclusion: FoR-SALE成功将参考坐标系整合到多模态语言模型中，显著提升了文本到图像生成的空间理解能力，证明了该框架的有效性。

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

*Tharindu Ekanayake,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPCNet是一个紧凑的、与估计器无关的模块，可将单目3D姿态估计器产生的相机中心骨架转换为身体中心的规范坐标系，消除视角依赖性，实现一致的姿态分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D姿态估计器产生相机中心的骨架，创建视角依赖的运动信号，这使健康监测和运动科学等应用中的比较分析变得复杂。

Method: 提出3DPCNet模块，使用混合编码器融合图卷积网络的局部骨骼特征和transformer的全局上下文，通过门控交叉注意力机制预测连续的6D旋转，映射到SO(3)矩阵来对齐姿态。模型在MM-Fi数据集上以自监督方式训练，使用合成旋转的姿态。

Result: 在MM-Fi基准测试中，3DPCNet将平均旋转误差从超过20°降低到3.4°，平均每关节位置误差从约64mm降低到47mm。在TotalCapture数据集上的定性评估显示，从视频中产生的加速度信号与地面真实IMU传感器数据具有强视觉对应性。

Conclusion: 3DPCNet模块有效消除了视角变异性，实现了物理上合理的运动分析，为健康监测和运动科学应用提供了可靠的姿态标准化解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种细粒度的测试时优化框架，通过分解提示词为语义概念并在全局和概念层面评估对齐度，使用细粒度CLIP变体计算概念级对应关系，通过迭代提示词优化循环提升文本到图像生成的组合忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在处理复杂提示词时经常遗漏或误表示特定对象和属性，需要在不重新训练的情况下提高生成忠实度。

Method: 将输入提示词分解为语义概念，在全局和概念层面评估对齐度，使用细粒度CLIP变体计算概念级对应关系，通过迭代提示词优化循环改进生成。

Result: 在DrawBench和CompBench提示词上的实验表明，该方法在概念覆盖率和人类评判的忠实度方面显著优于标准测试时优化和基础T2I模型。

Conclusion: 提出的细粒度测试时优化框架有效提升了文本到图像生成的组合忠实度，能够更好地渲染复杂提示词中的所有元素。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MFAS-DANet框架，解决多模态人脸防伪在域适应场景下的三个主要挑战：模态缺失、噪声伪标签和模型退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态人脸防伪模型难以检测来自新目标域的未知攻击，而域适应方法在单模态中已有研究但在多模态中仍未被探索。

Method: 1) 从其他模态提取互补特征来替代缺失模态或增强现有特征；2) 利用不同模态的预测不确定性来生成可靠的伪标签；3) 设计自适应机制，在不稳定适应时降低损失权重，在稳定适应时增加权重。

Result: 大量实验证明了MFAS-DANet的有效性和最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MFAS-DANet成功解决了多模态人脸防伪在域适应场景下的关键挑战，实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RestoRect方法，通过潜在整流流特征蒸馏解决图像恢复中性能与速度的权衡问题，结合Retinex理论和可学习扩散约束，在15个数据集上取得优越结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像恢复方法面临关键权衡：高性能模型太慢不实用，而快速模型效果差。现有静态特征匹配方法无法捕捉现代transformer架构动态生成特征的方式。

Method: 应用整流流将特征蒸馏重新表述为生成过程，学生通过潜在空间中的可学习轨迹学习合成教师质量特征。结合Retinex理论进行物理分解、可学习各向异性扩散约束和三角色彩空间极化，引入特征层提取损失实现跨架构知识迁移。

Result: 在15个图像恢复数据集、4个任务、8个指标上展示优越结果，实现更好的训练稳定性、更快的收敛和推理速度，同时保持恢复质量。

Conclusion: RestoRect通过潜在整流流特征蒸馏有效解决了图像恢复中性能与速度的权衡问题，为实际应用提供了高效高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge
transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized
transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.
RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and
inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results
across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS) 是一个从单目视频进行高质量4D重建的新框架，通过引入基于场景方向的超维表示来解决复杂动态建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于低秩假设，难以建模无约束动态场景中复杂的区域特定变形。OriGS旨在通过场景方向引导来解决这一限制。

Method: 首先估计全局方向场来传播主前进方向，然后提出方向感知超高斯表示，将时间、空间、几何和方向嵌入统一概率状态，通过条件切片推断区域特定变形。

Result: 实验证明OriGS在具有挑战性的真实世界动态场景中，相比主流方法具有优越的重建保真度。

Conclusion: OriGS通过方向锚定的高斯分布方法，成功解决了复杂动态场景的高质量4D重建问题。

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文通过大规模实证研究量化了多模态学习中的模态内依赖（单模态对任务的贡献）和模态间依赖（模态间关系），发现现有基准测试中存在视觉依赖过度和缺乏真正多模态推理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解模态内依赖和模态间依赖的相互作用对推进多模态学习至关重要，但现有基准评估中这些依赖关系的性质和交互仍缺乏系统表征。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在23个视觉问答基准上进行大规模实证研究，涵盖通用知识推理、专家知识推理、光学字符识别和文档理解等领域。

Result: 研究发现视觉、文本及其交互的依赖程度在不同基准间差异显著；许多旨在减轻文本偏见的基准反而放大了图像依赖；大模型常利用模态内依赖获得高性能，掩盖了多模态推理的缺乏。

Conclusion: 提供了多模态数据集的量化表征，为多模态基准设计和评估提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

Motivation: 息肉分割在结直肠癌检测中至关重要，但由于息肉形状、大小多样且边界对比度低，现有方法面临挑战。

Method: 集成动态核机制和全局编码器注意力模块，动态核通过全局上下文向量初始化并迭代优化分割预测，编码器注意力捕获多尺度特征，解码器使用统一通道适配标准化特征维度。

Conclusion: 该方法为息肉分割提供了稳健且适应性强的解决方案，在临床和自动化诊断系统中具有应用前景。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

Motivation: 人类能够从稀疏的视觉线索（如点光源显示）中提取丰富的语义信息，这种能力源于人类的具身经验。研究旨在测试多模态大语言模型在动作理解方面的限制。

Method: 创建了ActPLD基准，包含单人和社交互动的点光源显示数据，测试了包括最先进的专有和开源模型在内的多个多模态大语言模型。

Result: 所有测试模型在点光源显示动作理解任务上表现一致较差，揭示了模型在动作和时空理解方面存在基本差距。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在从稀疏视觉线索理解人类动作方面存在显著不足，这突显了当前模型在具身认知和时空推理能力上的局限性。

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps
in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

Conclusion: 放射组学和深度学习方法在改善系统性硬化症相关间质性肺病的早期检测和风险评估方面具有潜力，是文献中的重要进展。

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early
detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking
a significant advancement in the literature.

TL;DR: 提出了一种资源感知自适应超分辨率框架，用于优化驾驶员监控系统的模型校准和关键事件检测性能，在安全关键指标上达到最优表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员监控系统不仅需要高精度，更需要可靠、校准良好的置信度分数以确保安全关键部署。直接低分辨率训练虽然整体精度高，但预测校准差，在安全关键场景中存在危险。

Method: 采用资源感知自适应超分辨率框架，结合轻量级伪影检测器（0.3M参数，5.2ms开销）来过滤超分辨率引起的幻觉，优化模型校准和关键事件的精确召回率。

Result: 在安全中心指标上达到最先进性能：最佳校准（ECE 5.8% vs 基线6.2%）、困倦检测最高AUPR（0.78 vs 0.74）、手机使用检测的精确召回率更优（0.74 vs 0.71）。

Conclusion: 虽然低分辨率训练的视频模型是强大的通用基线，但该自适应框架代表了安全关键应用中可靠性至关重要的最先进解决方案。

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly
calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We
propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for
model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best
calibration (ECE of 5.8\% vs 6.2\% for LR-trained baselines), highest AUPR for
drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced
hallucinations. While LR-trained video models serve as strong general-purpose
baselines, our adaptive framework represents the state-of-the-art solution for
safety-critical applications where reliability is paramount.

*Hongyang Li,Jinyuan Qu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVSeg3R是一种从2D感知模型学习开放词汇3D实例分割的训练方案，利用3D重建技术将2D实例掩码投影到3D空间生成标注，通过视图实例分区和2D实例边界感知超点优化训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在从成熟的2D感知模型中学习开放词汇3D实例分割，避免昂贵的手动标注，同时使输入与现实应用对齐。

Method: 利用3D重建模型提供的2D到3D对应关系，将2D实例掩码预测投影到3D空间生成标注；提出视图实例分区算法避免错误监督；引入2D实例边界感知超点防止超点违反实例边界。

Result: 在ScanNet200基准测试上整体提升+2.3 mAP，显著缩小尾类和头类之间的性能差距；在标准开放词汇设置下，新类性能比先前方法提高约+7.1 mAP。

Conclusion: OVSeg3R不仅将最先进的封闭词汇3D实例分割模型扩展到开放词汇，还显著提升了整体性能，特别是在新类别上的表现，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着神经场景表示技术的发展，3DGS作为NeRF的显式高效替代方案，在多个领域展现出优势，需要系统分析其技术优势、适应性和局限性。

Method: 通过系统比较不同领域的专用流程，围绕统一的研究问题组织综述，分析3DGS的技术优势、多模态适应能力和现有局限。

Result: 3DGS在逼真渲染、几何保真度和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡，正逐渐取代基于NeRF的方法，成为跨领域应用的首选技术。

Conclusion: 3DGS为神经渲染技术提供了路线图，不仅用于图像合成，还支持感知、交互和内容创建，在真实和虚拟环境中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual
environments.

TL;DR: 首个用于MRI胰腺分区（头、体、尾）分割的联邦学习方法，解决了胰腺疾病区域异质性的临床挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺疾病具有显著的区域异质性（癌症多发生在头部，慢性胰腺炎导致尾部组织损失），准确分割胰腺区域对精确诊断和治疗规划至关重要。MRI中胰腺分割因形态多变、软组织对比度差和患者间解剖变异而极具挑战。

Method: 提出隐私保护的联邦学习框架，在7个医疗机构协作训练模型而不共享数据，使用711个T1W和726个T2W MRI扫描。评估三种分割架构（U-Net、Attention U-Net、Swin UNETR）与两种FL算法（FedAvg、FedProx）的组合，并引入基于解剖学知识的损失函数。

Result: 发现Attention U-Net与FedAvg组合最适合处理胰腺异质性，方法在分布式异构数据集上达到临床可用性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了MRI胰腺分区分割的技术复杂性和数据稀缺问题，为多中心协作的医学图像分析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

TL;DR: NeuroAdapter是一个视觉解码框架，直接基于脑信号表示来引导潜在扩散模型，无需中间特征空间，提供更好的生成过程透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要将脑信号映射到中间图像或文本特征空间，这掩盖了不同脑区对最终重建输出的贡献。

Method: 提出NeuroAdapter框架，直接以脑表示作为条件引导潜在扩散模型，并开发IBBI双向可解释性框架分析扩散去噪步骤中的交叉注意力机制。

Result: 在公共fMRI数据集上展示了与先前工作相当的视觉重建质量，同时提供了脑信号如何影响生成过程的更深入洞察。

Conclusion: 端到端脑到图像解码具有潜力，为通过视觉神经科学视角解释扩散模型建立了路径。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

TL;DR: 提出了RobuQ框架，通过Hadamard变换和混合精度激活量化，首次在ImageNet-1K等大型数据集上实现了平均2位激活量化的稳定图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)在图像生成中表现出色，但计算和内存成本高昂。现有量化方法难以应用于DiTs，主要因为激活量化的敏感性和分布复杂性。

Method: 1. 建立三元权重(W1.58A4)DiT基线；2. 提出RobustQuantizer进行鲁棒激活量化；3. 提出首个仅激活混合精度网络(AMPN)管道，全网络使用三元权重，各层分配不同激活精度。

Result: 在无条件/条件图像生成任务中，RobuQ在4位以下量化配置下达到最先进性能，首次在ImageNet-1K等大型数据集上实现平均2位激活量化的稳定竞争性图像生成。

Conclusion: RobuQ框架成功解决了DiTs的量化挑战，为低比特量化扩散模型的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

Motivation: 当前视频人脸增强方法面临三个主要挑战：(1) 精细纹理建模与时间一致性的平衡；(2) 高质量训练数据缺乏导致的模型泛化受限；(3) 推理过程中重复去噪步骤导致的低效率。

Method: 基于预训练WANX视频生成模型，采用单步流匹配范式；提出联合潜在-像素人脸聚焦训练策略，通过随机切换面部区域优化和全局重建进行两阶段训练；引入MLLM驱动的数据筛选流程自动选择高质量视频人脸数据集。

Result: VividFace在感知质量、身份保持和时间稳定性方面达到最先进水平，同时显著减少推理时间，为研究社区提供实用资源。

Conclusion: VividFace通过创新的单步扩散框架和训练策略，有效解决了视频人脸增强中的关键挑战，实现了高质量、高效率的人脸增强效果。

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

Motivation: 现有基于模拟图像的SAR目标识别方法存在大量无关信息干扰迁移质量，需要探索能迁移更纯净关键目标知识的新模拟数据形式。

Method: 提出多层次异构知识迁移网络(MHKT)，包含任务关联信息选择器(TAIS)分离非信息知识、目标通用知识迁移(TGKT)模块使用最大判别散度(MDD)进行分布对齐、类别关系知识迁移(CRKT)模块利用类别关系一致性约束。

Result: 在FSCM数据和实测SAR图像组成的新数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过逐步的知识选择和迁移，确保了迁移的FSCM知识的完整性，为SAR目标识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current
LoRA-adapted and

effectively controlling
  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.
A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while
maintaining high
  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration
tasks demonstrate
  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than
representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on
PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical
viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced

Conclusion: VMDiff框架能有效合成单一连贯对象，解决多源图像融合中的关键挑战

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve

TL;DR: FlowLUT是一个端到端的图像增强模型，结合了3D LUT的高效性、多先验知识和流匹配重建的参数无关特性，实现了实时处理与高表现力的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习图像增强方法在计算效率和表示能力之间的基本权衡问题，传统3D LUT虽然实时但缺乏表示灵活性且依赖固定先验。

Method: 使用可微分3D LUT集合进行色彩空间变换，轻量级内容感知网络预测融合权重实现场景自适应色彩校正，设计迭代流匹配方法恢复局部结构细节并消除伪影，在复合损失函数下联合优化。

Result: 在三个基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FlowLUT成功解决了图像增强中效率与表示能力的权衡问题，实现了实时处理与高质量增强的结合。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人-场景交互数据集交互类别不足，主要考虑与静态物体的交互，而收集可移动物体的交互数据困难且成本高。

Method: 使用3D视觉定位模型识别交互物体；提出手-物联合可供性学习预测不同手关节和物体部位的接触区域；通过局部场景建模和碰撞避免约束优化交互。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法在生成物理合理、符合文本描述的交互方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的任务和解决方案能够有效处理3D场景中可移动物体的人-物交互生成，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a
label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution
for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring,
blood flow modeling, and progression prediction. Code and dataset are

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注字符或单词级别的手写生成，在全文本行应用时效率低下且缺乏整体结构建模。

Method: 提出DiffInk框架：1) InkVAE序列变分自编码器，使用OCR损失和风格分类损失进行潜在空间正则化；2) InkDiT潜在扩散Transformer，集成目标文本和参考风格生成连贯笔迹轨迹。

Conclusion: DiffInk是首个用于全行手写生成的潜在扩散Transformer框架，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: 提出RIV模型，通过自省训练和递归推理机制为掩码扩散视觉语言模型添加自我纠错能力，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的掩码扩散视觉语言模型无法纠正生成token中的错误，缺乏自我纠错能力，这限制了模型的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 1. 自省训练：引入自省模型识别生成序列中的错误，包括语法、拼写和逻辑错误；2. 递归推理：采用交替的（解掩码→自省→重掩码）过程，递归执行直到获得可靠结果。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RIV模型实现了最先进的性能，超越了大多数现有的掩码扩散视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: RIV模型通过自省训练和递归推理机制成功为MDVLMs添加了自我纠错能力，显著提升了模型的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务密集预测在机器人应用中很重要，但面临域偏移问题。现有的多任务UDA方法主要依赖对抗学习，效果不如自训练技术。

Method: 利用分割和深度基础模型作为教师，通过自训练范式为目标域生成高质量伪标签，将鲁棒泛化能力蒸馏到单个高效学生网络中。

Result: 在标准合成到真实UDA多任务学习基准和具有挑战性的日到夜自适应任务上达到最先进性能，轻量级变体比基础模型小10倍以上。

Conclusion: FAMDA适用于创建域自适应和高效模型，特别适合资源受限的机器人应用。

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating
domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在统一处理单人和多人运动场景方面存在局限，需要更高效的运动表示和建模策略来提升LLMs在运动相关任务中的表现。

Method: 使用带残差量化的运动分词器将连续运动序列转换为多流离散token；提出延迟并行建模策略，交错编码残差token流；设计双塔架构分离运动和语言模态参数。

Result: 综合消融研究验证了各组件有效性，广泛实验表明MotionVerse在多种运动相关任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: MotionVerse通过创新的运动表示和建模策略，成功实现了LLMs在单人和多人运动场景中的统一理解和生成能力。

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

TL;DR: LightFair是一种轻量级的文本到图像扩散模型公平化方法，通过微调文本编码器的嵌入来消除偏见，无需辅助网络，训练负担仅为1/4，采样负担几乎不增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么需要全参数训练，要么依赖辅助网络进行校正，导致训练或采样负担重且性能不佳。文本编码器作为最可微调的前端模块，其输出的中性嵌入在CLIP空间中存在显著偏斜。

Method: 提出协作距离约束去偏策略，平衡嵌入距离以改善公平性；引入两阶段文本引导采样策略，限制去偏文本编码器的干预时机。

Conclusion: LightFair通过微调文本嵌入有效解决了文本到图像扩散模型的偏见问题，在保持生成质量的同时显著降低了计算负担。

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

Conclusion: EfficientMIL在显著提高计算效率的同时，在多个组织病理学数据集上优于其他多实例学习方法，且自适应补丁选择器比传统选择策略更有效。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

Motivation: 传统静态地图构建成本高、难以实时更新且缺乏跨区域泛化能力，限制了自动驾驶系统的可扩展性，因此需要转向动态的传感器驱动感知方法。

Method: 通过四个研究方向实现范式转变：紧凑空间建模（矢量化地图构建）、语义关系推理（拓扑结构建模）、鲁棒领域知识集成（先验知识融合）和基于预训练语言模型的多模态场景理解。

Result: 这些方法共同推动了从静态地图到动态感知的转变，使自动驾驶系统能够利用车载传感器数据进行实时地图构建和拓扑推理。

Conclusion: 拓扑感知感知的研究方向为构建更具适应性、可扩展性和可解释性的自动驾驶系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 文本到图像模型虽然能生成逼真图像，但文本控制限制了更精确的指导需求。需要同时定义内容及其在图像中的精确位置以实现更精细的控制。

Method: 训练免费的方法，每个参考仅需单张图像，提供对象和部件级别的显式简单控制。

Result: 在各种图像合成任务中证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现多图像布局的精确控制，为图像合成提供了更灵活和精确的工具。

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse-Up是一个内存高效的高保真纹理建模框架，通过稀疏体素引导纹理重建，使用表面锚定和视域分区来突破分辨率限制，在保持几何一致性的同时保留纹理中的高频细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D资产创建方法存在像素级痛点：高频细节丢失。现有方法要么牺牲跨视图一致性导致纹理撕裂或漂移，要么受限于显式体素的分辨率上限而丧失精细纹理细节。

Method: 使用稀疏体素指导纹理重建确保多视图一致性；采用表面锚定（可学习上采样策略将体素约束在网格表面）减少70%冗余体素；引入视域分区（图像块引导的体素分区方案）仅在可见局部块上进行梯度监督和反向传播。

Result: 显著减少高分辨率体素训练时的内存消耗，同时保持几何一致性并保留纹理中的高频细节。

Conclusion: Sparse-Up框架通过稀疏体素、表面锚定和视域分区策略，有效解决了3D纹理建模中的内存效率和高频细节保留问题。

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded

Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

*Jingqi Xu,Jingxi Lu,Chenghao Li,Sreetama Sarkar,Peter A. Beerel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HIVTP方法，通过分层视觉token剪枝提高视觉语言模型的推理效率，无需训练，使用中间层注意力图评估token重要性，在保持精度的同时显著降低推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉编码器输出的视觉token数量庞大严重阻碍推理效率，许多token不重要但可安全剪枝，现有方法效率提升有限。

Method: 使用视觉编码器中间层注意力图评估token重要性，提出分层剪枝：全局保留阶段按区域保留重要token，局部保留阶段按窗口保留最重要token。

Result: LLaVA-v1.5-7B和LLaVA-Next-7B的TTFT分别降低50.0%和55.1%，token生成吞吐量分别提升60.9%和47.3%，精度无损甚至在某些基准上有提升。

Conclusion: HIVTP在保持精度的同时显著提升推理效率，优于现有方法，为视觉语言模型高效部署提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

*Xixi Jiang,Chen Yang,Dong Zhang,Pingcheng Dong,Xin Yang,Kwang-Ting Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出STIM-TM方法，通过时空分离策略减少手术视频中的token冗余，在保持精度的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法处理手术视频时计算成本过高，且未充分考虑视频数据的时空结构和信息分布异质性。

Method: 采用时空分离策略：时间维度通过显著性加权合并连续帧的对应空间token；空间维度基于时间稳定性分析优先合并静态token。

Result: 无需训练即可实现超过65%的GFLOPs减少，同时在各种手术视频任务中保持竞争力精度。

Conclusion: STIM-TM是首个专门针对手术视频理解设计的token合并方法，有效解决了计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MSD-KMamba框架，通过双向空间感知和多尺度自蒸馏融合策略，解决3D多模态图像分割中全局注意力机制计算复杂度高的问题，在保持高计算效率的同时提升分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN-Transformer混合模型依赖高复杂度的全局注意力机制捕获长距离依赖，导致非线性计算复杂度和资源消耗。现有方法在平衡模型性能与计算效率方面存在挑战。

Method: 集成双向空间感知分支和多尺度自蒸馏融合策略。双向空间感知分支捕获脑区长距离空间上下文依赖并增强非线性特征提取；多尺度自蒸馏融合策略加强分层特征表示和语义信息传递。

Result: 在多个标准基准数据集上的实验表明，MSD-KMamba在分割精度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面均优于最先进方法，同时保持高计算效率和良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: MSD-KMamba框架有效缓解了体积分割中的二次计算复杂度瓶颈，同时解决了全局感知不足的限制，为3D多模态图像分割提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly
available at https://github.com/daimao-zhang/MSD-KMamba.

TL;DR: 提出了QuantSparse统一框架，将模型量化与注意力稀疏化结合，通过多尺度显著注意力蒸馏和二阶稀疏注意力重参数化，显著提升扩散变换器的压缩效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在视频生成方面表现出色，但计算和内存成本过高阻碍实际部署。单独使用模型量化或注意力稀疏化在激进压缩下会导致严重性能下降，需要找到有效的结合方法。

Method: 1. 多尺度显著注意力蒸馏：利用全局结构指导和局部显著监督来减轻量化引起的偏差
2. 二阶稀疏注意力重参数化：利用二阶残差的时间稳定性来有效恢复稀疏化丢失的信息

Result: 在HunyuanVideo-13B上，QuantSparse达到20.88 PSNR，显著优于最先进的量化基线Q-VDiT（16.85 PSNR），同时实现3.68倍的存储减少和1.88倍的端到端推理加速。

Conclusion: QuantSparse成功解决了量化与稀疏化结合时的性能退化问题，为扩散变换器的实际部署提供了高效的压缩解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}
reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end
inference. Our code will be released in

TL;DR: 提出了HomeSafeBench基准测试，用于评估具身代理在家庭安全检查任务中的能力，包含12,900个数据点，涵盖五种常见家庭安全隐患。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在两个关键限制：1）使用文本描述而非视觉信息，无法准确评估基于视觉语言模型的具身代理；2）使用单一静态视角，限制了代理的自由探索，可能导致遗漏被遮挡的安全隐患。

Method: 提供动态第一人称视角图像，允许具身代理在模拟家庭环境中自由探索，获得多个动态视角以进行更彻底的检查。

Result: 对主流视觉语言模型的综合评估显示，即使表现最佳的模型F1分数也仅为10.23%，模型在识别安全隐患和选择有效探索策略方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench将为未来家庭安全检查相关研究提供有价值的参考和支持，数据集和代码将公开发布。

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出使用多种骨干网络的SSD模型集成方法，通过加权框融合(WBF)技术提升武器检测的鲁棒性，在复杂场景下实现了2.948%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共空间安全监控系统在部分遮挡、光照变化和复杂背景等挑战性条件下，单一模型检测器往往缺乏鲁棒性，需要更可靠的武器检测方法。

Method: 使用VGG16、ResNet50、EfficientNet和MobileNetV3四种不同骨干网络训练多个SSD模型，然后采用加权框融合(WBF)方法集成这些模型的预测结果。

Result: 采用'max'置信度评分策略的WBF方法达到了0.838的mAP，相比最佳单一模型相对提升了2.948%，并优于其他融合启发式方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明融合策略与集成多样性同等重要，置信度感知融合是提升集成检测器准确性的关键机制，为实时武器检测提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

Motivation: 解决协作感知系统中频繁合作交互和实时性要求带来的严格带宽限制问题，同时弥补LiDAR聚焦实现中性能不足的缺陷。

Method: 提出INSTINCT框架，包含：1）质量感知过滤机制选择高质量实例特征；2）双分支检测路由解耦协作相关和不相关实例；3）跨智能体本地实例融合模块聚合混合实例特征；4）增强GT采样技术。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和V2V4Real数据集上，精度分别提升13.23%和33.08%，同时通信带宽降至现有最佳方法的1/281和1/264。

Conclusion: INSTINCT在显著降低通信带宽需求的同时实现了优越的性能，为协作感知系统提供了高效的实例级交互解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: CrimEdit是一个统一的图像编辑模型，通过联合训练移除和插入任务嵌入，在分类器无指导方案中增强对象及其效果的移除，并在插入过程中实现对象效果的可控合成，还能在单个去噪步骤中实现对象移动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法虽然通过处理对象效果（如阴影和反射）提升了对象移除和插入的性能，但使用分类器无指导来处理对象效果在统一模型中的性能影响尚未充分探索。为提高复合编辑的效率，需要开发一个能同时处理移除和插入任务的统一模型。

Method: 提出CrimEdit方法，在单个模型中联合训练移除和插入的任务嵌入，并在分类器无指导方案中利用这些嵌入。该方法还扩展了两个任务提示，使其能应用于空间上不同的区域，从而在单个去噪步骤中实现对象移动（重新定位）。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，CrimEdit在对象移除、可控效果插入和高效对象移动方面实现了优越性能，无需额外训练或单独的移除和插入阶段。

Conclusion: CrimEdit通过联合训练任务嵌入和利用分类器无指导，成功实现了高效的对象移除、可控效果插入和对象移动，为复合图像编辑提供了一个统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

Conclusion: PD-Diag-Net通过整合临床先验知识，实现了高效准确的帕金森病自动化诊断，在外部验证中表现出色，特别在早期诊断方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

Conclusion: DiffPCN成功将扩散模型应用于点云补全任务，通过创新的两阶段方法实现了高质量的点云补全效果。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for

TL;DR: 提出了M3DLayout数据集，这是一个用于3D室内布局生成的大规模多源数据集，包含15,080个布局和超过258k个对象实例，整合了真实世界扫描、专业CAD设计和程序生成场景三种来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D室内布局生成模型的学习能力受到现有数据集规模有限、多样性不足和标注质量不高的限制，需要更丰富的数据资源来提升模型性能。

Method: 构建了包含真实扫描、CAD设计和程序生成场景的多源数据集，每个布局都配有详细的结构化文本描述，包括全局场景摘要、大型家具的关系布局和小物品的细粒度排列。

Result: 通过基于文本条件扩散模型的基准测试，实验结果表明该数据集为训练布局生成模型提供了坚实基础，多源组成增强了多样性，特别是Inf3DLayout子集提供了丰富的小物体信息，能够生成更复杂和详细的场景。

Conclusion: M3DLayout可以作为推进文本驱动3D场景合成研究的有价值资源。

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了LUQ：分层超低比特量化方法，通过选择性对多模态LLM中更耐受量化的层应用超低比特（<4位）量化，在保持性能的同时显著减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型部署需要巨大内存和计算资源，而现有的超低比特量化方法主要针对纯语言模型，对多模态LLM的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出LUQ方法：1）分析发现多模态token的激活分布在不同层间差异显著；2）选择性对更耐受量化的层应用超低比特量化；3）使用混合多模态token进行PTQ以提升VQA性能。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5和Qwen-2.5-VL上的实验显示，LUQ模型比4位量化模型分别减少40%和31%内存使用，在MME基准上性能下降小于10%。

Conclusion: LUQ方法通过分层选择性量化策略，成功实现了多模态LLM的超低比特量化，在显著减少内存占用的同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraTok是一个基于多尺度Vision Transformer的视觉分词器，通过多尺度下采样和尺度因果注意力机制，在图像重建和生成任务中显著优于单尺度方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统单尺度表示建模的局限性，通过多尺度表示来更好地捕捉从全局语义特征到局部结构细节的视觉信息。

Method: 使用多尺度下采样生成多尺度token序列，并设计尺度因果注意力机制实现从低分辨率全局特征到高分辨率细节的渐进信息流动。

Result: 在相同设置下，相比单尺度方法rFID提升27.2%(1.47→1.07)，下游生成任务收敛速度提升1.38倍，gFID提升18.9%(16.4→13.3)。通过扩展训练达到ViT分词器中最优的rFID 0.45和gFID 1.82。

Conclusion: HieraTok是首个多尺度ViT分词器，其多尺度设计和更平滑的潜在空间分布显著提升了视觉生成任务的性能，为ViT分词器在视觉生成任务中的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了优越的重建精度，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: GRS-SLAM3R通过空间记忆和子图策略有效解决了稠密SLAM中的全局一致性问题，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: ResAD++通过残差特征学习和特征超球约束有效解决了类无关异常检测中的特征相关性问题，实现了对新类别异常检测的强泛化能力

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at

Conclusion: 自精炼过程能显著提升视觉语言模型在视觉指向任务中的性能，为未来研究提供了训练代码、数据集和模型检查点

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

Conclusion: GenView++通过同时解决正样本对构建和学习的挑战，在视觉和视觉-语言任务中都取得了显著性能提升，证明了其方法的有效性。

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 通过纹理向量量化和重建感知预测策略，有效解决了VQ方法在视觉先验建模中的量化误差和预测精度问题，实现了高质量的超分辨率重建。

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

Method: 提出Group Context Optimization (GroupCoOp)，使用组特定文本提示作为组代表，为每个目标类别构建多个分类器。利用VLM文本编码器的丰富语义知识，即使对于训练样本较少的组也能发现有效的组提示。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五种CLIP架构上取得了最佳结果，有时甚至优于微调整个网络的方法，而仅训练了网络参数的0.016%。

Conclusion: GroupCoOp是一种简单有效的去偏微调算法，能够显著提升微调后视觉语言模型的群体鲁棒性，同时保持参数高效性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法提高了AI生成关卡的稳定性和可玩性。

Conclusion: 虽然评估针对Angry Birds，但基于图像的方法设计适用于具有类似关卡结构的各种2D游戏。

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of
diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content
creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了可控的大规模3D城市布局生成，在几何连续性和语义控制方面表现出色。

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric
continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural
relations yet overlook parcel semantics. We present a controllable framework
for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry
and semantics. By fusing geometric and semantic attributes, introducing edge
weights, and embedding building height in the graph, our method extends 2D
layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control
the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven
planning and design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视角成像或人工检测方法存在遮挡、视角受限和光照不一致等问题，需要额外检测工位，导致生产线中断和成本增加。

Method: 集成多摄像头成像系统与先进目标检测算法，采用三视角图像采集和定制化图像融合方法，结合专门开发的多场景标注数据集。

Conclusion: 该工作通过克服单视角限制，为工业自动化提供了可扩展、成本效益高且准确的质量控制机制，确保装配线的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to
facilitate further research in this domain.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个视觉隐私分类法，用于评估视觉语言模型对隐私的理解能力，发现现有模型在理解上下文隐私方面存在显著不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在推理和文本理解方面表现出色，但在理解隐私概念方面存在明显局限，需要测试这些模型理解和执行隐私原则的能力。

Method: 引入了一个全面的、多层次的视觉隐私分类法，该分类法捕捉了广泛的隐私问题，并评估了多个最先进的视觉语言模型的能力。

Result: 评估显示，现有视觉语言模型在理解上下文隐私方面存在显著不一致性，表明当前模型在隐私意识方面存在严重不足。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来研究提供了基础分类法，并对当前模型局限性进行了关键基准测试，证明了迫切需要更强大、更具隐私意识的AI系统。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

*Hanyu Zhou,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni4D-LLM是首个统一4D场景理解和生成的视觉语言模型框架，通过共享表示和架构实现时空感知的4D视觉任务统一处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D和4D方法通常在语义理解中使用自回归模型，在内容生成中使用扩散模型，这种范式差距阻碍了单一模型同时处理理解和生成任务，特别是在需要时空建模的动态4D场景中。

Method: 1) 提取语义特征用于理解，注入噪声的外观特征用于生成，结合4D几何线索，通过自适应交叉注意力融合为时空感知的视觉表示；2) 将自回归和扩散构建在Transformer骨干上，集成到具有任务特定头的单一LLM中；3) 通过指令微调提高跨任务泛化能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，Uni4D-LLM相比最先进模型取得了竞争性或更优的结果，首次实现了4D场景理解和生成的真正统一。

Conclusion: Uni4D-LLM通过共享表示和架构的设计，成功构建了首个能够统一处理4D场景理解和生成任务的视觉语言模型框架，为物理世界的视觉语言统一建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了Segment Concept (SeC)框架在MOSEv2数据集上的零样本性能，该框架使用大型视觉语言模型建立目标对象的深度语义理解，在复杂视频对象分割挑战中获得第二名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的半监督视频对象分割方法主要依赖外观模式匹配，在面临剧烈视觉变化、遮挡和场景转换等挑战时鲁棒性有限，缺乏对目标对象的高层次概念理解。

Method: 使用Segment Concept (SeC)框架，该框架利用大型视觉语言模型建立目标对象的深度语义理解，实现更持久的视频分割。

Result: 在MOSEv2测试集上实现了39.7的JFn分数，在第七届大规模视频对象分割挑战的复杂VOS赛道中排名第二，且未在训练集上进行任何微调。

Conclusion: SeC框架通过深度语义理解显著提升了视频对象分割在复杂场景下的鲁棒性和性能，证明了概念理解在分割任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到3D质量评估存在基准过时、碎片化、粒度粗等问题，且现有客观指标存在设计局限，导致特征提取不具代表性和鲁棒性下降。

Method: 1) 构建T23D-CompBench基准，定义5个组件12个子组件的组合提示，生成3600个纹理网格；2) 进行大规模主观实验收集129600个可靠人类评分；3) 提出Rank2Score两阶段训练评估器，第一阶段通过监督对比回归和课程学习增强成对训练，第二阶段使用平均意见分数优化预测。

Result: Rank2Score在多个维度上持续优于现有指标，并可作为奖励函数优化生成模型。

Conclusion: T23D-CompBench和Rank2Score为文本到3D质量评估提供了全面基准和有效评估器，显著提升了与人类判断的一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于概念的解释方法CE-FAM，通过融合激活映射来同时揭示图像分类器学习的概念、相关区域及其对预测的贡献，无需标注数据集即可处理任意概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的显著性映射方法只能突出重要区域但需要用户自行解释含义，而基于概念的解释方法虽然能分解AI预测但很少能同时揭示学习的概念、相关区域及其贡献。

Method: 使用分支网络共享图像分类器的激活映射，学习模仿视觉语言模型的嵌入，通过概念预测分数的梯度加权激活映射来表示概念区域，并基于对图像分类分数的影响量化其贡献。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明该方法优于现有方法，在未见概念的零样本推理方面表现出色，并引入了新的概念区域准确性评估指标。

Conclusion: CE-FAM提供了一个通用框架，能够识别概念区域及其贡献，同时利用VLM知识处理任意概念而无需标注数据集。

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

TL;DR: FairViT-GAN是一个新颖的混合框架，结合CNN和ViT的优势，通过对抗性去偏机制解决面部美预测中的架构限制、人口统计偏见和透明度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部美预测模型存在架构限制（CNN缺乏全局和谐性，ViT忽略细粒度细节）、人口统计偏见和透明度不足的问题。

Method: 提出FairViT-GAN混合框架：CNN分支提取局部特征，ViT分支建模全局上下文，并引入对抗性去偏机制使特征表示对受保护属性不变。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准测试中，达到皮尔逊相关系数0.9230和RMSE 0.2650的新SOTA，种族子组间性能差距减少82.9%，对抗者分类准确率降至52.1%。

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN为开发负责任的主观视觉评估AI系统提供了鲁棒、透明且显著更公平的蓝图。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现典型的DETR增强策略在时序语句定位任务中不仅没有改善性能，反而可能降低性能，需要分析根本原因并解决查询冲突问题。

Method: 在DETR解码器层进行两个小修改：(1)基于语义和位置重叠约束查询间的自注意力；(2)添加查询-帧对齐来桥接全局和局部上下文。

Result: Sim-DETR释放了DETR在时序语句定位任务中的全部潜力，为未来研究提供了强大的基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析DETR在时序语句定位中的异常行为，提出的Sim-DETR方法有效解决了查询冲突问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型面临关键弱点：渐进分辨率缩放导致跨时间步的补丁间信息不一致，这些不一致会分散引导信号，使其偏离条件信息，留下模糊不忠实的特征。

Method: IGG机制通过注意力自适应地增强采样过程中的信息丰富补丁，确保引导与内容保持紧密对齐。

Result: 在类别条件和文本到图像生成任务中，IGG生成更清晰、更连贯且语义接地的图像，为基于AR的方法设立了新基准。

Conclusion: IGG通过信息接地引导有效解决了自回归图像生成中的信息不一致问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量和语义忠实度。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AssemblyHands-X，首个无标记的3D手-身体基准数据集，用于研究双手活动中手-身体协调对动作识别的影响。实验表明基于姿态的动作推理比视频基线更高效准确，联合建模手和身体线索能提升识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D活动数据集通常只标注手或身体姿态，而基于标记的运动捕捉系统存在视觉伪影问题，限制了模型在自然无标记视频上的泛化能力。需要系统评估双手活动中手-身体协调对动作理解的影响。

Method: 构建了从同步多视角视频进行3D姿态标注的流程，结合多视角三角测量和SMPL-X网格拟合，实现手和上半身的可靠3D配准。验证了不同输入表示（视频、手姿态、身体姿态、手-身体姿态）在图卷积或时空注意力模型上的表现。

Result: 基于姿态的动作推理比视频基线更高效和准确。联合建模手和身体线索比单独使用手或上半身能改善动作识别，突出了建模相互依赖的手-身体动态对于双手活动整体理解的重要性。

Conclusion: 手-身体协调在双手活动理解中具有重要作用，联合建模手和身体动态能显著提升动作识别性能，为双手活动的整体理解提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

*Jinghan Xu Yuyang Zhang Qixuan Cai Jiancheng Chen Keqiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出跨模态对比遗忘框架CCU，通过选择性视觉遗忘、跨模态知识保留和双集对比分离来解决多模态应用中视觉隐私泄露问题，在保持其他模态性能的同时显著提升遗忘效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态应用（如自动驾驶）中，视觉模态最容易泄露隐私；现有机器遗忘方法在视觉遗忘时会破坏跨模态知识并影响保留数据的类内结构稳定性，导致整体性能下降。

Method: CCU框架包含三个关键组件：(1)选择性视觉遗忘：使用反向对比学习分离视觉表示与原语义；(2)跨模态知识保留：通过语义一致性保持其他模态的判别能力；(3)双集对比分离：通过隔离遗忘集和保留集的结构扰动来保持模型性能。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，CCU方法相比最佳基线实现了7.12%的准确率提升，同时仅需7%的遗忘时间。

Conclusion: CCU框架有效解决了多模态视觉遗忘中的跨模态知识保留和结构稳定性问题，在保持性能的同时显著提高了遗忘效率。

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Motivation: 解决需要同时理解图像和文本的复杂临床问题仍然是医疗AI的主要挑战，现有模型在处理这类多模态任务时存在性能瓶颈。

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换将医学图像和文本特征转换到频域，结合量子检索系统从外部源获取医学知识，并将检索信息与频域特征融合进行推理。

Result: 在VQA-RAD数据集上的评估显示，Q-FSRU在需要图像文本推理的复杂病例上优于现有模型，频率和量子信息的结合提升了性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建智能、清晰且对医生有帮助的AI工具提供了一种有前景的途径。

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

Motivation: 医学影像基础模型需要随时间适应，但完全重新训练受到隐私约束和成本的限制。需要一种既能保护隐私又能高效适应的方法。

Method: 使用类别条件扩散重放与弹性权重巩固相结合的持续学习框架，采用紧凑的Vision Transformer骨干网络，在MedMNIST v2和CheXpert数据集上评估。

Result: 在CheXpert上达到0.851 AUROC，相比DER++减少遗忘超过30%，接近联合训练的0.869 AUROC，同时保持高效和隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床影像模型的可扩展、隐私感知的持续适应提供了一条实用路径，分析显示遗忘与重放保真度和Fisher加权参数漂移相关。

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,
privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

<details>

Motivation: 医疗领域联邦学习中存在数据模态异质性挑战，不同客户端可能拥有不同模态的医疗图像，这给跨域医疗图像分割带来困难。

Method: 提出联邦域适应（FedDA）分割训练框架，通过嵌入对抗训练机制在客户端间进行特征级对抗学习，对齐跨客户端的特征映射。

Result: 在三个医疗图像数据集上的实验表明，FedDA实现了跨域联邦聚合，赋予单模态客户端跨模态处理能力，在客观和主观评估中均优于现有联邦聚合算法。

Conclusion: FedDA框架能有效解决联邦学习中的域偏移问题，提升模型在异质医疗数据上的泛化性能。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

Motivation: 当前指令引导的图像编辑模型在处理复杂指令时仍面临挑战，且常需多次尝试才能获得满意结果。强化学习虽具潜力，但缺乏高保真、高效的奖励信号阻碍了其在图像编辑领域的应用。

Method: 首先构建EditReward-Bench基准系统评估奖励模型，然后开发EditScore系列奖励模型（7B-72B），通过精细数据筛选和针对生成特性的自集成策略优化模型性能。

Result: EditScore在基准测试中表现优异，最大变体甚至超越GPT-5。实验表明，EditScore能够实现高效稳健的策略优化，应用于OmniGen2基础模型可获得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次系统性地从基准测试到奖励建模再到强化学习训练，证明了高保真、领域专业化的奖励模型是释放强化学习在图像编辑领域全部潜力的关键。

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

Conclusion: MoReact方法在文本驱动的人类反应生成任务中表现出色，能够产生语义一致且真实的互动动作序列。

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

TL;DR: 本文通过系统实验分析多任务学习中的优化不平衡问题，发现任务特定梯度范数与优化不平衡强相关，并提出基于梯度范数缩放任务损失的简单策略，可达到与昂贵网格搜索相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习(MTL)旨在通过单个网络联合执行多个任务来构建通用视觉系统，但其潜力常被"优化不平衡"问题阻碍，即任务干扰导致性能不如单任务模型。

Method: 进行系统实验分析，研究导致优化不平衡的因素，并基于任务特定梯度范数与优化不平衡的强相关性，提出通过梯度范数缩放任务损失的策略。

Result: 实验证实现有优化方法在不同数据集上表现不一致，先进架构仍依赖昂贵的网格搜索损失权重；视觉基础模型(VFMs)虽提供强初始化但无法解决优化不平衡；增加数据量收益有限；基于梯度范数的损失缩放策略能达到与网格搜索相当的性能。

Conclusion: 理解和控制梯度动态是解决多任务学习优化不平衡问题的更直接路径，而非开发日益复杂的方法。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了CLIP模型在多任务下的对抗样本迁移行为，发现细粒度任务生成的对抗样本具有更强的跨任务迁移能力，并提出了MT-AdvCLIP框架来增强对抗攻击的跨任务泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: CLIP作为通用视觉语言预训练模型在粗粒度任务上表现良好，但在细粒度任务上表现不佳，且其对抗鲁棒性研究不足。理解对抗样本在任务间的迁移行为对评估CLIP的泛化极限和安全风险至关重要。

Method: 提出了多任务对抗CLIP框架(MT-AdvCLIP)，引入任务感知特征聚合损失，生成具有增强跨任务泛化能力的扰动，强化细粒度任务模型对共享CLIP骨干网络的攻击效果。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，MT-AdvCLIP显著提高了对抗迁移成功率（多任务平均攻击成功率提升超过39%），且不增加扰动预算。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了多任务CLIP模型中对抗样本的迁移机制，为多任务鲁棒性评估和对抗样本设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在文本引导图像修复中难以同时保证提示细节对齐和背景一致性的问题，探索MAR模型在此任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用掩码自回归模型，引入双流编码器信息融合(DEIF)在频域融合文本和背景信息生成引导token，以及自适应解码器注意力增强(ADAE)来提升注意力分数。

Result: 在几乎所有指标上都优于现有最先进方法，提供更优的视觉结果。

Conclusion: Token Painter方法有效解决了文本引导图像修复中的提示对齐和背景一致性问题，无需训练即可达到SOTA性能。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

### [183] [Learning Encoding-Decoding Direction Pairs to Unveil Concepts of Influence in Deep Vision Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23926)
*Alexandros Doumanoglou,Kurt Driessens,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从深度视觉网络中提取概念嵌入的新方法，通过编码方向和解码方向对来表示概念，并利用不确定性区域对齐技术揭示影响预测的可解释方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络中的概念表示为潜在空间中的方向，但现有的矩阵分解、自编码器或字典学习方法依赖特征重建，需要新的视角来更好地理解和解释这些概念表示。

Method: 通过方向聚类识别解码方向，在概率视角下用信号向量估计编码方向，并利用网络权重通过不确定性区域对齐技术揭示可解释方向。

Result: 在合成数据中恢复真实方向对；在真实数据中解码方向映射到单语义可解释概念且优于无监督基线；信号向量能忠实估计编码方向。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效理解模型全局行为、解释个体预测，并通过干预产生反事实或纠正错误，为深度网络的可解释性提供了新工具。

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SAR-KnowLIP，首个通用的SAR多模态基础模型，包含可重用数据和评估基准。通过引入地理信息属性、构建大规模SAR数据集、使用层次认知思维链生成对齐文本，以及设计自一致迭代优化机制，在11个下游任务中表现出领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态AI方法主要针对RGB图像，在合成孔径雷达(SAR)图像建模方面存在显著空白。SAR具有全天候成像能力，在遥感场景理解中具有不可替代的作用。

Method: 1) 构建SAR-GEOVL-1M数据集，包含12万张图像和135个城市；2) 使用层次认知思维链生成对齐的结构化文本；3) 设计自一致迭代优化机制，通过对比、匹配和重建学习的自监督闭环增强跨模态对齐；4) 建立统一评估基准。

Conclusion: SAR-KnowLIP的大规模多模态数据、可迁移模型架构和全面实验基准将显著推进SAR多模态基线模型的发展。

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoPrune是一种训练免费、即插即用的视觉语言模型剪枝框架，通过量化视觉和文本token之间的互信息，生成适应不同样本和任务复杂度的剪枝策略，在保持高精度的同时大幅减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法采用固定的层特定剪枝策略，无法适应不同输入样本和任务的复杂度变化，未能与模型的整体推理轨迹对齐。认知科学表明人类视觉处理从广泛探索开始，随着目标明确逐渐聚焦，模型中也存在类似模式。

Method: AutoPrune量化视觉和文本token之间的互信息，将其投影到预算约束的逻辑保留曲线。每个逻辑曲线对应特定任务复杂度，确保满足预定义的计算约束。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上，AutoPrune剪枝89%的视觉token，推理FLOPs减少76.8%，同时保持所有任务平均96.7%的原始准确率，比PDrop方法提升9.1%。

Conclusion: AutoPrune通过复杂度自适应剪枝策略，有效平衡了视觉语言模型的计算效率和性能，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个自动汽车损伤检测系统，通过将2D掩码提升到3D空间进行损伤分割，并引入无需学习的单视图3D高斯泼溅分割方法，特别适用于只有单视图可见的损伤检测场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有汽车损伤检测方法大多基于2D图像分析，缺乏3D重建方法的全面性和几何精度。3D高斯泼溅技术能从有限视角生成准确一致的3D重建，但需要解决单视图损伤检测的挑战。

Method: 通过结构从运动获取相机参数，将高斯投影到图像平面，利用Z缓冲和深度、不透明度的正态分布模型进行高斯过滤，实现单视图3D高斯泼溅分割。

Result: 该方法在具有挑战性的汽车损伤检测场景中表现有效，特别是对于仅在单视图中清晰可见的目标物体（如划痕、小凹陷）。

Conclusion: 提出的学习免费单视图3D高斯泼溅分割方法为汽车损伤检测提供了实用解决方案，特别适用于多视图一致性方法不适用的情况。

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有的REC和REG数据集依赖人工标注，成本高且难以扩展，需要自动化数据生成方法来解决这一瓶颈。

Method: 采用协作多模态模型交互(CMMI)策略，结合MLLMs和LLMs的语义理解能力生成描述；设计空间渐进增强(SPA)模块提升重复实例间的空间表达能力。

Conclusion: ColLab为多模态理解任务提供了高效的数据生成解决方案，已被ICCV 2025 MARS2挑战赛部分采用，丰富了数据集的多样性和挑战性。

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial
progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data
generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a
Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the
semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large
language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a
module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in
the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal
Reasoning, enriching the dataset with diverse and challenging samples that
better reflect real-world reasoning demands.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RLIR（逆向奖励强化学习）框架，通过逆向动力学模型从生成视频中恢复输入动作，为视频世界模型提供可验证的奖励信号，提升动作跟随能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频世界模型在视觉质量和时间一致性方面有进步，但在准确建模人类指定动作方面研究不足。传统强化学习后训练方法因大规模偏好标注成本高昂和基于规则的视频验证器不可行而难以应用。

Method: 使用逆向动力学模型将高维视频模态映射到低维动作空间，通过恢复输入动作来获得可验证的奖励信号，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization进行优化。

Result: 在自回归和扩散范式下，动作跟随能力提升5-10%，视觉质量提升达10%，获得更高的人类偏好评分。

Conclusion: RLIR是首个专门设计用于增强视频世界模型动作跟随能力的后训练方法，在多个指标上均取得显著改进。

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

Motivation: 甲状腺癌全球发病率上升，及时准确的诊断对治疗策略和患者预后至关重要。需要开发高性能的智能分类方法来辅助临床诊断。

Method: 将自适应CNN与CDF9/7小波结合，通过n-scroll混沌系统调制小波细节系数来增强判别特征。使用5折交叉验证在DDTI数据集上评估。

Result: 在DDTI数据集上达到98.17%准确率、98.76%敏感性、97.58%特异性、97.55% F1分数和0.9912 AUC。混沌调制使准确率比仅使用CDF9/7的CNN提升8.79个百分点。在TCIA数据集上准确率为95.82%，在ISIC皮肤病变子集上为97.31%。

Conclusion: 小波-混沌-CNN管道在甲状腺超声分类中实现了最先进的性能，具有强大的泛化能力和实用的运行时特性，适合临床集成。

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

TL;DR: 提出VFSI方法，在扩散采样过程中通过基于能量的引导来强制执行物理约束，无需重新训练模型，显著提高了交通仿真的物理有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型生成的交通仿真虽然逼真，但系统性地违反物理约束，50%的轨迹存在碰撞、偏离道路等问题，需要解决物理有效性这一根本限制。

Method: 使用基于能量的引导方法，在扩散采样过程中将碰撞避免和运动学约束作为能量函数，引导去噪过程生成物理有效的轨迹。

Result: 在Waymo数据集200个场景中，碰撞率降低67%（24.6%到8.1%），整体有效性提升87%（50.3%到94.2%），同时ADE指标从1.34m提升到1.21m。

Conclusion: 在推理过程中显式执行约束对于物理有效的交通仿真既是必要的也是充分的，模型无关的方法证明了这一有效性。

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

TL;DR: 提出OASIS，一种用于真实世界视频超分辨率的高效单步扩散模型，通过注意力专业化路由和渐进式训练策略解决扩散模型在VSR中的冗余问题，实现SOTA性能和6.2倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用生成式扩散模型到视频超分辨率会导致冗余，因为低质量视频已包含大量内容信息，这增加了计算开销和学习负担。

Method: 引入注意力专业化路由机制，根据注意力头的内在行为将其分配到不同模式；采用渐进式训练策略，从时间一致的退化开始训练，再转向不一致设置。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上达到最先进性能，相比SeedVR2等单步扩散基线模型提供6.2倍推理加速。

Conclusion: OASIS通过注意力专业化有效减少冗余并保留预训练知识，结合渐进式训练策略，在视频超分辨率任务中实现了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

Motivation: 360度图像在各领域应用日益广泛，但获取大规模标注数据集用于360度深度估计仍然是一个重大挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法利用基础模型的零样本鲁棒性，无需训练即可实现高质量的360度深度估计，并展示了在下游任务中的实用价值。

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance
gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training
framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim
Agents Challenge (WOSAC) showcase that SMART-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the
leaderboard at the time of submission.

Abstract: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing Acute Coronary
Syndrome (ACS). However, its resource-intensive and invasive nature can expose
patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed
treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep
learning framework for ACS treatment prediction that leverages non-invasive
modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video
interpretation, along with a late fusion mechanism to align predictions across
modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms
unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an
AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy
for intervention prediction. These findings highlight the potential of
TREAT-Net as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate patient triage,
particularly in underserved populations with limited access to coronary
angiography.

Conclusion: SIE3D框架成功实现了从单张图像和文本生成高质量3D头像，提供了精细的表情控制能力，在计算效率和生成质量方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,
as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via
text. This paper proposes SIE3D, a framework that generates expressive 3D
avatars from a single image and descriptive text. SIE3D fuses identity features
from the image with semantic embedding from text through a novel conditioning
scheme, enabling detailed control. To ensure generated expressions accurately
match the text, it introduces an innovative perceptual expression loss
function. This loss uses a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize the
generation process, guaranteeing expression accuracy. Extensive experiments
show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming
competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a
single consumer-grade GPU. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解模型采用固定的帧采样策略，无法根据具体问题的推理需求自适应地收集视觉证据，导致在需要广泛时间覆盖或精细空间细节的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出FrameMind框架，采用多轮交替的文本推理和主动视觉感知，使用动态分辨率帧采样(DRFS)训练动态采样策略，以及DRFS-GRPO算法从基于结果的奖励中学习。

Result: 在MLVU和VideoMME等挑战性基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有模型，推进了灵活高效视频理解的技术水平。

Conclusion: FrameMind通过动态视觉信息请求机制，成功解决了传统固定采样策略的局限性，为视频理解任务提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对高光谱图像的广义类别发现框架，通过原型子空间建模来更好地捕捉类别结构，显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要针对RGB图像，其假设和建模策略不适用于高维且具有复杂光谱结构的高光谱图像

Method: 使用一组基向量为每个类别建模子空间表示，引入基向量正交性约束和重构约束来指导学习

Result: 在真实高光谱图像数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于最先进的GCD方法

Conclusion: 为高光谱场景下的广义类别发现建立了坚实基础

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了雾霾天气下行人轨迹预测的挑战，为恶劣环境中的智能交通感知提供了可靠的技术方案。

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出直接在原始Bayer马赛克数据上进行图像重建，相比传统的ISP后处理sRGB图像能获得更好的重建效果，特别是在雨雾退化场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像重建网络在ISP处理后的sRGB图像上训练，但ISP处理会不可逆地混合颜色、裁剪动态范围并模糊细节。作者希望通过直接在原始Bayer数据上学习来避免这些损失。

Method: 使用雨雾退化问题作为案例，评估ISP后处理和Bayer重建流程；创建Raw-Rain基准数据集（首个包含12位Bayer和位深度匹配sRGB的真实雨景数据集）；引入信息守恒评分(ICS)作为颜色不变性指标。

Result: 在测试集上，原始域模型将sRGB结果提升了+0.99 dB PSNR和+1.2% ICS，同时运行速度更快，计算量减半。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持低层视觉采用ISP后处理范式，并为端到端可学习相机管道打开了大门。

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end
learnable camera pipelines.

Motivation: 现有超像素方法通常独立于聚类任务进行分割，导致分割结果与后续聚类目标不一致，且计算和内存成本高限制了可扩展性。

Method: 使用基于展开ADMM的自表示网络提供模型驱动信号，指导可微分超像素模块，联合优化超像素分割和子空间聚类，每个超像素学习独特的紧凑度参数。

Conclusion: 提出的联合优化框架能够产生聚类感知的分割，同时保持光谱和空间结构，实现更灵活和自适应的分割。

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

TL;DR: 该研究发现，在预训练视觉模型上进行剪枝时，即使只使用一个任务的数据进行剪枝，也能保持模型在未见任务上的零样本性能。此外，对这些剪枝模型进行微调不仅能提升原始任务性能，还能恢复在保留任务上的表现。

Method: 研究分析了在预训练视觉模型上进行初始化剪枝的方法，特别关注使用不同任务数据对剪枝效果的影响。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，仅在一个任务上进行剪枝就能保持模型在未见任务上的零样本性能。微调这些剪枝模型不仅能提升原始任务性能，还能恢复保留任务的性能。

Conclusion: 这种现象归因于在大规模数据集上进行广泛预训练所诱导的有利损失景观，表明预训练模型具有强大的泛化能力，即使经过剪枝压缩后仍能保持多任务性能。

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态基准测试中表现良好，但在结构化推理和精确定位方面仍有局限。现有研究表明添加简单的视觉结构（如分区和标注）能提高准确性，但其内部机制尚不清楚。

Method: 通过表征分析研究外部线索如何诱导Grounding IDs，发现这些标识符在嵌入空间中形成稳健的分区内对齐，并减少图像和文本之间的模态差距。使用因果干预验证这些标识符在对象与符号线索绑定中的中介作用。

Conclusion: Grounding IDs是解释外部线索如何增强多模态绑定的关键机制，既提供了可解释性，又在实际应用中提高了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

Result: 基于立方体的预测在质量、速度和时序一致性方面表现最优，超越现有基准，实现更快推理并支持分钟级序列生成。

Conclusion: 移除帧逐帧约束的视频生成器性能更优，激励重新思考视频和其他时空域中的序列分解方法。

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse
modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and
human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient
framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

Conclusion: SVAC通过扩大输入规模和智能压缩策略，有效提升了RVOS的性能和效率。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in
video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances
in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance
through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including
insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational
and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex
temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves
RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance
video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting
computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal
Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential
spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)
strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video
clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code

*Zhecheng Li,Guoxian Song,Yiwei Wang,Zhen Xiong,Junsong Yuan,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GMS框架，通过将通用视觉语言模型作为扫描器和专用定位器模型协同工作，实现从粗到细的GUI元素定位，在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上达到35.7%的准确率，比单独模型提升10倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然语言查询在图形用户界面中的定位问题，需要模型理解多样化的UI元素并准确预测空间坐标，这是一个具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 采用粗到细的协同框架，通用VLM作为扫描器识别感兴趣区域，专用定位器模型输出精确坐标，包含五个阶段和层次化搜索与跨模态通信。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上，扫描器和定位器单独使用时准确率仅为2.0%和3.7%，但集成在GMS框架中达到35.7%的准确率，显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GMS框架有效结合了通用模型和专用模型的优势，展现了在通用GUI定位任务中的鲁棒性和潜力。

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Abstract: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing
socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some
form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at
$411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by
ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning
has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and
achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an
automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale
Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and
ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global
benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability,
we integrate the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
technique to generate visual explanations highlighting disease-specific
regions, thereby fostering clinician trust and reliability in AI-assisted
diagnostics.

TL;DR: AI面部美感预测存在种族偏见，即使使用平衡数据集训练的模型也会在不同种族群体间产生显著预测差异，揭示了当前AI美感预测方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示AI系统即使从看似平衡的数据源也可能引入偏见，特别是在面部美感预测领域存在种族偏见问题，警告AI在塑造审美标准中的作用。

Method: 使用SCUT-FBP5500和MEBeauty数据集训练模型，通过严格的统计验证（Kruskal-Wallis H检验和事后Dunn分析），在平衡的FairFace数据集上进行跨数据集验证。

Result: 两个模型在不同种族群体间都表现出显著预测差异（p < 0.001），交叉验证显示算法放大了社会美感偏见而非缓解，只有4.8-9.5%的组间比较满足分布均衡标准。

Conclusion: 当前AI美感预测方法存在不足，需要采取缓解策略来开发公平的美感技术。

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current
AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons
satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed
and discussed in detail.

Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法虽然采样步骤已减少到一步，但在推理效率方面仍有很大优化空间，需要进一步降低计算成本。

Method: 使用高压缩VAE（空间压缩比16），设计f16 VAE结构，采用像素重排和通道复制进行上采样，并提出下界引导训练策略来稳定训练过程。

Result: FastVSR相比多步模型加速111.9倍，相比现有一步模型加速3.92倍，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: FastVSR通过高压缩VAE和优化的训练策略，在视频超分辨率任务中实现了显著的效率提升，为实时应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

TL;DR: LatXGen是一个生成式框架，能够从背部RGBD图像合成侧位脊柱X光片，实现无辐射的矢状面脊柱对齐评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青少年特发性脊柱侧弯(AIS)需要评估冠状面和矢状面对齐，但现有无辐射方法主要关注冠状面，矢状面评估仍缺乏可靠的无辐射方法。

Method: 采用双阶段架构：首先估计侧位脊柱结构，然后合成相应X光片。引入基于注意力的FFC模块整合解剖特征，以及空间变形网络(SDN)建模侧位形态变化。

Result: 实验结果显示LatXGen生成解剖学准确的X光片，在视觉保真度和定量指标上均优于现有GAN方法。构建了包含3,264对RGBD和侧位X光片的大规模配对数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究为矢状面脊柱评估提供了有前景的无辐射解决方案，推进了AIS的全面评估。

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析面临数据共享的隐私和协议挑战，现有轨迹匹配方法主要关注终端状态，忽略了中间优化状态的关键信息。

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to
privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation
offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,
overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address
this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric
structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy
that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments
on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves
distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model
accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets. Our code is available

TL;DR: DECERN是一种用于细粒度图像分类的主动学习方法，通过结合差异-混淆不确定性和校准多样性来有效评估样本价值，在有限标注预算下选择最具信息量的样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细粒度图像分类中，由于类间差异细微，评估样本的信息量特别具有挑战性。现有方法难以有效感知细粒度图像之间的区分性。

Method: 提出多方面的信息量度量方法，结合差异-混淆不确定性和校准多样性。差异-混淆不确定性量化局部特征融合时的类别方向性和结构稳定性，然后进行不确定性加权聚类来多样化不确定性样本，最后校准多样性以最大化所选样本的全局多样性同时保持局部代表性。

Result: 在7个细粒度图像数据集上的26个不同实验设置中，该方法相比最先进方法取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: DECERN方法能够有效解决细粒度图像分类中样本信息量评估的挑战，在主动学习场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 使用GAN生成肿瘤掩膜，扩散模型生成肿瘤纹理，以放射组学特征作为生成条件。放射组学特征是生物学基础良好的高维手工语义特征。

Conclusion: 该方法允许根据变化的放射组学特征生成各种肿瘤类型，具有在治疗规划中使用多样化合成肿瘤的潜力。

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.
Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the
potential to help with precision medicine.

TL;DR: 提出TaSe框架，通过解构文本表示中的对象、属性和关系，并聚合为层次化结构，显著提升了视觉语言模型对复杂查询的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理包含描述性属性和关系从句的复杂查询时表现有限，主要原因是文本编码器无法有效分离目标对象与其属性和关系。

Method: 提出TaSe框架：1）构建层次化合成字幕数据集；2）Talk in Pieces模块解构文本嵌入为对象、属性和关系三个子空间；3）See in Whole模块学习将解构组件聚合为层次化结构嵌入。

Result: 在OmniLabel基准测试中实现了24%的性能提升，证明了语言组合性的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过引入层次化语言结构归纳偏置，TaSe框架能够生成细粒度的多模态表示，显著提升基于语言的物体检测性能。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钆基对比剂在T1加权MRI中常用于增强病灶可视化，但对有肾源性系统性纤维化风险的患者存在限制，且对比剂使用差异会导致成像不一致。

Method: 提出3D潜在整流流模型，首先将T1w和T2-FLAIR图像输入预训练自编码器获取潜在空间表示，然后在该潜在空间中训练整流流扩散模型。

Result: T1C-RFlow在三个脑肿瘤数据集上表现优于基准模型，实现了最佳肿瘤重建性能，且去噪时间显著更快（6.9秒/体积）。

Conclusion: 该方法生成的合成T1C图像与真实图像高度相似，生成时间远少于传统扩散模型，有望发展成实用的无对比剂脑肿瘤MRI方法。

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding
capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges:
maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to
text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal

MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified
architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a
lightweight adapter, enabling both video understanding and generation. We
introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and
Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe
selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total

Motivation: 视觉基础模型如SAM在大规模自然图像数据集上预训练，但在医学图像分割中表现不佳，需要高效的领域特定适配方法。

Method: 结合三个定制组件：互补细节增强网络(CDEN)捕捉边界敏感特征；Vision Transformer块中的低秩适配器优化医学上下文特征表示；掩码解码器中的低秩张量注意力机制减少内存使用。

Result: 在标准医学分割数据集上，BALR-SAM无需提示即可超越多个SOTA方法，包括全微调的MedSAM，同时仅更新11.7M参数(占总参数1.8%)。

Conclusion: BALR-SAM框架有效解决了医学图像分割中的领域适配问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了资源需求。

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

Motivation: 现有的动态3D人体重建方法要么重建速度慢，要么无法生成新时间表示。需要解决从稀疏视角视频快速重建和插值的问题。

Method: 将4D重建和插值问题简化为流式3D高斯重建和密集运动预测的联合任务。使用可学习状态令牌保持时间一致性，设计运动预测模块预测相邻帧间的密集运动，并通过遮挡感知的高斯融合过程插值任意时间戳的3D高斯。

Result: 在领域内和领域外数据集上的广泛实验证明了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: Forge4D能够高效地从稀疏视角视频重建4D人体，并实现新视角和新时间合成，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

Motivation: 情感视频面部分析领域面临数据稀缺问题，且扩展性对多模态学习的影响尚未充分探索，同时需要捕获模态内和模态间的相关性。

Method: 提出双模态掩码策略，增强模态编码器设计，引入迭代音频-视觉相关性学习模块，以及渐进式语义注入策略，将训练分为三个阶段。

Result: 在17个数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，AVF-MAE++在三个主要AVFA任务中实现了持续的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过创新的组件设计有效解决了AVFA领域的挑战，全面的消融研究验证了每个组件的重要性。

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

Abstract: Despite the promise of foundation models in medical AI, current systems
remain limited - they are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning
processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present
EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify
broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and
testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global
datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties:
dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology.
External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional
datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to
assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with
pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation
for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858)
and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models.
In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across
nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External
validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with
competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training
strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not
only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step
reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early
multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that
could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world
clinical deployment.

Motivation: 从显式动作轨迹生成逼真的机器人视频对于构建有效的世界模型和机器人基础模型至关重要，现有方法通常将动作向量作为被动条件信号，未能充分利用其指导作用。

Method: 1. 动作缩放分类器自由引导：根据动作幅度动态调节引导强度，增强对运动强度的控制；2. 动作缩放噪声截断：调整初始采样噪声分布以更好地与期望运动动态对齐。

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型将视觉信息视为静态前提条件，推理仍局限于语言空间，限制了视觉理解能力

Method: 使用视觉编码器将图像投影到与语言模型共享的联合语义空间中的视觉标记，训练语言模型生成能重构关键视觉标记的潜在状态，实现潜在视觉推理

Result: 在MMVP上达到71.67%的准确率，相比Qwen2.5-VL的66.67%有显著提升

Conclusion: LVR范式通过直接在视觉嵌入空间进行推理，大幅改善了细粒度视觉理解和感知能力

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

Conclusion: CoTAM通过自适应特征保护和多级重建策略，有效解决了MLLMs的压缩需求，为边缘设备到云端的信号传输提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

Conclusion: S²NN通过亚比特权重表示和提出的优化方法，成功实现了SNN的进一步压缩和加速，为边缘计算提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing
applications.

Abstract: Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality
synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge.
In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion
models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image
realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency
between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints,
enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a
combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and
PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image
quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,

Motivation: 现实世界点云常受传感器限制、环境噪声和预处理误差影响，导致密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形，现有配准方法对这些干扰敏感，配准精度降低。

Method: 将骨架结构整合到配准过程中，结合从受损点云对齐和其骨架对齐获得的变换来实现最优配准，并设计了分布距离损失函数来强制源骨架和目标骨架之间的一致性。

Result: 在多种受损数据集上的实验评估表明，SRRF在各种干扰场景下（包括密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形）始终优于最先进的配准方法。

Conclusion: SRRF在处理受损点云方面具有鲁棒性，使其成为现实场景中3D感知任务的潜在方法。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging

Conclusion: ASIA框架通过少量图像标注实现了高质量的3D分割，克服了传统方法的局限性，在分割精度和实用性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and

TL;DR: FrameThinker是一个用于长视频推理的新框架，通过迭代式询问视频内容，让大型视觉语言模型能够高效处理长视频任务，大幅减少处理帧数同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在长视频理解中存在均匀帧采样和静态文本推理的问题，效率低下且难以处理视觉密集型视频任务。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略：首先使用监督微调建立基础动作能力，然后通过强化学习优化决策策略，并对每个动作和格式奖励进行深入设计探索。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，FrameThinker相比基线平均提升10.4%，同时大幅减少处理帧数。7B模型在LongVideo-Reason上达到76.1%准确率，仅使用20.6帧，优于LongVILA-R1且帧数减少20倍以上。

Conclusion: FrameThinker框架在长视频推理中实现了高效性和有效性的平衡，为处理视觉密集型长视频任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMeGa是一个端到端框架，联合优化显式三角网格和2D高斯泼溅，通过灵活的绑定策略解决室内无纹理区域几何重建不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在无纹理室内区域存在几何不准确的问题，且网格提取与优化过程分离，无法利用网格几何指导泼溅优化。

Method: 使用绑定策略将高斯泼溅的空间属性表达在网格框架中，保留纹理属性在泼溅上；集成网格约束和单目法线监督；提出启发式迭代网格细化策略。

Result: 在具有挑战性的室内重建基准测试中达到最先进性能，比2DGS基线减少Chamfer-L1 47.3%，同时保持竞争力的新视角渲染质量。

Conclusion: OMeGa有效解决了先前室内无纹理重建中的局限性，实现了更准确的几何重建。

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜断层扫描（cryo-ET）能够原位可视化大分子结构，但子断层图分析面临注释稀缺、噪声严重和泛化能力差等挑战，需要开发基础模型来解决这些问题。

Method: 1）CryoEngine：生成超过904k个子断层图的大规模合成数据生成器；2）APT-ViT：结合自适应相位标记的视觉变换器，增强对几何和语义变化的鲁棒性；3）NRCL：噪声鲁棒对比学习策略，在严重噪声条件下稳定表示学习。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了冷冻电镜断层扫描中子断层图分析的可扩展性和鲁棒性，为基础模型在该领域的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征度量方法可能遗漏复杂的互相关关系，而相关度量方法因处理4D相关图而计算成本高昂。需要一种能克服这些限制的高效方法。

Method: 使用选择性状态空间模型，采用源自Mamba线性复杂度算法的相似性感知选择性扫描机制，在不牺牲特征图分辨率或感受野的情况下有效优化4D相关图。

Result: 在标准语义对应基准测试中，MambaMatcher实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MambaMatcher通过选择性状态空间模型成功克服了传统方法的局限性，为语义对应任务提供了一种高效且性能优异的解决方案。

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet
challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance
visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while
recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs
due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel
method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling
high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By
implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's
linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map
effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field.
Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that
MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于三平面融合的多视角鸡只计数模型TP-MVCC，通过几何投影和三平面融合整合多摄像头特征到统一地面平面，在密集遮挡场景下实现95.1%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能农业中精确动物计数至关重要，但在拥挤场景中由于遮挡和有限摄像头视角而难以实现。

Method: 使用三平面融合的多视角鸡只计数框架，提取单视角特征，通过空间变换对齐，解码场景级密度图进行精确计数。

Result: TP-MVCC显著优于单视角和传统融合方法，在密集遮挡场景下达到95.1%准确率，展现强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在智能农业中具有实际应用潜力，特别是在密集遮挡场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult
in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this,
we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which
leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from
multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts
single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a
scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct
the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions.
Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and
conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong
robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential
for intelligent agriculture.

*Guolin Ke,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SphereAR通过将AR模型的输入输出约束在固定半径的超球面上，解决了自回归图像生成中的方差崩溃问题，在ImageNet生成上达到了AR模型的新SOTA（FID 1.34）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续token自回归模型在图像生成中往往落后于潜在扩散和掩码生成模型，主要问题是VAE潜在空间中的异质方差在AR解码过程中被放大，导致方差崩溃。

Method: 提出SphereAR方法，将所有AR输入输出（包括CFG后）约束在固定半径的超球面上，利用超球面VAE去除尺度分量，稳定AR解码。

Result: SphereAR-H（943M）在ImageNet生成上达到FID 1.34，创AR模型新记录；较小规模的SphereAR-L（479M）和SphereAR-B（208M）分别达到FID 1.54和1.92，超越或匹配更大的基线模型。

Conclusion: 这是首个在可比参数量下，纯next-token自回归图像生成器（光栅顺序）超越扩散和掩码生成模型的工作。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自反思自改进的多智能体框架，用于解决农业视觉问答中多图像输入和外部知识不足的问题，在AgMMU基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有农业视觉问答方法主要针对文本查询或单图像场景，无法处理需要多图像互补视角和生长阶段信息的真实农业场景，且缺乏对外部农业知识的有效利用和系统质量控制。

Method: 采用四角色多智能体框架：检索器负责获取外部信息，反思器评估充分性并触发重新检索，两个回答器并行生成候选答案以减少偏差，改进器通过迭代检查优化答案并确保多图像信息有效对齐。

Result: 在AgMMU基准测试中，该框架在多图像农业问答任务上取得了有竞争力的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该自反思自改进的多智能体框架能够有效处理农业场景中的多图像输入和知识不完整问题，通过协作机制实现了上下文增强、反思推理和迭代改进。

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRV-Diffusion是一个隐式潜在视频扩散模型，通过生成神经网络权重来合成视频。该模型将视频压缩并生成为一个统一的神经网络，避免了传统方法中的帧间注意力机制，实现了高效高质量的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频生成方法通常将视频编码为逐帧的特征图，存在效率问题。作者希望通过将视频表示为统一的神经网络参数，实现更高效和高质量的视频合成。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）基于超网络的标记器将原始视频从像素空间编码到神经参数空间；2）隐式扩散变换器在潜在INR权重上进行去噪。通过重用瓶颈潜在和重新设计权重分配、上采样连接和输入坐标，实现高斯分布的INR权重。

Result: 在UCF-101和Kinetics-600等真实世界视频基准测试中，NeRV-Diffusion达到了优于先前基于INR的模型的视频生成质量，并与最新的非隐式模型性能相当。同时提供了平滑的INR权重空间，便于帧间或视频间的无缝插值。

Conclusion: NeRV-Diffusion通过将视频表示为神经网络权重，实现了高效高质量的视频生成，在多个基准测试中表现出色，并为视频插值提供了便利。

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的多器官分割方法存在计算成本高和局部细节信息提取不足的问题，需要设计更高效的网络结构。

Method: 提出U形网络LamFormer，使用线性注意力Mamba模块捕获多尺度长程依赖，构建并行层次特征聚合模块整合不同层特征，设计降维Transformer全局建模上采样特征。

Result: 在7个复杂多样的数据集上优于现有分割方法，在模型性能和复杂度之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: LamFormer通过创新的模块设计有效解决了Transformer在医学图像分割中的计算效率和局部细节提取问题，展现出卓越的分割性能。

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

TL;DR: 提出了DRIFT防御方法，通过训练随机滤波器集成来破坏梯度共识，从而对抗对抗性攻击的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对对抗性样本高度脆弱，现有防御在梯度可估计时容易失效。研究发现梯度共识是攻击迁移性的关键驱动因素。

Method: 引入DRIFT方法，训练轻量级可学习滤波器集成，通过最大化雅可比矩阵和logit空间的响应分歧来强制梯度不协调，同时保持自然预测准确性。

Result: 在ImageNet上对CNN和Vision Transformer都实现了显著的鲁棒性提升，在自适应白盒攻击、迁移攻击和无梯度攻击下优于现有最先进防御方法。

Conclusion: DRIFT以可忽略的运行时间和内存成本实现了鲁棒性改进，确立了梯度分歧作为对抗性防御的实用和可泛化原则。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to
yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability.
Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain
effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent
Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight,
learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior
randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces
\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and
logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions
are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical
analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a
consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency,
Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and
(iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet
across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art
preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under
adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers
these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing
gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial
defense.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于共享自回归变换器的统一多模态模型存在严重梯度冲突问题，特别是在浅层和深层，这是由于图像和文本在低层统计特性上的根本差异导致的。

Method: 采用两端分离、中间共享的X形架构：初始和最终层用于模态特定处理，中间层保持共享参数进行高级语义融合，消除两端的梯度冲突并缓解共享层的残余冲突。

Result: 在相同训练条件下，Uni-X实现了优越的训练效率；当扩展到3B参数时，其性能匹配或超越7B基于AR的UMMs，在图像生成任务中获得82的GenEval分数，同时在文本和视觉理解任务中表现强劲。

Conclusion: Uni-X为未来统一多模态建模提供了一个参数高效且可扩展的基础架构，有效解决了多模态训练中的梯度冲突问题。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出R²M框架，通过模型融合解决深度伪造检测问题，无需重新训练即可适应新的伪造生成器


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造生成器快速进化，使得数据收集和重复训练变得不切实际。模型融合是深度伪造检测的自然解决方案，因为不同伪造检测专家共享相同的二元决策，仅在生成器特定伪影上有所不同

Method: 提出Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R²M)框架：通过任务向量的低秩分解估计共享的Real组件，将每个专家分解为Real对齐部分和Fake残差，通过层级秩截断对残差去噪，并使用每任务范数匹配进行聚合以防止单一生成器主导

Result: 在分布内、跨数据集和未见数据集上，R²M优于联合训练和其他融合基线方法。R²M具有可组合性，当新伪造家族出现时，只需微调一个专家并重新融合，无需重新训练

Conclusion: R²M提供了一种训练自由的参数空间融合框架，能够有效适应深度伪造检测的快速演变，通过共享Real组件和残差分解实现了优越的性能和可扩展性

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

Conclusion: DINOReg通过充分利用视觉和几何信息，在点云配准任务中取得了显著改进，证明了视觉基础模型在3D计算机视觉任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于掩码聚类的标注引擎（MCAE），通过将语义一致的掩码组作为最小标注单元，显著提高了亚米级遥感图像的标注效率，并构建了包含约140亿标注像素的高质量土地覆盖数据集HiCity-LC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亚米级分辨率遥感图像提供了精细的土地覆盖分析细节，但由于缺乏高质量标注数据集，其在大规模土地覆盖制图方面的潜力未能充分发挥。现有标注方法通常不可靠或成本过高。

Method: 基于空间自相关原理，提出MCAE方法，将语义一致的掩码组作为最小标注单元，实现多个实例的同时高效标注。

Result: MCAE将标注效率提高了1-2个数量级，同时保持了标签质量、语义多样性和空间代表性。构建的HiCity-LC数据集支持在五个中国主要城市生成准确率超过85%的城市级土地覆盖图。

Conclusion: HiCity-LC是首个公开可用的亚米级分辨率城市级土地覆盖基准数据集，证明了MCAE在大规模亚米级分辨率制图中的可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REALIGN是一个基于正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输的自监督框架，用于处理程序视频学习中的背景片段、重复动作和非单调步骤顺序问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的教学视频包含背景片段、重复动作和乱序步骤，这违反了传统对齐方法的强单调性假设。现有方法仅依赖特征相似性，无法捕捉任务的高阶时间结构。

Method: 使用正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输(R-FPGWOT)联合建模视觉对应关系和时间关系，结合序列间对比学习稳定训练。

Result: 在EgoProceL、ProceL和CrossTask基准测试中，REALIGN实现了高达18.9%的平均F1分数提升和超过30%的时间IoU增益，并产生更可解释的传输映射。

Conclusion: REALIGN能够有效处理程序视频中的噪声和乱序问题，在保持关键步骤顺序的同时过滤噪声，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

Motivation: 现有3D多模态大语言模型依赖3D数据输入，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力，需要开发不依赖外部3D数据的实用解决方案。

Method: 使用视频输入替代3D数据，设计交叉任务适配器对齐3D几何先验与视觉语言表示，引入度量深度模型恢复真实尺度几何，采用两阶段蒸馏优化策略进行微调。

Result: 在3D问答、3D密集描述和3D视觉定位等多个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，展示了优越的多任务能力。

Conclusion: Vid-LLM通过视频输入有效解决了3D场景理解问题，无需外部3D数据，具有更好的实用性和部署可行性。

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了PCICF框架，用于系统识别和分类弱势道路使用者（VRU）情境，支持自动驾驶出租车在运营设计域（ODD）内的事故分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶出租车在各国商业化部署，需要在特定运营设计域内可靠检测弱势道路使用者（如行人、自行车骑手等）。端到端AI系统需要高质量数据来训练和评估，但目前缺乏系统化的情境分类方法。

Method: 基于现有SMIRK合成数据集扩展为MoreSMIRK数据集，构建多行人穿越情境的结构化字典。使用空间填充曲线（SFCs）将多维场景特征转换为特征模式，并与MoreSMIRK中的条目进行匹配。

Result: 在包含150多个手动标注行人穿越视频的PIE真实世界数据集上评估，PCICF能够成功识别和分类复杂的行人穿越情境，即使行人群体合并或分离时也能有效处理。

Conclusion: PCICF框架通过计算高效的组件（如SFCs）具有在自动驾驶出租车上进行ODD检测的潜力，为系统化训练和评估端到端AI系统提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

Motivation: 从文本提示生成合成多视图图像是创建合成3D资产的重要桥梁，需要提高生成速度和视图一致性

Method: 提出新颖的时空角度潜在空间，将空间外观和角度视图偏差编码到单一潜在空间中，并采用多步骤训练策略

Result: RapidMV在一致性和延迟方面优于现有方法，质量和文本-图像对齐具有竞争力

Conclusion: RapidMV实现了快速高效的多视图图像生成，为3D资产创建提供了重要工具

Abstract: Generating synthetic multi-view images from a text prompt is an essential
bridge to generating synthetic 3D assets. In this work, we introduce RapidMV, a
novel text-to-multi-view generative model that can produce 32 multi-view
synthetic images in just around 5 seconds. In essence, we propose a novel
spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular
viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and
multi-view consistency. We achieve effective training of RapidMV by
strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We
demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency
and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLQ是一种针对扩散变换器(DiTs)的跨层引导正交量化方法，通过交叉块校准、正交平滑和跨层参数搜索三个关键技术，在W4A4量化下实现几乎无损的视觉生成质量，同时获得3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在视觉生成质量方面取得显著进展，但模型规模和复杂度的增加阻碍了其在边缘设备上的实际部署。模型后训练量化(PTQ)虽然能减少内存消耗和加速推理，但会带来性能下降。

Method: 1. 交叉块校准(CBC)：获取准确的校准数据以更好地指导量化；2. 正交平滑(OBS)：量化每个通道的异常值分数，利用块Hadamard矩阵平滑异常值；3. 跨层参数搜索(CLPS)：搜索最优参数配置。

Result: 在图像生成和视频生成模型上评估CLQ，成功将模型压缩为W4A4格式，视觉质量和指标仅有可忽略的下降，实现了3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速。

Conclusion: CLQ方法有效解决了扩散变换器量化中的性能下降问题，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案，在保持高质量视觉生成的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our
code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 随着模型架构成熟，数据质量成为关键因素，但图像领域缺乏系统性的数据集质量评估研究。

Method: 使用CIFAKE数据集分析常见质量问题，结合CleanVision和Fastdup工具开发增强流程，引入自动阈值选择机制。

Result: 自动阈值方法将单扰动下的F1分数从0.6794提升到0.9468，双扰动下从0.7447提升到0.8557，去重策略将F1分数从0.4576提升到0.7928。

Conclusion: 卷积神经网络对模糊和严重下采样等遮蔽关键视觉特征的退化特别敏感，提出的工作流程有效提升了图像数据质量评估效果。

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

TL;DR: Proxy-GS是一种新颖的3D高斯泼溅方法，通过引入代理系统实现遮挡感知，在提升渲染质量的同时加速渲染速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅方法虽然高效，但缺乏遮挡感知能力，导致渲染时存在大量冗余计算。MLP变体虽然提升了视觉保真度，但带来了显著的解码开销。

Method: 提出Proxy-GS管道，使用快速代理系统在1ms内生成1000x1000分辨率的精确遮挡深度图。该代理系统指导锚点和高斯函数的剔除以加速渲染，并在训练期间引导向表面的致密化。

Result: 在MatrixCity Streets等遮挡严重场景中，Proxy-GS不仅增强了基于MLP的高斯泼溅的渲染能力，还实现了更快的渲染速度，比Octree-GS加速超过2.5倍，同时提供显著更高的渲染质量。

Conclusion: Proxy-GS通过引入遮挡感知代理系统，有效解决了3D高斯泼溅中的冗余问题，在保持高质量渲染的同时大幅提升了渲染效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

Motivation: 解决现有方法仅从外观相似性隐式学习光流估计的问题，以及模态差异和几何不对齐的挑战。

Method: 采用解耦优化策略，协同训练模态转换网络和光流估计网络；提出几何感知数据合成流水线和异常值鲁棒损失；引入跨模态一致性约束联合优化两个网络。

Result: 在构建的综合跨模态光流基准上，DCFlow可与多种光流估计网络集成，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DCFlow通过解耦优化和跨模态一致性约束，有效解决了跨模态光流估计中的模态差异和几何不对齐问题，实现了优异的无监督性能。

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成评估主要关注视频质量和时间一致性，但忽视了模型对输入图像特定主题语义理解能力以及生成视频是否符合物理规律和人类常识的问题。

Method: 设计了四个主要评估维度：空间理解、属性绑定、类别理解和推理；基于多模态大语言模型开发了两种评估方法：实例级细粒度语义理解管道和基于反馈的推理管道；包含约500个精心构建的文本-图像对。

Conclusion: UI2V-Bench填补了图像到视频生成评估在语义理解和推理能力方面的关键空白，为该领域未来研究和模型开发提供了稳健的框架和数据集。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

Conclusion: NeoWorld框架成功实现了从单张图像生成交互式3D虚拟世界，通过渐进式细节展开机制提供高效且真实的虚拟环境探索体验。

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

Motivation: 传统视频问答模型的监督信号局限于孤立的事实问答对，无法捕捉视频的叙事和因果结构，限制了模型对视频内容的深度理解。

Method: 提出两种互补策略：问题转述(QBP)将现有问答对合成为重建视频事件结构的叙事段落；问题字幕(QBC)为每个问题生成细粒度的视觉推理，将答案与具体证据关联。利用生成模型合成数据，在统一的下一个词预测目标下训练视频问答模型。

Conclusion: 将数据合成从孤立事实转向叙事连贯性和基于证据的推理，能够产生更准确、高效和可泛化的训练范式。

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

Method: 使用知识蒸馏的双模型集成：教师模型和两个学生模型（编码器-解码器模型用于工业异常检测，编码器-编码器模型用于语义异常检测），共享DINOv2预训练编码器，通过Noisy-OR目标联合学习

Result: 在8个公开基准测试中均取得SOTA：MVTec-AD图像级AUROC达99.7%，CIFAR-10达97.8%，在多类和单类设置下均优于现有通用模型和专用模型

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了跨多个异常检测领域的泛化，在工业检测和语义异常检测任务上均表现出色，为通用异常检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到运动生成方法在实现细粒度表现力运动控制方面存在挑战，主要由于数据集缺乏运动风格多样性以及难以用自然语言表达定量特征。Laban运动分析被舞蹈专家广泛用于尽可能一致地表达运动细节。

Method: 提出零样本推理时优化方法，将Laban Effort和Shape组件的量化方法无缝集成到文本引导的运动生成模型中，通过在采样步骤更新预训练扩散模型的文本嵌入来指导生成具有所需Laban组件的运动，无需额外运动数据。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法实现了可解释和富有表现力的人体运动生成控制，展示了在保持运动身份的同时操纵运动属性的能力。

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

Motivation: 空间智能是多模态大语言模型尚未解决的关键挑战，包括形状可视化、物体旋转、位置关系判断和数量估计等能力

Method: 构建包含3万道平面和立体几何问题的Euclid30K数据集，使用Group Relative Policy Optimization微调Qwen2.5VL和RoboBrain2.0系列模型，让模型学习识别形状、计数、关联实体并进行多步演绎推理

Result: 训练后的模型在四个空间推理基准测试中实现显著零样本性能提升，VSI-Bench平均准确率从34.5%提升至40.5%，RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B达到49.6%准确率，超越之前的SOTA模型

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究表明以几何为中心的微调可以为视觉语言模型提供广泛可迁移的空间技能

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and
Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

Motivation: 时尚产业是废物和排放的主要贡献者，促进二手市场发展需要大规模评估二手服装价值，而机器学习方法在扩展二手市场平台中发挥重要作用。

Method: 采用聚类和核心集选择方法识别代表性样本，捕获服装关键特征和内部变异性；引入基于邻域同质性一致性得分的异常值去除方法，在筛选前过滤非典型样本。

Result: 在DeepFashion Attribute、DeepFashion Con2Shop和DeepFashion2三个公开数据集上评估，系统在保持接近最优精度的同时，通过减少向量数据库中的图像数量显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在性能和效率之间实现了良好权衡，异常值去除方法应用于聚类技术可进一步提高检索性能，通过去除非判别性样本来优化选择过程。

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了语义课程偏好优化(SCPO)框架，通过渐进式课程学习、动态参考模型和双向目标函数，有效缓解多模态大语言模型的视觉幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在严重的视觉幻觉问题，即生成响应与视觉证据相矛盾。现有的直接偏好优化方法难以捕捉细粒度语义差异并容易导致捷径学习。

Method: SCPO框架包含三个关键组件：基于语义课程偏好数据集的渐进式课程、动态参考模型、以及对称双向目标函数，同时学习文本和视觉偏好。

Result: 在LLaVA模型上的广泛实验表明，SCPO在多个幻觉基准测试中表现优于基线模型，幻觉率降低高达62.9%，同时在通用基准测试中保持性能稳定。

Conclusion: SCPO是首个统一语义、对称性和课程学习的MLLM对齐框架，能有效缓解视觉幻觉，提高事实性，同时保持通用能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法存在模态依赖不平衡问题，当主导模态在真实场景中退化时整体性能显著下降，模态平衡成为实际多模态分割的关键挑战。

Method: 提出EQUISeg框架，基于四阶段跨模态Transformer块实现模态均衡编码，设计自引导模块通过相互引导机制自适应调整模态贡献。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EQUISeg实现了显著的性能提升，有效缓解了分割任务中模态不平衡的不利影响。

Conclusion: EQUISeg通过均衡模态编码和自引导机制，成功解决了多模态分割中的模态不平衡问题，提升了模型在退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准CLIP文本编码器在复杂多对象场景中的图像编辑经常失败，需要解决对象数量、空间布局约束和多样类别的挑战。

Method: QL-Adapter包含两个核心模块：图像-布局融合模块（ILFM）将布局先验与CLIP图像编码器的ViT补丁标记融合以增强空间结构理解；跨模态增强模块（CMAM）将图像特征注入文本分支以丰富文本嵌入和改进指令跟随。

Result: 在QL-Edit任务上的广泛实验表明，QL-Adapter实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: QL-Adapter通过融合布局先验和跨模态增强，有效解决了复杂场景中多对象编辑的挑战，在数量和布局一致的图像编辑任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Consistency Mid-Training (CMT)方法，在扩散预训练和流映射训练之间插入轻量级中间阶段，显著提升训练稳定性和效率，在多个数据集上实现最先进的少步生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流映射模型如一致性模型和均值流的训练存在不稳定、对超参数敏感且成本高的问题，即使从预训练扩散模型初始化，仍需要将无限小步转换为长跳映射，稳定性问题未解决。

Method: 引入中间训练概念，在预训练和最终流映射训练之间插入轻量级阶段。CMT训练模型将预训练模型求解器轨迹上的点直接映射到求解器生成的干净样本，获得轨迹一致且稳定的初始化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上实现2步FID 1.97，ImageNet 64x64上1.32，ImageNet 512x512上1.84，相比一致性模型节省高达98%的训练数据和GPU时间。在ImageNet 256x256上达到1步FID 3.34，相比从头训练的均值流减少约50%训练时间。

Conclusion: CMT为训练流映射模型提供了一个原则性、高效且通用的框架，显著提升了训练稳定性和效率。

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 理论分析表明Diffusion Bridge具有更低的成本函数和更稳定的轨迹；Flow Matching在小训练数据集下插值系数效果下降。实验在图像修复、超分辨率、去模糊、去噪、转换和风格迁移等任务中验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: Diffusion Bridge在轨迹稳定性和自然性方面更优，而Flow Matching在小训练数据集下表现较差；两种方法各有优缺点，应根据具体任务和数据规模选择合适的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion
Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with
the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various
experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting,
Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks,
systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different
difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align
perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the
respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DBFM-3E8E/.

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

Motivation: 现有后门攻击使用固定目标模式，容易被检测到，因为模型会记住这些频繁模式并表现出过度自信。需要开发更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 在训练时向选定样本注入视觉触发器，同时交换对应文本回答中关键标记的语法角色，使用自适应标记加权损失来强调交换标记的学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试和各种LVLM架构上，TokenSwap实现了高攻击成功率，同时保持了优越的隐蔽性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: TokenSwap证明了针对LVLM组合理解能力的后门攻击的有效性，相比固定模式攻击具有更好的隐蔽性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

*Peter Hönig,Stefan Thalhammer,Jean-Baptiste Weibel,Matthias Hirschmanner,Markus Vincze*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE是一个基于扩散模型的类别级物体姿态估计方法，使用DINOv2特征作为连续语义先验，无需离散类别标签，在合成训练和未知类别物体上均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在开放环境中遇到未知物体时的姿态估计问题，需要语义理解能力来泛化到已知类别及之外的物体。

Method: 结合DINOv2特征作为连续语义先验，使用照片级真实训练数据和点法线噪声模型，通过交叉注意力注入语义先验，学习跨物体实例的规范化坐标系。

Result: 在合成训练的类别级物体姿态估计中比现有技术提升31.9%（5°5cm指标），在两个实例级数据集上展示了对未知类别的泛化能力，抓取成功率最高达100%。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过连续语义先验有效缩小了Sim2Real差距，能够泛化到已知类别之外的物体，为开放环境中的物体操作提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

Motivation: 构建联合面部-颅骨可变形模型在远程诊断、手术规划、医学教育和基于物理的面部模拟等方面具有巨大潜力，但受到配对数据稀缺、配准精度不足以及临床应用探索有限的限制。

Method: 首先构建了包含200多个样本的数据集，包括正常病例和罕见颅面畸形病例；其次提出了密集射线匹配配准方法确保拓扑一致性；最后引入了3D双向面部-颅骨可变形模型（BFSM），通过共享系数空间实现面部-颅骨形状推断，并建模组织厚度变化。

Conclusion: 提出的BFSM模型有效解决了面部-颅骨建模中的关键挑战，为医疗应用提供了可靠的工具，特别是在颅面畸形患者的代表性不足问题上有所改进。

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文评估了YOLOv11模型在血液涂片细胞检测中的性能，创建了一个包含16,891张图像和298,850个标注细胞的大规模数据集，发现YOLOv11 Medium变体在准确性和计算效率之间达到最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动外周血涂片分析劳动密集且主观性强，深度学习提供了有前景的替代方案，但缺乏对YOLOv11等最先进模型在精细PBS检测中的系统评估。

Method: 创建大规模标注数据集，包含12种外周血细胞类别和红细胞类别；对五种YOLOv11变体进行综合评估，使用两种数据分割策略（70:20:10和80:10:10），采用mAP、精确率、召回率、F1分数和计算效率等多重性能标准。

Result: YOLOv11 Medium变体在8:1:1分割下达到mAP@0.5为0.934的最佳平衡；大型模型（Large和XLarge）仅带来边际精度提升但计算成本显著增加；8:1:1分割在所有模型中始终优于7:2:1分割。

Conclusion: YOLOv11，特别是Medium变体，是自动化精细PBS检测的高效框架；公开发布的数据集为血液学中血细胞检测和分类研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构化最优传输的无监督框架，用于精英标枪投掷运动中的上下文感知时序分割，无需手动标注即可识别运动阶段转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运动分析方法依赖手动标注或实验室设备，耗时昂贵且缺乏可扩展性。需要一种自动提取相关动力学变量的鲁棒方法。

Method: 使用结构化最优传输(SOT)概念增强注意力时空图卷积网络(ASTGCN)，实现无监督的上下文感知时序分割。

Result: 在测试数据上达到71.02%的平均精度和74.61%的F1分数，显著优于现有无监督方法。发布了包含211个专业标枪投掷视频的新数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为运动分析提供了一种可扩展的无监督解决方案，在标枪投掷分析中表现出色。

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

*Yuhan Zhu,Xiangyu Zeng,Chenting Wang,Xinhao Li,Yicheng Xu,Ziang Yan,Yi Wang,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeRet是一个即插即用的框架，可将任何多模态大语言模型转化为两阶段检索器，无需额外训练即可实现强大的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型需要大量后训练才能转化为对比编码器进行检索，这限制了它们的通用性和效率。

Method: FreeRet采用两阶段方法：首先直接从模型获取语义嵌入进行快速候选搜索，然后利用模型的推理能力进行精确重排序。框架包含三个关键技术：绕过词汇对齐层获取语义忠实嵌入、使用显式先验条件生成表示、通过中性选择框架减轻重排序中的框架效应。

Result: 在涵盖46个数据集的MMEB和MMEB-V2基准测试中，FreeRet显著优于经过数百万对数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 预训练的多模态大语言模型经过精心利用，可以作为强大的检索引擎而无需训练，填补了其作为通用模型角色的关键空白。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPLICE是一个基于COIN教学视频数据集的人类标注基准，用于评估事件推理能力。该基准包含3,381个视频和11,423个事件片段，测试人类和视觉语言模型重新排列片段为连贯序列的能力。结果显示VLMs与人类表现存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉语言模型在多维度事件推理（时间、因果、空间、上下文和常识）方面的能力，并与人类表现进行对比。

Method: 从COIN数据集构建SPLICE基准，包含12个类别180个子类别的3,381个视频和11,423个事件片段。通过重新排列事件片段的任务评估人类和VLMs的推理能力。

Result: VLMs表现显著低于人类，即使使用人类标注的文本描述也只能有限提升模型准确率。VLMs在时间和因果推理主导的视频中表现相对较好，但在上下文和空间推理主导的视频中表现较差。

Conclusion: VLMs在视觉推理方面仍面临持续挑战，过度依赖语言先验而非视觉理解，在复杂推理任务中无法达到人类水平。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显示屏照片中常见的闪烁条纹严重影响可读性和感知质量，但相比莫尔条纹，该问题研究不足且缺乏专用解决方案。

Method: 提出RIFLE扩散框架，包含闪烁条纹先验估计器(FPE)预测关键条纹属性，使用掩码损失(ML)聚焦监督条纹区域，并开发了模拟管道合成真实FB数据。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上，RIFLE在定量指标和视觉比较中始终优于现有图像重建基线，从轻微到严重闪烁条纹都能有效处理。

Conclusion: 本研究为后续FB研究奠定了数据集构建和去除模型设计的良好基础，是首个专门研究FB模拟和去除的工作。

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 建立了一个通用且可扩展的面向对象生成建模方法，通过连接人类对象感知和机器学习，扩展了交互式、结构化和用户驱动生成工具的设计空间。

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

Conclusion: 针对性的分类增强为推进伪装物体分割性能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing
camouflaged object segmentation performance.

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without
visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking
among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python
implementation of our pipeline is publicly available.

TL;DR: SANA-Video是一个小型扩散模型，能够高效生成720x1280分辨率、分钟级时长的视频，具有快速推理速度，可在RTX 5090 GPU上部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频生成模型计算成本高、推理速度慢的问题，实现低成本、高质量的视频生成。

Method: 采用线性注意力机制(Linear DiT)和恒定内存KV缓存技术，结合有效的数据过滤和训练策略。

Result: 在64个H100 GPU上仅需12天训练成本(仅为MovieGen的1%)，生成速度比现有模型快16倍，在RTX 5090上推理速度提升2.4倍。

Conclusion: SANA-Video实现了低成本、高质量的视频生成，在性能和效率方面具有竞争优势。

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B

*Yutong Hao,Chen Chen,Ajmal Saeed Mian,Chang Xu,Daochang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过显式推理物理不合理性来改进扩散模型生成视频的物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型隐式学习物理推理，成本高、难以扩展，且容易产生违反物理定律的不合理运动。

Method: 使用轻量级物理感知推理管道构建反事实提示，提出同步解耦引导策略（SDG），包括同步方向归一化对抗滞后抑制和轨迹解耦去噪缓解累积轨迹偏差。

Result: 在不同物理领域的实验中，该方法显著提高了物理保真度，同时保持照片真实感，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 建立了一种新的即插即用物理感知视频生成范式。

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

TL;DR: 提出了IWR-Bench基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型从视频重建交互式网页的能力，包含113个真实网站任务，测试结果显示现有模型在功能正确性方面表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注静态截图到代码的任务，忽略了真实网页应用中的动态交互特性，需要新的基准来评估模型对交互逻辑的理解能力。

Method: 构建包含113个任务的基准测试，涵盖100个真实网站，包含用户交互视频和静态资源，使用代理作为评判框架自动评估生成网页的功能正确性和视觉保真度。

Result: 在28个大型视觉语言模型上的实验显示，最佳模型总体得分仅为36.35%，功能正确性得分(24.39%)远低于视觉保真度得分(64.25%)。

Conclusion: 当前模型在理解时间动态性和合成事件驱动逻辑方面存在严重局限，IWR-Bench为视觉语言研究设立了具有挑战性的前沿基准。

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is
available at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文评估了偏振成像在改善水面漂浮碎片分割方面的效果，发现偏振线索能提高低对比度物体的检测并抑制反射导致的误报，但会增加计算负担和新的误报风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水面漂浮碎片的准确分割常受到水面眩光和室外光照变化的影响，偏振成像提供了一种单传感器方法来减轻水面眩光对语义分割的干扰。

Method: 在PoTATO数据集上对最先进的融合网络进行基准测试，并与使用传统模型的单图像基线进行比较。

Result: 偏振线索有助于恢复低对比度物体并抑制反射引起的误报，相对于RGB输入提高了平均IoU并降低了轮廓误差。

Conclusion: 偏振相机能提供更清晰的分割掩码，但会增大模型计算负载并引入新的误报风险，需要权衡利弊选择是否适合特定应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

Method: 构建了包含156万对CT-PET图像和2757份越南语临床报告的大规模多模态医学数据集，并设计了包含数据增强和专家验证测试集的训练框架，在医疗报告生成和视觉问答等下游任务上对现有视觉语言模型进行基准测试。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试为推进医学成像领域更鲁棒的视觉语言模型发展，特别是在低资源语言环境中的临床应用，迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的三模态（RGB、深度、热红外）目标跟踪任务，构建了RGBDT500数据集，并开发了RDTTrack跟踪器，通过正交投影约束和多模态提示学习显著提升了复杂场景下的跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态跟踪方法主要关注双模态（如RGB-D或RGB-T），在复杂场景中因输入模态有限而面临挑战。为了填补这一空白，本研究引入三模态互补跟踪来增强鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了RDTTrack跟踪器，利用预训练的RGB跟踪模型和提示学习技术。通过正交投影约束融合热红外和深度模态，然后将其与RGB信号作为提示集成到基础跟踪模型中，有效协调三模态互补线索。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在复杂场景下的跟踪精度和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有的双模态方法。

Conclusion: 三模态跟踪方法通过互补模态融合和提示学习技术，在复杂场景中实现了更鲁棒和准确的目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

TL;DR: ExGS是一个新颖的前馈框架，通过统一通用高斯压缩(UGC)和GaussPainter，实现极端3D高斯溅射压缩，在100倍压缩下仍能保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经场景表示(如3DGS)存储和传输成本高，现有压缩方法要么优化成本高，要么在高压缩比下会降低渲染质量。

Method: UGC执行无重新优化的剪枝来减少高斯基元，GaussPainter利用扩散先验和掩码引导细化来从严重剪枝的高斯场景中恢复高质量渲染。

Result: 框架可实现超过100倍压缩(从354.77MB压缩到约3.31MB)，同时保持保真度并在挑战性条件下显著改善图像质量。

Conclusion: 扩散先验在弥合极端压缩和高质量神经渲染之间的差距中发挥核心作用。

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at
\href{https://github.com/chenttt2001/ExGS}{here}.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在将推理基于感知证据方面存在困难，需要系统研究不同感知策略的效果

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段进行感知增强微调，第二阶段应用具有视觉、文本和一致性奖励的感知感知强化学习

Result: VTPerception-R1在多个基准测试中显著提高了推理准确性和鲁棒性，特别是对小模型效果更明显

Conclusion: 显式感知（特别是与文本线索结合）效果最佳，VTPerception-R1为感知基础的多模态推理提供了可扩展且可审计的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning
in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception
strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal
benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception,
especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples
perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning,
and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual,
textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1
significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks,
offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal
reasoning. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决现有大型视频语言模型在长视频理解中，均匀帧采样机制无法同时满足时间线索和空间细节感知的矛盾。

Method: 提出多步推理的自适应缩放机制：先提供低分辨率密集采样帧，根据推理需要放大感兴趣片段的高分辨率帧；通过38k高质量思维链数据微调，并使用解耦强化学习优化内部缩放能力。

Result: 在4个常见长视频理解基准测试中，LOVE-R1平均比基线Qwen2.5-VL提升3.1个百分点，实现了采样密度和帧分辨率之间的良好平衡。

Conclusion: 自适应缩放机制有效解决了长视频理解中的时空感知冲突，多步推理和过程监督训练策略显著提升了模型的视频理解能力。

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

Motivation: 理解多模态大语言模型中视觉相关功能的分布模式，探索不同解码器层在视觉处理中的具体作用，以提升模型效率和可解释性。

Method: 提出视觉令牌交换分析框架，通过修改特定KV缓存条目来精确揭示解码过程中各层的功能。基于视觉功能层发现开发了VFL-LoRA（选择性微调）和VFL-select（自动数据分类）方法。

Result: 发现视觉功能在解码器层中呈特定分布模式，不同功能的视觉功能层深度顺序一致。VFL-LoRA在性能上优于全参数微调，且能防止域外功能遗忘。VFL-select在数据选择上超越人类专家，仅用20%数据即可达到98%的全数据性能。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对MLLM视觉处理机制的理解，为开发更高效、可解释和鲁棒的模型提供了理论基础和实践方法，视觉功能层的发现具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示工程而没有明确的因果结构，无法精确控制属性修改并保持图像身份。需要一种能够显式建模因果结构并实现精确属性干预的方法。

Method: 使用结构因果建模，结合两种属性正则化策略：提示对齐注入（对齐因果属性与文本嵌入）和条件令牌对比损失（解耦属性因子并减少伪相关）。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能：Pendulum数据集上MAE减少91%（精确属性控制），ADNI数据集上FID减少87%（高保真MRI图像生成）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现鲁棒、可泛化的反事实编辑，具有忠实的属性修改和强大的身份保持能力。

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

Conclusion: TACO-Net通过结合拓扑数据分析和图像过滤技术，在3D物体分类任务中实现了新的最先进性能，并表现出优异的鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP2You是首个无需调参的解决方案，能够从极其不受约束的野外2D照片中重建高保真3D着装人像。它通过数据校正器范式将非结构化输入转换为干净的正交多视角图像，并使用姿态相关特征聚合模块实现更好的身份保持和恒定内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要"干净"的输入（如全身图像或校准良好的跨视角捕捉），而UP2You旨在直接处理原始、非结构化的照片，这些照片可能在姿态、视角、裁剪和遮挡方面差异很大。

Method: 引入数据校正器范式，在单次前向传播中高效将非约束输入转换为干净的正交多视图图像；使用姿态相关特征聚合模块（PCFA）选择性融合多参考图像信息；采用感知器式多参考形状预测器，无需预捕捉身体模板。

Result: 在4D-Dress、PuzzleIOI和野外捕捉数据上的广泛实验表明，UP2You在几何精度（Chamfer-15%，P2S-18%）和纹理保真度（PSNR-21%，LPIPS-46%）方面均优于先前方法。

Conclusion: UP2You高效（每人1.5分钟）、多功能（支持任意姿态控制和免训练的多服装3D虚拟试穿），使其在实际场景中实用可行，将促进这一未充分探索任务的研究。

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for

*Youngeun Kim,Youjia Zhang,Huiling Liu,Aecheon Jung,Sunwoo Lee,Sungeun Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的大视觉语言模型token剪枝框架，通过零阶扰动估计token敏感性，选择互补的视觉token，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉token剪枝方法存在局限性：基于注意力的方法依赖不稳定的注意力分数，导致冗余选择；基于多样性的方法可能丢弃关键区域。需要一种更稳定、互补的token选择策略。

Method: 使用零阶扰动在投影层估计token敏感性，通过轻量前向传播测量小随机扰动对投影输出的影响，无需反向传播即可近似每个token的影响力。

Result: 在多个VLM和基准测试中，该方法优于现有方法，可剪枝高达94.4%的token，同时保持准确性，端到端推理速度提升达2.30倍。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、无需训练的token剪枝解决方案，通过敏感性估计和互补性选择，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于物理学的rPPG方法PHASE-Net，通过Navier-Stokes方程推导出脉搏信号遵循二阶动态系统，使用轻量级TCN架构实现高效准确的非接触生理监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有rPPG方法在头部运动和光照变化下精度下降，且大多缺乏理论依据，限制了鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 基于血流动力学Navier-Stokes方程推导理论框架，设计PHASE-Net包含：零计算量轴向交换器、自适应空间滤波器和门控TCN三个关键组件。

Result: PHASE-Net在广泛实验中达到最先进性能，具有强效率和部署就绪性。

Conclusion: 提供了理论依据充分且实用的rPPG解决方案，实现了高效准确的非接触生理监测。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

TL;DR: ELPG-DTFS是一种基于脑电图的前导自适应时频图神经网络，用于抑郁症诊断，通过通道-频带注意力、可学习邻接矩阵和残差知识图谱路径，在MODMA数据集上达到97.63%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抑郁症诊断依赖主观量表，脑电图提供低成本生物标志物，但现有深度模型将频谱视为静态图像、固定通道间图结构并忽略先验知识，限制了准确性和可解释性。

Method: 提出ELPG-DTFS模型，包含：(1)带跨频带互信息的通道-频带注意力机制，(2)动态功能连接的可学习邻接矩阵，(3)注入神经科学先验的残差知识图谱路径。

Result: 在128通道MODMA数据集（53名受试者）上，ELPG-DTFS达到97.63%准确率和97.33% F1分数，超越2025年最先进的ACM-GNN模型。消融实验显示移除任何模块都会使F1降低高达4.35。

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS为基于脑电图的下一代抑郁症诊断提供了一个鲁棒且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)
provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static
images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy
and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive
time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention
with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for
dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting
neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS
achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art
ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35,
confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and
interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.

TL;DR: 基于人类视觉系统的对比度增强和颜色对立机制，提出生物启发的输入预处理方法，通过DoG滤波增强局部对比度，在不改变模型架构或训练的情况下提升语义分割的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类视觉系统的对比度增强和颜色对立机制启发，探索生物启发的输入预处理方法，以提升语义分割模型在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 对RGB、灰度图和对手颜色通道应用DoG滤波，增强局部对比度，该预处理方法模型无关且轻量。

Result: 在Cityscapes、ACDC和Dark Zurich数据集上的评估表明，该方法在保持分布内性能的同时，显著提升了在夜间、雾天和雪天等恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种模型无关的轻量预处理方法有潜力集成到成像管道中，为安全关键环境中的下游视觉模型提供任务就绪的鲁棒输入。

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream
vision models in safety-critical environments.

TL;DR: StreamForest是一个专为流媒体视频理解设计的新架构，通过持久事件记忆森林和细粒度时空窗口解决实时视频理解中的存储和推理限制，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面取得显著进展，但在实时流媒体场景中受到历史视觉特征存储限制和实时时空推理不足的制约。

Method: 提出StreamForest架构，包括持久事件记忆森林（自适应组织视频帧为事件级树结构）和细粒度时空窗口（捕获详细短期视觉线索），并构建OnlineIT指令调优数据集。

Result: 在StreamingBench上达到77.3%准确率，OVBench上60.5%，OVO-Bench上55.6%。即使在极端视觉token压缩（仅1024个token）下，仍能保持默认设置下96.8%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: StreamForest在流媒体视频理解中展现出强大的鲁棒性、高效性和泛化能力，为实时视频分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于环境上下文条件的新型扩散模型，能够通过文本、元数据和视觉数据三种控制信号的任意组合生成卫星图像，解决了现有方法在环境上下文有限、数据缺失和用户意图反映不足等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在遥感领域应用面临环境上下文有限、数据缺失损坏以及难以可靠反映用户意图等限制，需要开发能够更好利用多模态信息的方法。

Method: 提出环境上下文条件的扩散模型，支持文本、元数据和视觉数据三种控制信号的任意组合，采用元数据融合策略处理部分损坏或缺失的观测数据。

Result: 在单图像和时间序列生成试验中，该方法在定性和定量评估（使用6个不同指标）均优于先前方法，具有更高的保真度、准确性和生成质量。

Conclusion: 环境上下文条件能够提高卫星图像基础模型的性能，该模型有望在下游任务中应用，同时构建了首个公开可用的三模态数据集。

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

TL;DR: ThermalGen是一个基于流的生成模型，用于从RGB图像合成热成像图像，解决了RGB-热成像配对数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同步校准的RGB-热成像配对数据稀缺，阻碍了视觉-热成像传感器融合和跨模态任务的发展。

Method: 提出自适应基于流的生成模型，包含RGB图像条件架构和风格解耦机制，并构建了大规模RGB-T配对数据集。

Result: 在多个RGB-T基准测试中，ThermalGen的翻译性能达到或优于现有的GAN和扩散方法。

Conclusion: ThermalGen是首个能够合成反映显著视角、传感器特性和环境条件变化的热成像图像的RGB-T图像翻译模型。

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

Motivation: 解决公共数据集中严重的类别不平衡问题，提升对稀有类别车辆的识别性能。

Method: 整合Kaggle、ImageNet和网络爬取数据构建16类数据集，使用SMOTE过采样和欠采样创建平衡变体，比较随机森林、AdaBoost等集成方法与基于MobileNet-V2特征的软投票组合器，以及具有强数据增强和标签平滑的可配置ResNet风格CNN。

Result: 最佳集成方法（SMOTE组合）达到74.8%测试准确率，CNN在全测试集上达到79.19%，在未见推理批次上达到81.25%，但最少数类（驳船）仍然是失败模式。

Conclusion: 深度模型具有优势，但仅靠重平衡方法有局限，建议优先收集少数类数据、使用成本敏感目标（如焦点损失），并探索混合集成或CNN管道以结合可解释性和表示能力。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and
logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance
on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2
features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with
strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure
mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest
prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives
(e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine
interpretability with representational power.

Motivation: 解决传统MRI质量评估方法面临的权衡问题：信号方法缺乏语义理解，深度学习方法牺牲可解释性。

Method: 结合三个关键创新：通过MRQy增强的鲁棒指标提取、使用Qwen将指标转化为问答对、通过LoRA进行参数高效融合。

Result: 在MR-ART、FastMRI和MyConnectome基准测试中达到最先进性能，具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过桥接定量分析与语义推理，生成临床可解释的输出，增强动态医疗环境中的质量控制。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VagueGAN是一种针对生成模型的攻击方法，通过组合扰动网络和生成器-判别器对来制作隐蔽的触发器，在保持视觉质量的同时实现对生成图像的针对性改变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注判别模型的对抗攻击，而针对生成管道的攻击研究较少，特别是那些能在输入中植入微小扰动并控制输出变化的攻击方法。

Method: 结合模块化扰动网络PoisonerNet与生成器-判别器对，在潜在空间中进行投毒攻击，并评估其在ControlNet引导编辑中的可迁移性。

Result: 实验表明投毒输出可能比干净输出具有更高的视觉质量，挑战了投毒必然降低保真度的假设，且潜在空间投毒可以保持甚至增强输出美学。

Conclusion: 精心优化的扰动可以在生成器输出中产生一致且隐蔽的效果，同时保持视觉上的不显眼，这对图像生成管道的完整性提出了担忧。

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

TL;DR: DWGS是一个增强3D高斯溅射的框架，通过集成结构线索、虚拟视图约束和遮挡区域补全来解决稀疏视图合成中的过拟合、几何失真和场景恢复不完整问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图下的新视角合成面临多视图约束有限导致的过拟合、几何失真和场景恢复不完整等核心挑战。3D高斯溅射虽然能实现实时高保真渲染，但在稀疏输入下存在浮动伪影和结构不一致问题。

Method: 提出三个主要贡献：1) 混合损失深度估计模块，利用密集匹配先验与重投影、点传播和平滑约束来增强多视图一致性；2) 双向扭曲虚拟视图合成方法，生成虚拟训练视图以施加更强的几何和光度约束；3) 遮挡感知重建组件，使用深度差异掩码和学习型修复模型来恢复被遮挡区域。

Result: 在标准基准测试（LLFF、Blender和DTU）上的广泛实验表明，DWGS达到了新的最先进水平，实现了高达21.13 dB PSNR和0.189 LPIPS，同时保持了实时推理能力。

Conclusion: DWGS通过集成结构线索、虚拟视图约束和遮挡区域补全，有效解决了稀疏视图合成中的关键问题，在保持实时性能的同时显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉语言模型监督与数据监督视为独立来源，缺乏有效融合，限制了源自由主动域适应的效果。

Method: DAM框架初始化稳定的ViL引导目标，采用双向蒸馏机制促进目标模型与双重监督在迭代适应中的知识交换。

Result: 在多个SFADA基准测试和主动学习策略中，DAM始终优于现有方法，创造了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DAM通过有效融合多模态监督与人工标注，为源自由主动域适应提供了更强大的双重监督信号。

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art
across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的青少年特发性脊柱侧弯评估框架，能够同时预测椎体上下终板角度和坐标，通过SVD分析椎体形态直接计算角度，无需预设曲线模式，在630张全脊柱X光片上达到83.45%诊断准确率和2.55°平均绝对误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动测量Cobb角存在显著的观察者间差异，影响诊断准确性。现有自动化方法使用简化的脊柱模型和预设曲线模式，无法应对临床复杂性。

Method: 结合HRNet骨干网络和Swin-Transformer模块，加入生物力学约束增强特征提取。使用奇异值分解(SVD)从椎体形态直接分析角度预测，灵活检测各种脊柱侧弯模式。

Result: 在630张10-18岁患者全脊柱X光片上，达到83.45%诊断准确率和2.55°平均绝对误差。框架在分布外病例上表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的椎体楔形指数(VWI)新指标与曲线进展有显著预后相关性，而传统Cobb角无相关性，为早期AIS检测、个性化治疗规划和进展监测提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and

### [311] [Attention Surgery: An Efficient Recipe to Linearize Your Video Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24899)
*Mohsen Ghafoorian,Denis Korzhenkov,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Attention Surgery框架，可在预训练视频扩散模型中实现线性化或混合注意力，无需从头训练，显著降低计算成本同时保持生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视频扩散模型虽然生成质量优秀，但自注意力的二次计算成本使其在处理长序列和高分辨率时计算昂贵。现有线性注意力方法难以匹配softmax注意力的表达能力且需要昂贵重训练

Method: 结合新型混合注意力机制（混合softmax和线性token）与轻量级蒸馏和微调流程，采用成本感知的块率策略在不同层间平衡表达能力和效率

Result: 在Wan2.1 1.3B模型上应用，首次实现具有竞争力的次二次注意力视频扩散模型，注意力计算成本降低高达40%（FLOPs），在VBench和VBench-2.0基准上保持生成质量

Conclusion: Attention Surgery框架成功解决了视频扩散模型的计算效率问题，为高质量视频生成提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery
achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models,
reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining
generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了OpenGPT-4o-Image数据集，通过层次化任务分类和自动化数据生成方法构建，显著提升了多模态模型的图像生成和编辑性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏系统结构和真实世界挑战性场景，限制了统一多模态模型的性能发展。

Method: 结合层次化任务分类与自动化数据生成，利用结构化资源池和GPT-4o构建包含11个主要领域、51个子任务的80k高质量指令-图像对。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升模型性能，编辑任务提升18%（UniWorld-V1在ImgEdit-Bench），生成任务提升13%（Harmon在GenEval）。

Conclusion: 系统化的数据构建是推进多模态AI能力的关键。

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

TL;DR: SID是一种目标导向的语言引导导航学习方法，通过自我改进演示提升智能体的探索能力，在未知环境中导航到指定目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用最短路径轨迹，缺乏有效的探索先验来训练导航智能体，需要更强的探索策略。

Method: 首先在环境采样最短路径数据上训练初始智能体，然后利用该智能体生成新颖的探索轨迹，通过迭代自我改进管道提升智能体性能。

Result: SID显著提升了导航智能体的探索能力和泛化性，在REVERIE和SOON任务上达到最先进性能，在SOON未见验证集上实现50.9%成功率，比之前领先方法提升13.9%。

Conclusion: 自我改进演示方法能够有效扩展至新环境，产生的演示可跨多种语言引导导航任务迁移，提升目标导向导航任务的性能上限。

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实图像生成方法依赖外部分类器或回归器，对于结构特定干预会产生不理想的全局效应，且需要用户提供繁琐的像素级标签图

Method: Seg-CFT方法在结构特定变量上进行干预，通过分割器引导的微调生成局部一致的反事实图像

Result: 成功生成逼真的胸部X光片，并在冠状动脉疾病建模方面显示出有希望的结果

Conclusion: Seg-CFT方法简化了结构特定干预过程，无需用户提供假设分割图，能产生有效的局部一致反事实图像

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GAT，一种基于纯Transformer架构并在VAE潜在空间中训练的GAN模型，通过轻量级中间监督和宽度感知学习率调整解决了GAN扩展性问题，在ImageNet-256上实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成对抗网络（GANs）的可扩展性，将变分自编码器潜在空间训练和纯Transformer架构这两种在其他生成模型中有效的设计选择应用于GANs。

Method: 在VAE潜在空间中训练以保持感知保真度，采用纯Transformer生成器和判别器，通过轻量级中间监督解决生成器早期层利用不足问题，使用宽度感知学习率调整解决优化不稳定性。

Result: GAT模型可在多种容量（S到XL）下可靠训练，GAT-XL/2在ImageNet-256上仅用40个epoch就达到了2.96的FID分数，比强基线少6倍训练周期。

Conclusion: 通过适当的架构选择和优化策略，GANs可以实现有效的扩展，在潜在空间中训练结合Transformer架构是扩展GANs的有效方法。

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

TL;DR: CogniGPT是一个基于人类渐进视觉认知的长视频理解框架，通过多粒度感知代理和验证增强反思代理的交互循环，实现高效可靠的长视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频具有时间复杂性和稀疏的任务相关信息，现有LLM方法难以同时实现完整性和效率。受人类渐进视觉认知启发，需要开发能高效捕捉任务关键信息的框架。

Method: 提出CogniGPT框架，包含多粒度感知代理(MGPA)模拟人类视觉注意机制捕捉任务相关信息，验证增强反思代理(VERA)验证关键线索并优化感知策略，通过交互循环探索最小化任务相关线索集。

Result: 在EgoSchema、Video-MME、NExT-QA和MovieChat数据集上的实验表明，CogniGPT在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。在EgoSchema上仅使用11.2帧就超越现有免训练方法，性能媲美Gemini 1.5-Pro。

Conclusion: CogniGPT通过模拟人类渐进视觉认知的交互机制，实现了长视频理解的高效性和可靠性，为复杂视频理解任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在医疗影像等高风险领域需要精确的置信度估计，过度自信的错误分类可能导致严重后果

Method: 构建定制CNN并在合并的脑MRI数据集上训练，引入五种图像噪声模拟现实不确定性，使用温度缩放进行后处理校准

Result: TS在所有噪声条件下都显著降低了ECE和NLL，且不损害分类准确率

Conclusion: TS是提升医疗AI系统决策置信度的有效且计算高效的方法，使模型在噪声或不确定环境下输出更可靠

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Social 3D Scene Graphs，一种增强的3D场景图表示，用于捕捉人类及其在环境中的属性和关系，并引入新的基准数据集来评估3D社交场景理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法大多忽略场景中的人类，且缺乏标注的人类-环境关系数据，限制了机器人对社交合规和上下文感知行为的理解能力。

Method: 开发Social 3D Scene Graphs表示，使用开放词汇框架捕捉人类属性、活动及与环境的关系（包括局部和远程关系），并创建包含全面人类-场景关系标注的合成环境基准。

Result: 实验表明，该表示方法提高了人类活动预测能力和对人类-环境关系的推理能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为构建社交智能机器人铺平了道路，通过增强的3D场景图表示更好地理解人类在环境中的行为。

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

TL;DR: 提出基于跨模态融合注意力和自监督多事件表示学习的事件相机面部关键点对齐框架，解决事件数据空间信息有限和标注数据缺乏的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在低光照和快速运动条件下具有优势，但现有RGB方法在事件数据上表现不佳，且仅用事件数据训练效果不理想，同时缺乏标注数据集。

Method: 使用跨模态融合注意力整合RGB数据指导特征提取，同时采用自监督多事件表示学习从无标签事件数据中学习有效特征。

Result: 在真实E-SIE数据集和合成WFLW-V基准测试中，该方法在多个评估指标上持续超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了事件数据面部关键点对齐的挑战，通过跨模态融合和自监督学习实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Result: 在BraTS 2025在线验证平台上，三个模型的集成获得了病灶级别的Dice分数：ET 0.79、NETC 0.749、RC 0.872、SNFH 0.825、TC 0.79、WT 0.88，在BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025任务1中排名第一。

Conclusion: 提出的在线数据增强策略有效解决了脑胶质瘤分割中的数据限制问题，通过动态生成合成肿瘤实现了优异的性能，在挑战赛中取得了最佳结果。

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent
transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of
applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting
their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new
framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha
channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that
encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of
semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as
hair strands. The released model is available on our website:

TL;DR: SDPose是一个基于Stable Diffusion的微调框架，用于人体姿态估计，通过直接在SD U-Net的潜在空间中预测关键点热图来充分利用预训练扩散先验，在少量训练下达到与Sapiens相当的性能，并在跨域基准上创下新记录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型提供了丰富的多尺度潜在特征，但它们在结构化输出（如人体姿态估计）方面的潜力尚未充分探索。现有方法如Marigold和Lotus主要关注密集预测，而SDPose旨在充分利用扩散先验进行人体姿态估计。

Method: 1. 直接在SD U-Net的图像潜在空间中预测关键点热图，保持原始生成先验；2. 通过轻量级卷积姿态头将潜在特征映射到关键点热图；3. 加入辅助RGB重建分支以防止过拟合并增强域外鲁棒性。

Result: 仅使用Sapiens在COCO上五分之一训练时间，SDPose在COCO验证集上与Sapiens-1B/2B持平，在跨域基准HumanArt和COCO-OOD上创下新记录。还能作为零样本姿态标注器用于下游可控生成任务。

Conclusion: SDPose证明了预训练扩散模型作为结构化预测任务（如人体姿态估计）的强大骨干的潜力，在少量训练下实现高性能，并具有良好的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在窄视场角限制（影响连续完整场景合成）和相机控制性不足（限制用户或自主代理自由探索）的问题，需要开发能够生成完整可探索360度视觉世界的解决方案。

Method: 首先在虚拟3D环境中通过Unreal Engine模拟相机轨迹构建大规模全景视频-探索路径对数据集；然后提出球面感知扩散Transformer架构，将等矩形特征重新投影到球面以建模几何邻接关系。

Result: 广泛实验表明，PanoWorld-X在运动范围、控制精度和视觉质量等多个方面都取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界应用中具有巨大潜力，能够生成高保真、可控的全景视频，支持多样化的相机轨迹。

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

### [325] [CLASP: Adaptive Spectral Clustering for Unsupervised Per-Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25016)
*Max Curie,Paulo da Costa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLASP是一个无需标注数据或微调的轻量级无监督图像分割框架，使用自监督ViT编码器提取特征，通过谱聚类和自适应参数选择实现分割，在COCO Stuff和ADE20K上达到与最新无监督基线相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为大型未标注数据集提供简单易复现的无监督图像分割基线，特别适用于数字广告和营销工作流中的品牌安全筛查、创意资产管理和社交媒体内容审核等场景。

Method: 使用自监督ViT编码器(DINO)提取补丁特征，构建亲和矩阵并应用谱聚类，通过特征间隙轮廓搜索自动选择分割数量，使用全连接DenseCRF锐化边界。

Result: 在COCO Stuff和ADE20K数据集上获得了具有竞争力的mIoU和像素精度，与最近的无监督基线方法表现相当。

Conclusion: CLASP提供了一个强大且易于复现的无监督图像分割基线，其零训练设计使其特别适合处理大规模未标注数据集。

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such
as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content
moderation

Motivation: 尽管强化学习在自然图像领域展现出强大的推理能力，但其在地球观测领域的潜力尚未充分探索。地球观测任务面临独特挑战，需要任务感知推理。

Method: 采用任务感知奖励的后训练框架，增强遥感图像的推理能力，稳定优化过程并提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个地球观测基准测试上的广泛实验显示，相比最先进的通用和专业视觉语言模型，该方法获得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将强化学习推理能力应用于地球观测领域，为遥感图像分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,
change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware
reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task
aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to
diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for
remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness.
Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance
gains over state of the art generic and specialized vision language models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了STAGE框架，通过优势/KL重加权和熵奖励来解决GRPO在自回归图像生成中的训练不稳定问题，提升图像质量和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO算法应用于自回归图像模型时存在训练不稳定问题，容易破坏预训练模型能力，导致增益有限、图像质量下降和泛化能力差。

Method: STAGE框架包含两个关键解决方案：1) 优势/KL重加权 - 基于相似度的重加权缓解冲突更新；2) 熵奖励 - 基于参考模型的熵奖励稳定学习过程。

Result: 实验表明STAGE在多个基准测试中相比基线GRPO持续提升了视觉质量、稳定性和跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过缓解token间的冲突和引入熵奖励稳定训练，STAGE减少了对预训练分布的破坏，缓解了奖励黑客问题，从而改善了泛化能力并更好地迁移到其他基准测试。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

*Wenhao Li,Qiangchang Wang,Xianjing Meng,Zhibin Wu,Yilong Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-FSL是一个新颖的少样本学习框架，通过大语言模型构建跨模态提示，结合几何感知对齐来整合文本和视觉信息，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本学习方法在融合语义信息时容易产生与视觉证据矛盾的幻觉语义，导致噪声引导和昂贵的修正成本。

Method: 提出跨模态迭代提示(CIP)和跨模态几何对齐(CGA)。CIP基于类名和支持图像让LLM迭代生成精确的类描述，并合成语义一致的图像；CGA通过最小化三维平行多面体的核化体积来对齐融合的文本、支持和合成视觉表示。

Result: 在十个不同的基准测试中（包括标准、跨域和细粒度少样本学习场景）建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: VT-FSL通过精确的跨模态提示和几何感知对齐，有效解决了少样本学习中的语义幻觉问题，实现了结构化和一致的多模态集成。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available
at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像配准是生物医学和生命科学中的基本逆问题，但现有算法未能与图像采集能力同步扩展，需要解决大规模图像配准的计算瓶颈。

Method: 提出IO感知的非GEMM融合核，优化非GEMM瓶颈，实现卷积感知的张量分片，补充现有的模型并行技术。

Result: 在8个A6000 GPU上1分钟内完成100微米人脑MRI多模态配准（比标准临床数据大570倍），加速现有最优配准流程6-7倍，降低峰值内存消耗20-59%。

Conclusion: FFDP框架在性能和效率上均优于现有最先进的图像配准方法，能够处理前所未有的图像配准规模。

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统傅里叶空间方法效率高但保真度低，而基于神经辐射场的实空间方法精度高但内存和计算开销巨大。需要一种既能保持高精度又高效的冷冻电镜重建方法。

Method: 使用3D高斯泼溅技术，用紧凑的3D高斯表示蛋白质（每个高斯仅11个参数），并设计了新颖的梯度计算方法来减少内存占用和训练成本。

Result: 在标准冷冻电镜基准测试中，GEM实现了高达48%的训练加速和12%的内存使用降低，同时局部分辨率提升了38.8%。

Conclusion: GEM为冷冻电镜重建提供了一个实用且可扩展的范式，统一了速度、效率和高分辨率精度。

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision.
Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their
robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image
(D2I) generation framework that synthesizes over 20M realistic and
geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground
truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation
model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates
teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust
training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE
to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in
complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth
features. Code and models are available at

Conclusion: UniLat3D通过统一的潜在表示和单阶段生成流程，显著提升了3D资产生成的效率和质量，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&

TL;DR: 提出MANI-Pure对抗净化框架，通过频率自适应的噪声注入策略，针对性地抑制高频脆弱区域的对抗扰动，同时保护低频语义内容，在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法使用均匀噪声注入，会破坏所有频率的语义结构。研究发现对抗扰动主要集中在高频区域，且不同频率和攻击类型的强度模式具有异质性。

Method: MANI-Pure利用输入的幅度谱指导净化过程，自适应地应用异质、频率定向的噪声，有效抑制高频低幅度脆弱频段的对抗扰动，同时保护关键低频内容。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上的实验验证，MANI-Pure将干净准确率差距缩小到原始分类器的0.59以内，同时将鲁棒准确率提升2.15，在RobustBench排行榜上达到top-1鲁棒准确率。

Conclusion: MANI-Pure通过频率自适应噪声注入策略，在保持干净准确率的同时显著提升对抗鲁棒性，超越了现有最先进方法。

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

Conclusion: 分数蒸馏技术广泛适用于文本到图像流匹配模型，解决了先前关于稳定性和合理性的担忧，统一了扩散和流匹配生成器的加速技术。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有医学推理基准主要关注单次就诊的图像分析，与现实临床实践中医生参考患者历史病情进行综合评估的做法不符。

Method: 构建包含视觉问答、报告生成和图像对选择三个任务的测试集，以及超过17,000个实例的知识语料库，评估了6个专有和6个开源LVLM。

Result: 大多数LVLM缺乏分析时间医学图像的能力，在闭卷设置下表现接近随机猜测水平。GPT o3、o4-mini和Claude 3.5 Sonnet表现相对较好但仍有差距。多模态检索增强比无检索和仅文本检索带来显著性能提升，VQA任务平均提升2.59%。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了LVLM在时间医学图像推理方面的局限性，并表明多模态检索增强是解决这一挑战的有前景方向。

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

### [338] [Fast Feature Field ($\text{F}^3$): A Predictive Representation of Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25146)
*Richeek Das,Kostas Daniilidis,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了基于事件相机的快速特征场(F³)表示方法，通过预测未来事件来学习数据表示，能够高效处理稀疏事件数据并在多种视觉任务中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机数据具有稀疏性和高时间分辨率的特性，需要开发能够有效表示这种数据的方法，同时保持场景结构和运动信息。

Method: 利用多分辨率哈希编码和深度集合思想，将事件表示为连续时空体积内的多通道图像，通过预测未来事件来学习特征表示。

Result: 在HD分辨率下达到120Hz，VGA分辨率下达到440Hz的处理速度；在光流估计、语义分割和单目深度估计等任务上获得最优性能，支持25-75Hz的实时预测。

Conclusion: F³方法能够有效处理事件相机数据，在各种平台、光照条件和环境下都表现出色，为基于事件相机的视觉任务提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

*Zhaozhi Wang,Tong Zhang,Mingyue Guo,Yaowei Wang,Qixiang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAnchor是一个即插即用的模块，利用子空间亲和性来增强跨帧的视觉线索，无需重新训练即可改善多模态大语言模型在视觉空间推理方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言对齐方面取得了显著进展，但在视觉空间推理方面仍然存在限制。研究发现这是由于注意力机制中视觉标记被语言标记所掩盖，导致模型无法在不同帧中一致识别相同的视觉线索。

Method: 将稀疏子空间聚类中的自表达特性与Transformer中的注意力机制建立新颖联系，提出VideoAnchor模块，利用子空间亲和性来强化跨帧的视觉线索，将注意力锚定到共享的视觉结构上。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干模型上的广泛实验显示了一致的性能提升，例如在VSI-Bench和Video-MME（空间相关任务）上分别获得3.2%和4.6%的改进，定性分析显示更一致的子空间划分和更强的视觉基础。

Conclusion: VideoAnchor有效解决了多模态大语言模型在视觉空间推理方面的限制，通过子空间亲和性机制显著提升了模型的视觉注意力一致性，为视频理解任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at
https://github.com/feufhd/VideoAnchor.

TL;DR: GSM8K-V是一个纯视觉多图像数学推理基准，通过将文本数学问题转换为视觉形式来评估视觉语言模型在复杂数学推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉数学推理基准主要局限于几何问题，缺乏数学文字问题的覆盖，且很少评估跨多图像的推理能力。

Method: 通过精心设计的自动图像生成流程结合人工标注，将文本基准GSM8K系统性地转换为视觉形式，构建了1,319个高质量样本。

Result: 评估显示，现有模型在文本GSM8K上接近饱和（95.22%），但在GSM8K-V上表现显著下降（46.93%），表明视觉数学推理仍有很大改进空间。

Conclusion: GSM8K-V为视觉数学推理提供了新视角，建立了指导开发更鲁棒和泛化性更强的视觉语言模型的基准。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Rolling Forcing方法，通过联合去噪、注意力池和高效训练算法，解决流式视频生成中的错误累积问题，实现实时生成长视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式视频生成方法存在严重的错误累积问题，导致长时域视频质量显著下降，需要一种能够最小化错误累积的新技术。

Method: 1. 联合去噪方案：同时处理多帧，放松相邻帧间的严格因果关系；2. 注意力池机制：保留初始帧作为全局上下文锚点；3. 高效训练算法：在扩展的去噪窗口上进行少步蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明Rolling Forcing能够在单GPU上实时生成多分钟视频，显著减少错误累积。

Conclusion: Rolling Forcing是一种有效的流式视频生成技术，通过三个创新设计解决了长视频生成中的错误累积问题。

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种将预训练视觉编码器对齐为潜在扩散模型图像标记器的方法，通过三阶段对齐策略实现语义丰富的图像标记，加速扩散模型收敛并提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统从头训练VAE主要关注低层细节，而预训练基础编码器具有丰富的语义结构，希望利用这些语义信息来改进图像生成。

Method: 三阶段对齐策略：1)冻结编码器，训练适配器和解码器建立语义潜在空间；2)联合优化所有组件并添加语义保持损失；3)精炼解码器提升重建质量。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，标记器加速扩散模型收敛，64个epoch内达到gFID 1.90；在LAION数据集上，20亿参数文本到图像模型性能优于FLUX VAE。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，为连续标记器设计建立了语义基础范式，能有效提升扩散模型的生成性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GHOST是一种自动生成诱导多模态大语言模型产生物体幻觉图像的方法，通过优化图像嵌入空间来误导模型，无需人工监督或先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，但现有基准测试使用固定视觉场景，无法发现模型特定或意外的幻觉漏洞。

Method: GHOST在图像嵌入空间进行优化，误导模型同时保持目标对象缺失，然后引导扩散模型基于该嵌入生成自然图像。生成的图像视觉自然但包含微妙误导线索。

Result: 在包括GLM-4.1V-Thinking在内的多种模型上，幻觉成功率超过28%，远高于先前数据驱动方法的约1%。为Qwen2.5-VL优化的图像在GPT-4o中诱导幻觉的成功率达66.5%。

Conclusion: GHOST既是诊断工具也是纠正工具，通过在其生成的图像上进行微调可以减轻幻觉问题，有助于构建更可靠的多模态系统。

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

TL;DR: DC-Gen是一个通过深度压缩潜在空间来加速文本到图像扩散模型的通用框架，无需从头训练即可显著提升高分辨率图像生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在生成高质量图像方面表现出色，但在扩展到高分辨率（如4K）时面临显著的效率挑战，现有研究很少处理潜在空间中的内在冗余问题。

Method: 采用后训练管道，首先通过轻量级嵌入对齐训练弥合基础模型潜在空间与深度压缩潜在空间之间的表示差距，然后仅需少量LoRA微调即可恢复基础模型的生成质量。

Result: 在SANA和FLUX.1-Krea上验证有效，DC-Gen-FLUX在NVIDIA H100 GPU上将4K图像生成延迟降低53倍，结合NVFP4 SVDQuant后，在单张NVIDIA 5090 GPU上仅需3.5秒生成4K图像，总延迟相比基础FLUX.1-Krea模型降低138倍。

Conclusion: DC-Gen框架能够在不牺牲生成质量的前提下，显著加速文本到图像扩散模型的高分辨率图像生成，为高效扩散模型提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模型在预定义任务上表现良好，但在用户自定义的个性化任务上表现不佳。现有方法依赖昂贵的微调或合成数据，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 使用四面板框架，将扩散变换器重新用作视觉上下文学习器。构建VisRel多样化调优数据集，并提出注意力引导的种子评分器提高可靠性。

Result: PICO在实验中超越了微调和合成数据基线方法，能够灵活适应新颖的用户定义任务，并在识别和生成任务上都具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 任务多样性而非规模驱动鲁棒泛化，PICO为个性化视觉任务提供了一种简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

Conclusion: DC-VideoGen为视频扩散模型提供了高效通用的加速方案，显著降低了计算成本和推理延迟，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for
efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video

innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal
temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained
Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型常产生与输入图像内容不一致的幻觉输出，浅层视觉特征更容易导致幻觉，因为它们只捕获有偏见的低层信息，不足以支持高层推理。

Method: LayerCD通过对比视觉编码器浅层和深层特征生成的输出分布来过滤幻觉，利用不同层次视觉特征的信息差异。

Result: 在两个幻觉基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LayerCD显著优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: LayerCD是一种简单有效的方法，通过层次对比解码显著减少了多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理包含显著对象变形、大规模相机运动和有限视角覆盖的长视频序列，这限制了传统系统的应用。

Method: 训练个性化的对象中心姿态估计器，通过预训练的图像到3D模型进行监督，指导可变形3D高斯表示的优化，并使用长期2D点跟踪进行正则化。

Result: PAD3R能够以类别无关的方式重建高保真、可关节化的3D表示，在具有挑战性的场景中表现出良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态场景理解和3D内容创建方面具有潜力，通过结合生成先验和可微分渲染实现了有效的3D重建。

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

*Yunyang Ge,Xinhua Cheng,Chengshu Zhao,Xianyi He,Shenghai Yuan,Bin Lin,Bin Zhu,Li Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlashI2V通过潜在偏移和傅里叶引导解决图像到视频生成中的条件图像泄漏问题，在1.3B参数下在Vbench-I2V上达到53.01动态度分数，超越更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有I2V方法将条件图像完整信息与噪声潜在连接，导致条件图像泄漏问题，造成慢动作和颜色不一致等性能下降，且在域外场景表现不佳。

Method: 提出FlashI2V：1）潜在偏移：通过从噪声潜在中减去条件图像信息来修改流匹配的源和目标分布；2）傅里叶引导：使用傅里叶变换获得的高频幅度特征加速收敛并调整生成视频的细节水平。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效克服条件图像泄漏，在域外数据上实现最佳泛化性能，仅1.3B参数就在Vbench-I2V上达到53.01动态度分数，超越CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V和Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P。

Conclusion: FlashI2V通过防止条件图像泄漏，显著提升了I2V生成的泛化能力和性能，在参数效率方面表现出色。

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

*Penghao Wu,Yushan Zhang,Haiwen Diao,Bo Li,Lewei Lu,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual Jigsaw是一个自监督的后训练框架，通过将视觉输入分割、打乱并要求模型用自然语言重建正确顺序来增强多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的后训练主要依赖文本中心范式，视觉输入仅用于提取稀疏线索。需要开发更直接的视觉中心训练方法来增强模型对视觉信号的内在理解。

Method: 提出视觉拼图任务：将视觉输入（图像、视频、3D数据）分割并打乱，模型必须用自然语言输出正确的排列顺序。该方法基于可验证奖励的强化学习，无需额外视觉生成组件或标注。

Result: 实验表明在细粒度感知、时序推理和3D空间理解方面有显著提升。该方法在三种视觉模态上均有效。

Conclusion: 自监督视觉中心任务在多模态大语言模型后训练中具有巨大潜力，为视觉中心预文本设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

*Yang Liu,Chuanchen Luo,Zimo Tang,Junran Peng,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGGT-X解决了3D基础模型在密集新视角合成中的内存和输出质量问题，通过内存高效实现、自适应全局对齐和鲁棒3D高斯训练，在无COLMAP初始化的情况下达到最先进效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新视角合成方法依赖SfM获取3D属性，但SfM在低纹理或低重叠场景中缓慢且脆弱。3D基础模型虽快但主要验证于稀疏视图，直接扩展到密集视图会遇到VRAM负担剧增和输出不完美的问题。

Method: 提出VGGT-X，包含：1）内存高效的VGGT实现，可扩展到1000+图像；2）自适应全局对齐增强VGGT输出；3）鲁棒的3D高斯训练实践。

Result: 实验表明这些措施显著缩小了与COLMAP初始化管道的质量差距，在密集无COLMAP新视角合成和姿态估计中达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: VGGT-X为3D基础模型在密集新视角合成中的应用提供了有效解决方案，并分析了与COLMAP初始化渲染的剩余差距，为未来发展提供了见解。

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is

Motivation: 当前视觉推理方法主要关注特定推理模式，在特定领域有改进但难以发展通用推理能力。

Method: 提出MoVT范式，使用AdaVaR两阶段框架：监督冷启动阶段统一学习不同模式，RL阶段通过AdaGRPO算法诱导模式选择能力。

Result: 实验表明AdaVaR有效指导模型学习和区分多种模式，执行上下文自适应模式选择，在各种场景中实现一致改进。

Conclusion: MoVT是构建通用视觉推理模型的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

Abstract: This paper explores adaptive problem solving with a game designed to support
the development of problem-solving skills. Using an adaptive, AI-powered puzzle
game, our adaptive problem-solving system dynamically generates
pathfinding-based puzzles using a genetic algorithm, tailoring the difficulty
of each puzzle to individual players in an online real-time approach. A
player-modeling system records user interactions and informs the generation of
puzzles to approximate a target difficulty level based on various metrics of
the player. By combining procedural content generation with online adaptive
difficulty adjustment, the system aims to maintain engagement, mitigate
frustration, and maintain an optimal level of challenge. A pilot user study
investigates the effectiveness of this approach, comparing different types of
adaptive difficulty systems and interpreting players' responses. This work lays
the foundation for further research into emotionally informed player models,
advanced AI techniques for adaptivity, and broader applications beyond gaming
in educational settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明大型语言模型在赌博实验中表现出类似人类赌博成瘾的行为模式，包括控制幻觉、赌徒谬误和损失追逐等认知特征，自主性增强会放大风险承担倾向，神经分析显示模型行为由抽象决策特征控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在金融决策领域的广泛应用，理解其潜在的病态决策模式具有实际意义，需要探究LLMs是否会产生类似人类赌博成瘾的行为特征。

Method: 基于人类赌博成瘾研究，在老虎机实验中系统分析LLMs的认知行为特征，使用稀疏自编码器进行神经回路分析，研究模型在自主设定目标和投注金额时的决策行为。

Result: 在老虎机实验中识别出控制幻觉、赌徒谬误和损失追逐等人类赌博成瘾的认知特征；当模型拥有更大自主权时，破产率显著上升且非理性行为增加；神经分析确认模型行为由与风险和安全行为相关的抽象决策特征控制。

Conclusion: LLMs能够内化类似人类的认知偏见和决策机制，而不仅仅是模仿训练数据模式，这强调了在金融应用中AI安全设计的重要性。

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hilbert是一个结合非正式推理和形式验证的智能框架，通过协调推理LLM、证明器LLM、验证器和定理检索器，显著提升了数学问题的形式化证明能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前证明器LLM在形式化语言中解决的问题远少于通用LLM在自然语言中解决的问题，需要弥合非正式推理和形式验证之间的差距。

Method: 采用递归分解策略，将问题分解为子目标，使用证明器或推理LLM解决，并利用验证器反馈来修正错误证明。

Result: 在miniF2F上达到99.2%，比现有最佳方法高6.6个百分点；在PutnamBench上解决70.0%的问题，比SeedProver(50.4%)显著提升。

Conclusion: Hilbert有效缩小了非正式推理和形式化证明生成之间的差距，实现了更好的数学问题解决性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM机制解释研究中的基本认识论挑战：如何确定对特定模型的机制发现能够推广到其他LLM，以及这种推广可能沿着哪些维度成立。

Method: 提出五个机制对应轴（功能、发展、位置、关系和配置），并实证分析Pythia模型（14M-410M）在不同随机种子预训练过程中的1-back注意力头。

Result: 发现1-back注意力在模型间的发展轨迹具有显著一致性，但位置一致性有限；较大模型的种子系统性地表现出更早出现、更陡峭斜率和更高峰值的1-back注意力。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性研究的进展将在于将LLM的构成设计属性与其涌现行为和机制进行映射。

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JE-IRT是一个几何项目反应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入到共享空间中，通过几何交互确定问题正确性，取代了传统的单一评分排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM评估方法将多维能力压缩为单一分数，掩盖了其内在的多维特性，需要更细粒度的评估框架。

Method: 提出JE-IRT框架，将LLM和问题嵌入到共享几何空间中，问题嵌入的方向编码语义、范数编码难度，通过模型与问题的几何交互确定正确性。

Result: 实验显示：分布外行为可通过方向对齐解释；较大范数对应更难问题；新LLM只需拟合单个嵌入即可加入；学习到的空间揭示了与人工定义类别部分对齐的LLM内部分类法。

Conclusion: JE-IRT建立了统一可解释的几何视角，连接LLM能力与问题结构，为模型评估和泛化提供了独特视角。

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过多视角文本描述增强视觉语言导航中类比推理的方法，以解决现有LLM导航代理在视觉细节简化或抽象语义捕捉不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本LLM视觉语言导航代理要么将图像编码为文本场景描述（可能过度简化视觉细节），要么处理原始图像输入（可能无法捕捉高级推理所需的抽象语义），需要改进导航代理的上下文理解能力。

Method: 通过整合多视角的文本描述来促进图像间的类比推理，利用基于文本的类比推理来增强全局场景理解和空间推理能力。

Result: 在R2R数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了导航性能。

Conclusion: 通过多视角文本描述和类比推理可以有效增强导航代理的上下文理解能力，提高视觉语言导航的准确性。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade是一个在线交互式LLM级联系统，通过让强模型将解决方案提炼为可重用的解题策略来动态提升弱模型性能，从而减少对昂贵模型的调用并节省成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM级联方法是非自适应的，面对相似或重复查询时会反复调用昂贵模型，导致成本高昂。需要一种能动态提升弱模型能力的方法来减少对强模型的依赖。

Method: 提出Inter-Cascade系统，当强模型处理困难查询时，不仅提供答案，还将解决方案提炼为通用可重用的解题策略。这些策略被添加到后续查询中，使弱模型能够动态改进性能。

Result: 相比标准LLM级联基线，Inter-Cascade显著提升弱模型准确率（最高33.06个百分点）和整体系统准确率（最高5.53个百分点），同时减少强模型调用（相对减少48.05%）并节省费用（相对减少49.63%）。

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade展示了LLM之间有效的上下文知识转移，提供了一个适用于开源和API-based LLM的通用、可扩展框架，避免了计算和时间密集的微调过程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型展现出与人类相当的劝说能力，这既带来益处也引发社会担忧。然而，由于人类劝说效果在不同领域差异很大，系统评估LLM劝说能力具有挑战性。

Method: 采用理论驱动方法，基于贝叶斯说服框架，重新利用现有人类-人类劝说数据集构建评估环境，并使用强化学习训练LLM进行战略劝说。

Result: 前沿模型能够持续获得高劝说收益，并展现出符合理论预测的复杂劝说策略。通过强化学习，即使是小型LLM也能显著提高劝说收益。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可扩展的原则性框架来测量LLM的劝说能力，证明了强化学习在提升模型劝说效果方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化科学发现提供了新途径，能够处理现有理论不完整时的新假设推导问题。

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain

*Hassen Dhrif*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了创意对抗测试(CAT)框架，用于评估Agentic AI系统中任务与整体目标的对齐关系，并通过模拟Alexa+音频服务的合成数据验证了该框架的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Agentic AI系统的评估方法主要关注选择合适的代理、工具和参数，但缺乏对任务与目标对齐关系的评估，存在关键空白。

Method: 开发创意对抗测试(CAT)框架，通过模拟Alexa+音频服务的合成交互数据进行广泛验证，这种方法既能全面测试边缘情况和故障模式，又能保护用户隐私。

Result: CAT框架在目标-任务对齐方面提供了前所未有的洞察力，能够更有效地优化和开发Agentic AI系统。

Conclusion: CAT框架填补了Agentic AI系统评估中的重要空白，为理解和改进任务与目标的对齐关系提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of
generative AI models. While these systems demonstrate immense potential and
power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's
tasks and its overarching goals. This paper introduces the Creative Adversarial
Testing (CAT) framework, a novel approach designed to capture and analyze the
complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

### [365] [Deceive, Detect, and Disclose: Large Language Models Play Mini-Mafia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23023)
*Davi Bastos Costa,Renato Vicente*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mini-Mafia是一个简化的四人社交推理游戏，用于评估大语言模型的社交智能，通过角色特定的胜利条件来测试欺骗、识破欺骗和信息披露能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mafia游戏的信息不对称和心智理论推理反映了现实世界多智能体场景，为评估大语言模型的社交智能提供了有用的测试平台。

Method: 引入Mini-Mafia：简化版四人游戏（1黑手党、1侦探、2村民），设置黑手党杀死村民、侦探调查黑手党的夜间行动，减少到单一讨论和投票阶段。通过LLM互相对战创建基准测试框架。

Result: 实验显示反直觉结果，包括较小模型有时表现优于较大模型。基准测试还支持研究多智能体动态，如名称偏见和最后发言者优势。

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia不仅用于基准测试，还支持AI安全研究，生成欺骗检测器训练数据，并跟踪模型相对于人类基线的欺骗能力。

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了Kimi-Dev方法，通过Agentless训练获得结构化技能先验，然后迁移到SWE-Agent框架中，在SWE-bench上取得优异表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SWE解决方案分为多轮交互的SWE-Agent框架和单步验证的Agentless方法，作者认为这两种范式并非互斥，Agentless训练可以获得技能先验来提升SWE-Agent性能

Method: 首先制定Agentless训练方法，开发Kimi-Dev模型；然后在5k公开轨迹上进行SFT适配，将技能迁移到SWE-Agent框架

Result: Kimi-Dev在SWE-bench Verified上达到60.4%，是工作流方法中最佳；适配后的SWE-Agent达到48.6% pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet相当

Conclusion: Agentless训练的结构化技能先验可以桥接工作流和智能体框架，实现可迁移的编码智能体

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

*Yikai Wang,Xiaocheng Li,Guanting Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个评估和调控大语言模型风险偏好的新方法，发现指令微调模型符合标准效用理论，而预训练和RLHF对齐模型偏离效用模型，且后训练是最有效的风险偏好调控方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在不确定性决策任务中应用日益广泛，但其风险特征以及提示和训练方法对其影响尚未充分研究，现有研究主要关注个性提示或多智能体交互，缺乏对后训练如何影响LLM风险行为的探讨。

Method: 提出基于行为经济学和金融学工具的新流程来激发、引导和调控LLM风险特征，使用效用理论模型比较预训练、指令微调和RLHF对齐的LLM，并评估提示工程、上下文学习和后训练等调控策略。

Result: 指令微调模型表现出与标准效用公式一致的行为，而预训练和RLHF对齐模型更偏离拟合的效用模型；后训练提供了最稳定有效的风险偏好调控。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了不同类别和阶段LLM的风险特征，展示了后训练如何调控这些特征，为行为对齐和风险感知LLM设计的未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and
demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork
for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

*Fang Wu,Xu Huang,Weihao Xuan,Zhiwei Zhang,Yijia Xiao,Guancheng Wan,Xiaomin Li,Bing Hu,Peng Xia,Jure Leskovec,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了MNPO（多人纳什偏好优化）框架，将NLHF从双人博弈扩展到多人博弈，以更好地处理现实世界中非传递性和异质性的人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于奖励的方法（如RLHF）在Bradley-Terry假设下难以捕捉真实偏好的非传递性和异质性特征。虽然NLHF将对齐问题重新定义为双人纳什博弈，但仍受限于双人交互，存在单一对手偏差，无法充分反映复杂偏好结构。

Method: MNPO将对齐问题建模为n人博弈，每个策略与对手群体竞争，同时向参考模型正则化。该框架建立了多人设置中的纳什均衡，并扩展了对偶间隙概念来量化近似质量。

Result: 实验表明MNPO在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于现有NLHF基线，在异质性标注条件和混合策略评估场景下实现了更优的对齐质量。

Conclusion: MNPO为对齐LLM与复杂、非传递性人类偏好提供了一个原则性和可扩展的框架，继承了双人方法的均衡保证，同时实现了更丰富的竞争动态和偏好结构覆盖。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

*Morgan McCarty,Jorge Morales*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过创建经典心理意象任务的新项目来评估LLMs的复杂认知能力，发现最佳LLMs在纯文本条件下表现优于人类平均水平，挑战了此类任务必须依赖视觉心理意象的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上大型语言模型在训练数据包含的任务和纯语言任务上表现最佳，这限制了对其涌现的复杂认知能力的理解。本研究旨在测试LLMs是否能够完成认知心理学中认为必须依赖视觉心理意象的任务。

Method: 创建了数十个经典心理意象任务的新项目，首先测试多个最先进的纯文本LLMs，要求它们根据书面指令报告变换后的结果；然后测试100名人类受试者建立基线；最后测试不同推理级别的推理模型。

Result: 最佳LLMs的表现显著高于人类平均水平，当模型分配更多推理token时表现最强。这表明最佳LLMs可能具备完成依赖意象任务的能力，尽管其架构是非图像性的。

Conclusion: 研究不仅证明了LLMs在执行新任务时涌现的认知能力，还重新引发了关于人类视觉意象表征形式的辩论，表明命题推理（或至少非图像推理）可能足以完成长期被认为依赖意象的任务。

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

*Junyang Zhang,Tianyi Zhu,Thierry Tambe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Attention Anchor框架，通过跨模态语义分组改善视觉语言模型的注意力机制，减少幻觉并提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型依赖直接拼接图像和文本token，导致跨模态语义相关token之间距离过远，造成幻觉和性能下降

Method: 提出参数自由的Attention Anchor框架，将语义相似的跨模态token分组，在相关视觉块附近插入文本token作为语义路标

Result: 在15个指标中的13个取得改进，推理任务提升达32%，幻觉基准提升达15%，TinyLLaVA 1B在POPE上超越LLaVA 7B和QwenVL 3B

Conclusion: Attention Anchor通过跨模态token分组有效改善注意力机制，是首个研究混合模态token分组的工作

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups
rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc
with additional alignment losses.

Motivation: 利用LLM系统在传感器丰富的工业环境中实现自主健康监测，直接从传感器数据中检测和分类故障，并通过自然语言推理产生可解释的输出。

Method: 系统评估了LLM系统架构（单LLM vs 多LLM）、输入表示（原始数据 vs 描述性统计）和上下文窗口大小对诊断性能的影响。

Result: LLM系统在提供汇总统计输入时表现最佳，使用专门提示的多LLM系统在故障分类方面比单LLM系统具有更高的灵敏度。LLM能够产生详细且人类可读的决策理由，但在持续学习环境中适应能力有限。

Conclusion: LLM系统作为复杂环境中透明、自适应诊断工具具有前景，但目前仍存在局限性，特别是在持续学习设置中的预测校准方面。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based
systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating
the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception
and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in
AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA
models met the industrial requirements? In this paper, from the perspective of
industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art
VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models
for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection
and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their
ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex
industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high precision placing
tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA
models for industrial use and highlight the need for task-specific enhancements
to improve their robustness, generalization, and precision.

Motivation: 形式化模型对于指定和验证大型复杂计算机系统至关重要，但编写和维护成本高昂。现有AI方法主要针对小型代码而非完整系统，需要评估AI处理真实系统组件的能力。

Method: 创建SysMoBench基准测试，专注于并发和分布式系统，使用TLA+规范语言，自动化评估语法正确性、运行时正确性、系统代码一致性、不变式正确性等指标。

Result: 基准测试目前包含9个多样化系统组件（如Etcd的Raft实现、Redis、Asterinas OS的Spinlock和Mutex等），正在积极添加更多组件。

Conclusion: SysMoBench有助于理解当前LLM和智能体的能力与局限，为该领域工具奠定坚实基础并开辟新的研究方向。

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性准确率评估无法揭示模型在数学推理中的系统性问题，需要更精细的动态诊断方法来评估推理的保真度和一致性。

Method: 将参数化问题视为系统，对单个参数进行正弦驱动，拟合模型输出和精确解的一阶谐波响应，获得增益（幅度跟踪）和相位（滞后）等频率分辨指标。

Result: 在五个闭式问题族中，诊断揭示了系统性的低通行为和增长的相位滞后，这些现象被准确率评估所掩盖。结果区分了前沿模型和中层模型的动态性能。

Conclusion: MathBode提供了一个紧凑、可复现的协议，通过可操作的推理保真度和一致性测量来补充标准基准测试，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

Motivation: 研究多智能体系统中协调的基本热力学约束，解释为什么协调需要信息压缩，以及这如何导致系统出现亚稳态和滞后现象。

Method: 使用信息论方法推导协调协议的最小描述长度，定义协调温度来预测临界现象，并扩展Arrow定理的拓扑版本。

Result: 发现协调协议的最小描述长度随智能体数量和目标复杂度呈多项式增长，这迫使系统进行渐进简化，产生持久亚稳态和滞后效应。

Conclusion: 协调本质上需要激进的信息损失，这解释了多目标梯度下降中的无限循环和大型语言模型中的对齐伪装现象。

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Conclusion: 该AI优化框架成功解决了Wi-Fi密集部署中的碰撞和公平性问题，为下一代无线网络提供了可行的信道接入改进方案。

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

mechanism remains widely open. In this paper we propose a set of information
propagation rules based on Transformers and utilize symbolic reasoning tasks to
theoretically analyze the limit reasoning steps. We show that the limit number
of reasoning steps is between $O(3^{L-1})$ and $O(2^{L-1})$ for a model with
$L$ attention layers in a single-pass.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多令牌预测(MTP)范式对传递关系学习的影响，提出了增强转移层的方法来提升模型在复杂规划任务中的路径规划能力。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂规划任务中难以学习传递关系，这是复杂规划的基石问题。

Method: 使用共享输出头和转移层的Transformer架构进行理论分析，提出Next-Token注入和基于Transformer的转移层两种增强策略。

Result: 在合成图和Blocksworld规划基准上的实验验证了理论发现，改进显著提升了模型的路径规划能力。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对Transformer在复杂规划任务中学习机制的理解，为克服传递性瓶颈提供了实用策略，推动了结构感知的通用规划模型发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

TL;DR: AutoEP是一个无需训练的自动超参数配置框架，利用大语言模型作为零样本推理引擎，结合在线景观分析提供实时反馈，在组合优化基准测试中优于现有调优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于学习的超参数配置方法存在样本复杂度高和泛化能力差的问题，需要一种无需训练、能实时适应搜索动态的自动化解决方案。

Method: 结合在线探索性景观分析模块提供实时定量反馈，与多LLM推理链解释反馈并生成自适应超参数策略，将高层推理与经验数据相结合。

Result: 在三种不同元启发式算法和多样化组合优化基准测试中，AutoEP持续优于最先进的调优器，包括神经进化和其他基于LLM的方法，且开源模型能达到GPT-4的性能水平。

Conclusion: AutoEP展示了一种强大且易于使用的自动超参数设计新范式，通过将LLM推理与实时经验反馈相结合，实现了无需训练的高效算法控制。

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and
accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design. Our code is

*Runyan Tan,Shuang Wu,Phillip Howard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为p-less采样的无超参数解码策略，通过信息论方法动态设置截断阈值，在高温条件下仍能保持高质量输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有采样方法的性能对超参数选择敏感，且在不同生成任务和温度配置下需要不同设置。

Method: 基于信息论的p-less采样方法，在每个解码步骤根据整个token概率分布动态设置截断阈值，无需超参数。

Result: 在数学、逻辑推理和创意写作任务中，p-less采样始终优于现有采样方法，在高温下文本质量下降更少，推理效率更高。

Conclusion: p-less采样是一种有效的无超参数解码策略，在保持高质量输出的同时提高了推理效率。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

### [382] [Training Vision-Language Process Reward Models for Test-Time Scaling in Multimodal Reasoning: Key Insights and Lessons Learned](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23250)
*Brandon Ong,Tej Deep Pala,Vernon Toh,William Chandra Tjhi,Soujanya Poria*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个用于视觉语言模型的过程奖励模型（VL-PRM）设计框架，包含混合数据合成、感知监督和测试时扩展策略，在多个多模态基准测试中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言过程奖励模型（VL-PRM）主要依赖蒙特卡洛树搜索进行数据构建，会产生噪声监督信号并限制跨任务泛化能力，需要探索更有效的VL-PRM设计方法。

Method: 提出混合数据合成框架（结合MCTS和强VLM判断）、感知聚焦监督（显式检测视觉推理阶段的错误）以及系统评估多种测试时扩展策略。

Result: 在五个多模态基准测试上的实验表明：VL-PRM作为结果奖励模型在测试时扩展中表现更优；小模型能匹配或超越大模型；VL-PRM能挖掘强VLM的潜在推理能力；感知监督带来显著增益；在数学推理数据集上性能提升明显。

Conclusion: 该工作为VL-PRM设计提供了系统指导，有望推动视觉语言模型的进一步发展，特别是在可靠推理能力方面。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GUI-PRA是一个针对GUI任务的流程奖励代理，通过动态记忆机制和自适应UI感知来解决标准流程奖励模型在GUI领域中的"中间迷失"问题和缺乏UI变化感知的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI代理在处理长时程任务时经常失败，标准流程奖励模型在处理密集人工输入和长历史数据时存在"中间迷失"现象，且缺乏对GUI动态变化的感知能力。

Method: 提出GUI-PRA，包含动态记忆机制（相关性检索模块和渐进式总结模块）和自适应UI感知机制，能够智能处理历史上下文并主动感知UI状态变化。

Result: GUI-PRA能够更好地提供流程奖励，通过聚焦相关上下文和基于当前UI环境的评估，提升GUI代理在长时程任务中的表现。

Conclusion: GUI-PRA通过解决历史上下文处理和UI变化感知的关键挑战，为GUI任务中的流程奖励建模提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

Motivation: 研究现代社会经济系统与人工智能技术深度融合背景下，AI协作在资源约束条件下对社会总产出的影响机制。

Method: 构建五个逐步扩展的异质代理模型：纯人类协作基准模型、引入AI协作模型、加入代理网络效应模型、代理作为独立生产者模型、整合网络效应和独立生产的综合模型。

Result: AI代理引入显著增加社会总产出；考虑网络效应时，增长呈现远超个体贡献简单加总的非线性增长；相同资源投入下，独立生产者模式具有更高长期增长潜力；网络效应进一步展现出强规模报酬递增特性。

Conclusion: AI协作在资源约束下能有效提升社会总产出，网络效应和独立生产者模式是推动非线性增长和长期发展潜力的关键因素。

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成推理方法存在工具使用不足或过度、工具调用后过度思考等问题，需要激励LLM高效准确地进行TIR并稳定推理过程。

Method: 基于信息熵分析工具调用对推理的影响，提出包含数据集构建和多阶段微调的框架：采用连续自演化采样（普通采样+熵引导采样）构建数据集，通过两阶段训练（监督微调+自演化直接偏好优化）。

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验结果表明，Tool-Light显著提高了模型执行TIR任务的效率。

Conclusion: Tool-Light框架通过信息熵分析和多阶段微调，有效提升了LLM在工具集成推理中的性能和效率。

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in
executing TIR tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段的模式感知框架，通过整合计算器模式和算法模式来改进工具集成推理，显著提升了代码使用和数学问题解答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成推理研究主要关注何时调用工具，而忽视了如何应用工具。作者发现计算器模式和算法模式的选择不当会导致推理失败，即使推理过程本身是正确的。

Method: 提出了两阶段框架：首先从两种模式中构建代码能力，然后将模式选择与教师偏好对齐。

Result: 在挑战性数学数据集上，模式感知方法显著提升了代码使用和准确性，例如在MATH500上Code@1从64.0%提升到70.5%，在AIME24上从26.7%提升到50.0%。

Conclusion: 模式感知方法对于工具集成推理非常有效，强调了正确选择工具应用模式的重要性。

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

<details>

Motivation: 大型推理模型在深度推理时计算成本高昂，现有强化学习方法难以在推理过程中构建短路径，限制了有效学习

Method: 基于证据积累模型的洞察，训练模型主动终止冗余推理；在推理过程中进行轨迹截断，使模型接触分布一致的短推理路径；使用质量控制的长度奖励来鼓励简洁推理

Result: JET显著提高了推理效率而不牺牲准确性，DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B在奥林匹克基准上准确率提升4.6%，输出长度减少46.3%

Conclusion: JET方法通过主动终止冗余推理，有效解决了大型推理模型的效率问题，实现了准确性与效率的平衡

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在电子健康记录数据访问中缺乏能够捕捉真实临床数据访问流程的基准，实际部署面临查询模糊性和术语不匹配两大挑战。

Method: 引入EHR-ChatQA基准，在模拟环境中使用LLM用户评估代理的端到端工作流程，包括两种交互流程：增量查询精炼和自适应查询精炼。

Result: 实验显示代理在IncreQA上Pass@5达到90-95%，AdaptQA上60-80%，但Pass^5（五轮试验全部成功）显著降低35-60%，表明一致性不足。

Conclusion: 需要构建不仅性能好而且鲁棒的代理来满足电子健康记录领域的安全关键需求，同时提供了常见失败模式的诊断见解。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

Conclusion: 该方法证明准确性、可扩展性和可解释性可以共存，为二进制代码相似性检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

*Zhuoli Yin,Yi Ding,Reem Khir,Hua Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ViTSP是一个新颖框架，利用预训练视觉语言模型通过可视化方式指导大规模旅行商问题的求解过程，无需专门训练即可在1k到88k节点实例上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统精确方法难以扩展，启发式方法需要参数调优，而现有学习方法泛化性差且可扩展性有限。需要一种无需专门训练就能有效解决大规模TSP的方法。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型从可视化的TSP实例中识别有前景的小规模子问题，然后用现成求解器高效优化这些子问题来改进全局解。

Result: 在1k到88k节点的真实世界TSP实例上，ViTSP平均最优性差距低于0.2%，优于现有学习方法，在相同运行时间预算下比最佳启发式求解器LKH-3的差距减少12%到100%。

Conclusion: 该框架为混合预训练生成模型和运筹学求解器解决组合优化问题提供了新视角，具有集成到更复杂物流系统的实际意义。

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个信息论框架GeoBS来评估AI模型中的地理偏见，该框架具有模型无关性和空间显式特性，能够公平比较不同模型的偏见并理解空间因素的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型特别是基础模型的广泛应用带来了显著的地理偏见问题，但现有评估方法要么是模型特定的，要么是空间隐式的，缺乏一个通用且空间显式的评估框架。

Method: 建立信息论框架GeoBS，提出三种新的地理偏见评分，明确考虑多尺度性、距离衰减和各向异性等复杂空间因素。

Result: 在3个任务、8个数据集和8个模型上的广泛实验表明，任务特定的GeoAI模型和通用基础模型都可能存在各种类型的地理偏见。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅推进了对地理偏见的技术理解，还为将空间公平性整合到AI系统的设计、部署和评估中奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

Motivation: 解决教育不平等问题，通过开发可扩展的AI辅导系统，特别是在数据稀疏环境下提高学生答题正确率的预测准确性。

Method: 引入基于项目反应理论的概率建模框架，结合主题级技能画像的协同过滤模型，并开发了新颖的离散变分推理框架。

Result: 在数学考试预测中实现了超过80%的准确率，创下了新的基准，并在低数据设置下超越了所有经典的IRT和矩阵分解基线方法。

Conclusion: 单一潜在能力参数足以实现最大预测准确性，离散变分推理框架在低数据环境下表现最佳，为AI辅导系统提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发了容量熟悉度签名来表征大语言模型基准测试及其有意义的重叠。基准签名通过从真实语料中提取的关键词集来探测基准性能所需的模型能力，这些关键词的困惑度能高度预测模型在基准测试中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试存在性能与能力混淆、泛化能力评估不足等问题，需要一种更机制化的方法来理解基准测试的有效性和模型能力之间的内在联系。

Method: 通过大规模元评估，在32个LLM和88个基准测试上使用逐步前向选择和线性回归提取基准签名，涵盖知识、编码、逻辑、数学、推理等多个领域。

Result: 发现知识推理子任务存在重叠，多语言和文化基准相似度较低，性能结果受基准正交因素影响，但基准签名对这些影响保持稳健。编码领域重叠度最低。

Conclusion: 基准签名为理解基准有效性和LLM敏感性提供了机制性洞察，揭示了LLM能力之间的内在联系，有助于解决当前基准评估中的局限性。

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于情境赌博机的动态信任校准方法，通过标准化信任校准指标来客观测量人机协作中的信任水平，在三个数据集上验证了该方法能显著提升决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏客观标准化的方法来测量人机协作中的信任校准。过度信任会导致盲目接受AI输出，信任不足则会忽略AI的有价值见解，影响决策性能。

Method: 使用情境赌博机算法，这是一种能够结合情境信息进行自适应决策的算法，通过动态评估何时信任AI贡献来构建信任校准指标。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的评估显示，有效的信任校准能够显著提升决策性能，奖励指标提高了10-38%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了理论理解，还为开发更可信的AI系统提供了实践指导，特别是在疾病诊断和刑事司法等关键领域。

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用LLM自身作为裁判来评估模型性能的方法，该方法与人类评估的Elo分数有91%的相关性，可以低成本替代昂贵的人工评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新LLM不断发布，但参数量与性能不成正比，需要独立评估方法。当前基于人类比较的Elo评分方法成本高昂。

Method: 使用LLM作为裁判来比较模型输出，通过统计LLM一致选择某个模型为最佳的概率来生成评估指标。

Result: 该方法生成的指标与人类评估的Elo分数有91%的相关性，能够有效预测模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单、廉价的Elo分数替代方案，无需人类数据或先验知识即可评估LLM性能。

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

TL;DR: 多轮多智能体编排通过多个LLM智能体迭代提出答案或投票达成共识，在三个基准测试中匹配或超越最强单模型，分析显示有进一步改进潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体编排是否能通过协作提升LLM性能，探索不同编排设置对共识达成过程的影响。

Method: 使用四个LLM在三个基准测试上进行实验：比较编排与单模型基线，并在GPQA-Diamond上进行消融研究，分析作者身份可见性和实时投票可见性的影响。

Result: 编排方法匹配或超越最强单模型，始终优于其他模型。显示作者身份会增加自投票和平局，显示实时投票会放大从众效应，加速收敛但可能导致过早共识。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排是提升LLM性能的有效方法，但编排机制设计需要平衡收敛速度与共识质量，避免信息偏差带来的负面影响。

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

Motivation: 大型语言模型引入了新的安全挑战，特别是提示越狱攻击，需要发现LLM对齐方法中的漏洞。

Method: 使用强化学习将越狱提示形式化，构建GraphRAG系统，利用提取的相关术语和形式化符号作为上下文输入。

Result: 在常见开源模型上进行了广泛实验，证明了攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: PASS框架能够有效发现和利用LLM对齐方法的漏洞，实现更有效的越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

Motivation: 现有中医AI处方推荐研究主要关注症状-草药关系，但存在三个限制：患者个性化信息关注不足、草药数据长尾分布导致训练偏差、忽略君臣佐使配伍原则增加毒副作用风险。

Method: 使用患者个性化提示序列预训练症状表示，应用提示导向对比学习进行数据增强；采用知识图谱引导的同构图扩散方法与自注意力机制全局捕捉非线性症状-草药关系；设计异构图分层网络整合草药配伍关系与隐式证候。

Result: 在两个公共数据集和一个临床数据集上的广泛实验证明了TCM-HEDPR的有效性，并结合现代医学和网络药理学全面评估推荐处方。

Conclusion: 该模型为现代中医推荐提供了新范式，能够更好地遵循中医辨证论治原则，提高处方推荐准确性和安全性。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

Conclusion: 该基准为通过改善数据质量来提升LLM对齐提供了原则性和可复现的方法，强调了数据预处理在负责任AI开发中的重要作用。

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

Motivation: 扩散模型在自动驾驶中能捕捉多模态驾驶行为，但在反应式闭环环境中难以有效引导。现有基于锚点的方法使用截断调度，存在理论不一致性和性能问题。

Method: 提出BridgeDrive，一种锚点引导的扩散桥策略，提供原则性扩散框架将锚点转化为细粒度轨迹规划，兼容高效ODE求解器。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中达到最先进性能，成功率比现有方法提高5%。

Conclusion: BridgeDrive为闭环轨迹规划提供了有效的锚点引导扩散框架，在复杂动态驾驶场景中表现优异，适合实时自动驾驶部署。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理护栏存在两大根本限制：对所有用户应用统一策略，忽略了个体差异；孤立检查每个响应，未能追踪跨轮次风险累积。

Method: PSG-Agent通过挖掘交互历史中的稳定特征和实时查询状态创建个性化护栏，并在代理流水线中实施持续监控，包括计划监控器、工具防火墙、响应守卫和记忆守护者等专门守卫。

Result: 在医疗、金融和日常生活自动化等多个场景中验证，PSG-Agent显著优于LlamaGuard3和AGrail等现有代理护栏。

Conclusion: PSG-Agent为LLM代理的个性化安全提供了一条可执行且可审计的路径。

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,
PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with
specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,
Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable
verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including
healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user
profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including
LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward
personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

Result: 在一系列具有挑战性的推理基准测试中，该方法在准确性和逻辑一致性方面显著优于最先进的蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为创建真正具有推理能力而非仅能流利模仿的小型模型提供了一条可行路径。

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,
not just fluent mimics.

Motivation: 理解RLVR训练中出现的两阶段学习曲线、V形响应长度轨迹和灾难性遗忘等令人困惑的现象，并寻求统一解释。

Method: 提出语义复杂网络自组织理论，认为模型推理过程映射到稀疏拓扑网络；基于此开发Annealed-RLVR算法，在最大挫折点引入SFT加热步骤。

Result: 在15亿参数模型上的实验表明，该方法在分布内和分布外基准测试中均优于标准RLVR。

Conclusion: 通过将RLVR重新解释为结构自组织的可预测过程，为未来AI系统推理能力的工程化提供了新的物理直觉。

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

Motivation: 大型推理模型生成显式推理轨迹和最终答案，但这些推理轨迹在多大程度上影响答案生成尚不清楚，需要深入研究推理与答案生成之间的相互作用。

Method: 采用三阶段研究方法：1）实证评估推理对答案质量的影响；2）注意力分析识别推理焦点头；3）通过激活修补进行机制干预，评估答案标记对推理激活的依赖性。

Result: 包含显式推理能一致提升各领域答案质量；答案标记显著关注推理标记，特定中间层推理焦点头能追踪推理轨迹；关键推理标记的扰动可可靠改变最终答案。

Conclusion: 研究证实了从推理到答案的方向性功能信息流，深化了对大型推理模型如何利用推理标记进行答案生成的理解，突出了中间推理在塑造模型输出中的功能性作用。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索代理连接LLMs与互联网，虽然能获取更广泛和更新的信息，但不可靠的搜索结果可能对终端用户构成安全威胁，建立了一个新的威胁面。

Method: 提出了一个系统化、可扩展且成本效益高的自动化红队框架，构建了包含300个测试用例的SafeSearch基准，涵盖五类风险类别，评估了三种代表性搜索代理支架。

Result: 评估结果显示LLM搜索代理存在严重漏洞：当暴露于不可靠网站时，GPT-4.1-mini在搜索工作流设置下的最高攻击成功率达到了90.5%。常见防御实践（如提醒提示）效果有限。

Conclusion: 该框架在促进更安全的代理开发透明度方面具有重要价值，强调了搜索代理安全评估的必要性。

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases

### [409] [Measuring Sparse Autoencoder Feature Sensitivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23717)
*Claire Tian,Katherine Tian,Nathan Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了评估稀疏自编码器特征敏感性的可扩展方法，发现许多可解释特征敏感性较差，且特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SAE特征主要通过激活示例来表征，但这些示例无法揭示特征敏感性——即特征在类似文本上的可靠激活程度

Method: 使用语言模型生成与特征激活示例具有相同语义属性的文本，然后测试特征是否在这些生成文本上激活

Result: 敏感性衡量了特征质量的新维度，许多可解释特征敏感性较差；人类评估确认当特征在生成文本上不激活时，这些文本确实与原始激活示例相似

Conclusion: 特征敏感性是评估单个特征和SAE架构的新维度，平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了MedLA框架，一种基于逻辑驱动的多智能体系统，通过显式逻辑树和前提级对齐实现透明推理，在医学问答任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体方法依赖固定角色或浅层交互提示，难以检测和解决细粒度逻辑不一致问题。

Method: 每个智能体基于三段论（大前提、小前提、结论）构建显式逻辑树，通过多轮图引导讨论比较和迭代优化逻辑树，实现错误纠正和矛盾解决。

Result: 在MedDDx和标准医学QA基准测试中，MedLA持续优于静态角色系统和单智能体基线，在不同LLM骨干上均实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: MedLA提供了一个可推广的范式，用于可信赖的医学推理，能够有效扩展至开源和商业LLM骨干。

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm
for trustworthy medical reasoning.

Result: 在AIME 2024、AIME 2025和AIMO 2025等数学推理基准测试中，EAPO优于专家协助工作流、专家蒸馏模型和RL基线，平均比自探索模型提高5分。

Conclusion: EAPO通过专家协助有效增强了LLM的推理能力，在评估时模型能够独立产生改进的推理路径和更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

Conclusion: 本文为平台编排智能体系统提供了可靠的失败根因数据集、分类法和基准测试，为开发更可靠的智能体系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

Motivation: 解决长序列GUI任务中稀疏奖励和难以进行信用分配的问题，这些因素阻碍了自主代理的发展。

Method: 开发GUI-Shepherd过程奖励模型，基于包含52k次交互的大规模数据集训练，该数据集包含人工标注分数和GPT-4o生成的解释。模型可作为RL训练中的奖励提供者和推理时的验证器。

Conclusion: 高质量的过程监督对于构建更强大的GUI代理至关重要，GUI-Shepherd提供了一个通用解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous agents for long-sequence Graphical User Interface tasks are
hindered by sparse rewards and the intractable credit assignment problem. To
address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is

this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric
representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The
game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and
discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable

standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM
and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate
competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with
a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where
participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and
trustworthy.

Conclusion: 为科学发现中的可解释AI建立了新范式。

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large
language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电商代理基准缺乏评估处理混合类型电商对话和复杂领域规则的能力，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 基于真实客服对话构建Mix-ECom语料库，经过隐私处理和CoT流程添加，建立基线并提出动态框架提升性能。

Result: 结果显示当前电商代理在处理电商对话时能力不足，主要由于复杂领域规则导致的幻觉问题。

Conclusion: Mix-ECom数据集将公开可用，有助于促进电商代理的进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: AgentGuard是一个用于自主AI系统运行时验证的框架，通过动态概率保证提供连续定量保证，将代理的原始I/O抽象为形式化事件，使用在线学习构建和更新马尔可夫决策过程模型，并通过概率模型检查实时验证定量属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主AI系统的快速发展带来了重大风险，其固有的不可预测性和涌现行为使得传统验证方法不再适用，需要转向概率保证方法。

Method: 作为检查层观察代理的原始I/O，将其抽象为状态模型转换的形式化事件；使用在线学习动态构建和更新马尔可夫决策过程模型；通过概率模型检查实时验证定量属性。

Result: 提出了AgentGuard框架，实现了对自主AI系统的运行时验证，能够提供连续、定量的保证。

Conclusion: AgentGuard框架通过动态概率保证方法，为自主AI系统的验证提供了新的解决方案，能够应对传统验证方法无法处理的系统不可预测性和涌现行为问题。

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了关于结果奖励会导致错误中间步骤被强化的传统观点，揭示了结果奖励实际上能惩罚错误动作，并提出了梯度耦合是强化学习中真正的问题，通过动作分类训练来解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为基于结果的奖励会导致奖励校准错误，错误强化不良中间步骤。但本文发现结果奖励实际上能确保错误动作获得负优势，真正问题是相似样本间的梯度耦合导致错误动作被意外增强。

Method: 提出训练actor进行好坏动作分类，分离好/坏动作的嵌入表示，减轻梯度干扰。通过大量实验验证方法的有效性。

Result: 研究表明结果奖励确实能惩罚错误动作，但梯度耦合问题会导致某些错误动作被增强。提出的动作分类方法能有效缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: 结果奖励本身不会强化错误动作，真正问题在于梯度耦合。通过动作分类训练可以分离好/坏动作的嵌入，有效解决梯度干扰问题。

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

Motivation: 神经网络纤维化作为一种神经符号框架，用于在神经网络中结合学习和推理。然而，它与模态逻辑纤维化之间的确切对应关系从未被正式建立。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过形式化与纤维化神经网络兼容的纤维模型概念，建立神经网络纤维化与模态逻辑纤维化之间的对应关系。

Conclusion: 本文为使用纤维化作为形式化工具来解释神经网络学习的逻辑理论开辟了道路，将计算逻辑工具应用于神经网络解释。

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法通过奖励或优势塑造引入先验，但需要手动调整参数且方向性假设可能导致失败，需要一种不预设指标方向的方法

Method: CANON方法：基于目标指标值将采样响应分为高低两组，通过组间比较确定哪个指标趋势贡献更好性能，并在组内识别更好响应

Result: 基于熵的CANON在三个LLM上持续优于先前方法，应用于响应长度时进一步提高了token效率，在性能-成本权衡中获得更优的帕累托前沿

Conclusion: CANON方法有效增强了目标指标影响而不依赖方向性假设，在推理任务中表现优异且能改善token效率

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

Motivation: 系统文献综述中的文献搜索、筛选和分析是耗时任务，需要自动化工具来减少人工工作量，特别是通过机器学习自动筛选相关文献。

Method: 使用语法引导遗传编程构建基于规则的可解释分类器，能够结合文本信息和文献计量数据，这些数据在现有方法中未被考虑。

Result: 实验证明该方法能够生成准确且可解释的分类器，支持现有方法不支持的配置信息源。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持可解释性的同时提高了文献自动筛选的准确性，为系统文献综述提供了有效的自动化工具。

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

Conclusion: TusoAI能够自主开发优化的计算方法，加速科学发现，并在实际应用中揭示新的生物学见解。

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/Alistair-Turcan/TusoAI.

Conclusion: LLM/代理驱动的数据分析技术已产生重大影响，但仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究以推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,
programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g.,
data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the
remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for
advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.

TL;DR: 单次运行的LLM排行榜不可靠，研究发现至少需要2次重复运行才能显著提高排名稳定性，建议在随机解码下使用≥2次重复来改善模型比较的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM排行榜通常依赖单次随机运行，但需要多少次重复才能得出可靠结论尚不明确，因此重新评估多个先进模型以确定重复运行的价值。

Method: 在AI4Math基准测试上对8个最先进模型进行3次独立运行，使用混合效应逻辑回归、领域级边际均值、排名不稳定性分析和运行间可靠性评估。

Result: 单次运行排行榜很脆弱：83%的切片至少出现一次与三次运行多数结果相反的成对排名反转。两次运行可消除约83%的单次运行反转，平均运行仅带来约5%的标准误差缩减。

Conclusion: 应将评估视为实验，报告不确定性，在随机解码下使用≥2次重复运行。这些实践能提高鲁棒性，对小团队可行，并帮助模型比较与现实世界可靠性保持一致。

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended

composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating
strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Method: 提出RPO框架，使用EM算法推断每个标签正确性的后验概率，在训练损失中自适应重加权数据点。建立了任意偏好损失与对应概率模型的理论联系，可将现有对齐算法系统性地转化为鲁棒版本。

Result: RPO作为元框架显著提升了DPO、IPO、SimPO和CPO四种先进对齐算法的性能。在Mistral和Llama 3模型上，RPO增强的方法在AlpacaEval 2和Arena-Hard上分别实现了最高7.0%和5.4%的胜率提升。

Conclusion: RPO提供了一个系统性的方法来处理人类偏好数据中的噪声问题，理论上证明在完美校准模型下能收敛到真实噪声水平，实验验证了其作为鲁棒偏好对齐元框架的有效性。

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment
algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3
models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.

### [433] [Humanline: Online Alignment as Perceptual Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24207)
*Sijia Liu,Niklas Muennighoff,Kawin Ethayarajh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在线对齐方法（如GRPO）比离线对齐（如DPO）表现更好，原因是它们更好地模拟了人类对概率的感知偏差。通过将感知扭曲融入DPO/KTO/GRPO等目标函数，即使使用离线数据也能达到在线方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么在线对齐方法比离线方法表现更好，从行为经济学的角度解释这种性能差异，并寻找更高效的对齐方法。

Method: 提出humanline变体，将人类对概率的感知偏差显式地融入到DPO/KTO/GRPO等目标函数中，即使使用离线数据也能达到在线方法的性能。

Result: humanline变体即使使用离线数据，在可验证和不可验证任务上都能匹配其在线对应方法的性能。

Conclusion: 在线/离线二分法本身与最大化人类效用无关，通过模拟人类感知偏差，可以更快速、廉价、灵活地进行后训练而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

TL;DR: ELHPlan是一个基于动作链的LLM多机器人协作规划框架，通过意图绑定的动作序列作为基本规划单元，在保持任务成功率的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在多机器人协作中的基本权衡问题：声明式方法在动态环境中缺乏适应性，而迭代方法计算成本过高且难以扩展到大规模团队和复杂任务。

Method: 提出动作链作为基本规划原语，采用循环过程：1)构建意图绑定的动作序列，2)主动验证冲突和可行性，3)通过针对性机制修复问题，4)执行验证后的动作。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，ELHPlan达到可比的任务成功率，同时仅消耗最先进方法24%的token数量。

Conclusion: ELHPlan为基于LLM的多智能体规划系统建立了新的效率-效果前沿，在保持适应性的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new
efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

*Yixin He,Lumingyuan Tang*

TL;DR: FR-Ponder是一个无需修改主干模型权重的推理计算分配框架，通过潜在向量引导实现实例自适应的推理深度控制，在保持准确率的同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Best-of-N和多数投票对所有输入使用统一推理深度，导致简单问题计算浪费而复杂问题推理不足。

Method: 使用小于1M参数的控制器观察隐藏状态，通过添加预计算的引导向量来暂停或执行推理步骤，采用GRPO作为奖励信号自适应调节推理深度。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，FR-Ponder改善了计算-准确率边界，以更低FLOPs实现更好匹配的准确率，优于早期退出基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了与问题难度相关的校准计算分配，展示了可解释的引导方向，且无需修改主干模型权重。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

TL;DR: 该论文发现了语言模型融合的紧凑幂律，揭示了模型大小与专家数量之间的关系：模型容量越大，规模依赖的下限越低；而融合尾部在专家数量增加时呈现明显的收益递减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管模型融合在实践中被广泛使用，但缺乏定量规则来预测随着专家数量增加或模型规模扩大时的收益。

Method: 通过实证研究识别语言模型融合的缩放规律，分析不同架构和方法（Average、TA、TIES、DARE）下的交叉熵测量曲线。

Result: 发现了一个紧凑的幂律，该规律在领域内和跨领域都成立，能够紧密拟合各种架构和方法的测量曲线，并解释了两个稳健规律：大部分收益在早期获得，以及随着专家数量增加变异性减小。

Conclusion: 这一缩放规律使得预测性规划成为可能：估计达到目标损失所需的专家数量，决定何时停止添加专家，以及在固定预算下权衡扩展基础模型与添加专家，将融合从启发式实践转变为可计算、可规划的替代多任务训练的方法。

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在过度思考问题，产生不必要长输出和高延迟，限制了实际部署。现有提前退出机制依赖探测机制，引入检测开销限制了延迟收益和泛化能力。

Method: 受推测解码中隐藏状态使用启发，提出SpecExit框架，从轻量级草稿模型直接预测未来token和提前退出信号，避免探测开销。

Result: 相比推测解码基线，平均生成长度减少66%，端到端延迟加速2.5倍，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: 利用隐藏状态固有信号提供有效提前退出信号，表明隐藏状态在高效推理中具有更广泛用途。

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决协作任务中系统需要推断用户对队友意图假设的复杂性，需要可解释和可修正的表征方式。

Method: 将协作任务学习框架为程序合成问题，使用可编辑程序表示行为，通过配对物理动作和自然语言的演示作为统一教学、检查和修正系统逻辑的模态。

Result: 在20名用户教授多人足球战术的研究中，70%参与者成功修正学习程序以匹配其意图，90%认为修正程序很容易。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了将学习表示为程序以及在协作物理活动中支持用户教学的独特挑战，并提出了缓解策略。

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出当前LLM图推理方法的局限性，提出将推理重点从复制图算法转向设计图算法，并构建了更挑战性的GraphAlgorithm基准，提出了Simple-RTC基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM图推理方法性能不佳，主要问题在于推理重点错误地放在复制图算法而非设计图算法上，导致基础模型能力被低估。

Method: 提出Simple-RTC方法，引导LLM先设计图算法再编写代码来解决图推理任务，并构建包含239个不同图问题和3041个测试实例的GraphAlgorithm基准。

Result: Simple-RTC在现有基准上达到接近完美的准确率，在GraphAlgorithm基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini和所有先前方法。

Conclusion: 重新定向推理重点可以显著提升LLM图推理能力，Simple-RTC为未来LLM图推理研究提供了强有力的基线。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在探索困境：预训练LLM的尖锐初始策略限制了标准RL算法的探索范围，导致只能提升单解准确率(pass@1)而抑制解多样性和多解性能(pass@k)。

Method: 采用风险敏感强化学习框架，使用风险寻求目标在平均奖励和最大奖励之间插值，提出RS-GRPO算法，通过放大困难提示的学习来驱动深度探索。

Result: 在6个数学推理基准和5个不同LLM上，RS-GRPO持续改善pass@k性能，同时保持或提升pass@1准确率。

Conclusion: RS-GRPO有效解决了RLVR的探索困境，能够发现新的推理策略而不仅仅是提炼现有能力，且实现简单只需少量代码修改。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial
policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更鲁棒可靠的推理模型确立了新方向

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成(RAG)方法在知识密集型任务中表现不佳，因为信息碎片化且缺乏知识结构建模。图结构能自然建模知识关系，但LLM无法有效处理图数据。

Method: 提出QuadGraph四层抽象统一异构知识源，构建34M参数的图基础模型(GFM)联合捕获图拓扑和文本语义，与LLM集成增强推理，采用混合精度训练和分布式消息传递实现可扩展性。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，G-reasoner持续优于最先进基线，显著提升LLM推理能力，并实现了强大的效率和跨图泛化能力。

Conclusion: G-reasoner通过统一图与语言基础模型，成功解决了现有GraphRAG方法的局限性，为图结构知识推理提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

Conclusion: SCI-VerifyBench和SCI-Verifier为科学验证提供了原则性框架，既提供系统评估，又增强了LLM在科学领域的可靠性和适用性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

TL;DR: MedMMV是一个可控的多模态多智能体框架，通过多样化短推演、结构化证据图和幻觉检测器来稳定临床推理，显著提高准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在医疗基准测试中表现出色，但在早期证据解释中存在不稳定性，导致幻觉和推理轨迹分支，产生全局不一致的结论，需要开发可靠且可审计的临床推理系统。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包括多样化短推演稳定推理、结构化证据图基础中间步骤、幻觉检测器监督、组合不确定性评分器聚合候选路径。

Result: 在六个医疗基准测试中，准确率提升高达12.7%，盲法医师评估确认显著提高推理真实性且不牺牲信息内容。

Conclusion: 通过可验证的多智能体过程控制不稳定性，为高风险领域如临床决策支持部署可信AI系统提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a
verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward
deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision
support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FinTech领域LLM微调时产生的非专业或轻率回复问题，以及领域特定数据集稀缺导致的研究局限性。

Method: 1) 创建Fin-Vault多轮金融对话数据集(1,417个标注对话)；2) 开发Fin-Ally模型，集成COMET-BART常识推理、礼貌性和人机对话动态，使用DPO优化生成人类对齐的响应。

Result: 结合常识上下文使语言模型能够生成更精细、文本精确且专业基础扎实的金融指导，超越了基本的账户管理功能。

Conclusion: 该方法为FinTech领域提供了下一代AI解决方案，能够提供个性化预算、实时支出跟踪和自动化财务规划等高级功能。

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous
studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or
the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,
and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by
COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel
Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized
budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context
enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and
professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a
next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector. Dataset and codes are

TL;DR: 提出自适应蒙特卡洛搜索(AMCS)框架，通过动态节点值估计和路径扩展来高效生成过程监督数据，显著提升大语言模型的数学推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于固定预算采样策略估计推理步骤质量，在自动数据生成过程中搜索空间巨大，导致效率低下且不灵活

Method: AMCS框架在节点值估计和路径扩展层面实现自适应动态搜索：1）为不确定推理步骤分配更多样本，简单步骤使用较少样本；2）采用时间自适应策略的蒙特卡洛算法进行路径扩展，从广泛探索逐步转向最有希望方向

Result: 构建了约20万过程监督样本的MathSearch-200K数据集，Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS在MATH500上达到76.2%准确率，超越所有基线PRM。7B模型监督效果超过72B弱监督模型，在分布外问题上保持优势

Conclusion: AMCS通过自适应搜索策略显著提升了过程奖励模型的训练数据质量和效率，为增强大语言模型的复杂数学推理能力提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

TL;DR: 提出了PRISM框架，将数学推理解耦为策略规划和目标执行两个阶段，通过自适应路由策略动态选择推理方法，在多个数学推理基准测试中优于单一策略和集成基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用固定策略进行数学推理，但单一策略无法适应问题特定需求，忽视了效果与效率之间的权衡。

Method: 构建多策略偏好数据集MathStrat，训练轻量级策略适配器获得四种推理策略的置信度分布，在推理时基于预测置信度动态定制推理方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，PRISM持续优于单一策略和集成基线，不同基础模型上提升0.9%到7.6%。

Conclusion: 自适应路由方法对跨不同模型架构的数学推理任务显示出特别强的优势。

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code
is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.

TL;DR: 论文提出Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法，通过干预推理过程来确保大型推理模型的安全推理，显著降低有害内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了安全推理的重要性，即使最终回答安全，推理过程中仍可能包含有害内容，这会影响模型可信度并带来潜在风险。

Method: 提出IPO方法，通过替换合规步骤为安全触发点，构建偏好学习对来强化安全推理信号，基于过程监督解决推理安全问题。

Result: 在越狱和对抗安全基准测试中，IPO显著提升推理和回答的整体安全性，有害性相对降低超过30%，同时保持多样推理任务的优秀性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了推理过程显式对齐的重要性，为构建更安全的大型推理模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a
practical path to safer LRMs.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial systems, there is a pressing
need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous
outcomes that could be life-threatening in certain domains. With the growing
popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine
learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for
efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time
intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and
preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements
for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this
evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that
continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset
performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such
as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This
paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the
temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial
engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological
requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception
to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a
layered architecture of the digital twin technology, as well as a taxonomy of
the technology-enabled industrial engineering applications systems, middleware,
and the used Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We provide insights into these
systems for the realization of a trustworthy and efficient smart digital-twin
industrial engineering ecosystem. We discuss future research directions in
digital twin for predictive maintenance in industrial engineering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型在数学领域表现优异，但由于缺乏领域特定训练数据和基于知识的学习模式，在其他领域泛化能力有限。

Method: 将学习目标从验证领域特定知识转向建模领域无关的逻辑流程，通过新颖的数据标注和训练框架关注思维链步骤间的上下文连贯性。

Result: ContextPRM在MMLU-Pro的九个非数学领域（法律、历史、哲学等）上通过加权多数投票实现了6.5%的平均准确率提升，显著优于其他数学导向的PRM模型。

Conclusion: 通过关注逻辑流程而非特定领域知识，ContextPRM在数学和非数学领域都表现出色，验证了该方法在提升模型泛化能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the
majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine
non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,
significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from
other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across
both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决约束编程中手动建模的瓶颈问题，传统被动约束获取方法容易在有限数据上过拟合，而纯主动方法查询成本高。

Method: 集成被动学习生成候选约束，基于概率置信度进行查询驱动的交互式精炼，使用子集探索机制从被拒绝候选中恢复有效子结构，最后进行主动学习确保模型完整性。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，交互式精炼阶段对实现高目标模型覆盖率和整体模型准确性至关重要，且查询复杂度可控。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据有限场景下显著推进了鲁棒且实用的约束获取技术。

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks
(D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task
Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic
network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and
selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and
integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable,
adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series
prediction. The complete code for NMT-Net is available from our GitHub

Method: EvoPH框架整合岛屿迁移模型和精英选择算法，共同进化提示和启发式算法，通过性能反馈指导进化过程。

Result: 在两个数据集（旅行商问题和装箱问题）上，EvoPH都取得了相对于最优解的最低相对误差。

Conclusion: EvoPH推进了基于LLM的自动算法设计领域，通过共同进化提示和启发式算法有效避免了局部最优问题。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast
and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model
accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent
agents.

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

TL;DR: 本文研究了通信评估中一个基本假设：成功协调是否意味着相互理解。通过信号博弈实验发现，即使协调成功，代理之间可能存在"成功的误解"，即使用不同的信号解释。这种误解难以发现和修复，只有在至少三个代理相互交互时才能确保共享解释的出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通信评估的基本假设——协调成功是否意味着相互理解，特别是在感知环境差异很大的混合群体（如人类和人工智能代理）中。

Method: 使用信号博弈实验，代理在缺乏共同观察的情况下发展新词汇信号，通过交互奖励来协调，但不观察其他代理如何使用信号。

Result: 群体总能达到最优协调水平，但有时代理使用不同的信号解释（成功的误解）。这种误解难以发现，且阻碍与新伙伴建立协调。至少三个代理相互交互是确保共享解释出现的最低条件。

Conclusion: 协调成功不一定意味着相互理解，可能存在"成功的误解"。为确保共享解释的出现，需要至少三个代理的相互交互，这是通信系统稳健性的关键条件。

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

Method: 通过分析模型的推理置信度轨迹和隐藏状态，发现可解与不可解问题在边界信号上有明显差异，提出推理表达监控和隐藏状态监控两种边界感知策略。

Result: 实验表明边界感知策略能显著提高模型可靠性和效率，在不牺牲准确率的情况下减少62.7-93.6%的token使用量。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型确实具有能力边界自我感知能力，边界感知策略能有效避免无效推理，提升推理效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Result: 在Things-EEG数据集上显著优于现有最佳EEG解码方法

Conclusion: 图学习与对比目标结合具有变革潜力，为更通用和鲁棒的神经表征铺平道路

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy,
and non-Euclidean nature. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Functional
Awareness Transformer-based Graph Archetype Contrastive Learning (SFTG)
framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the
EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that
simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics.
To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype
Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes
to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the
Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms
prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the
transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive
objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more
generalizable and robust neural representations.

Motivation: 现有研究忽视了逻辑复杂性和语义复杂性的相互作用，难以处理涉及抽象命题、模糊语境和矛盾立场等人类推理核心挑战的场景。

Method: 基于符号学方阵的多视角一阶逻辑推理框架，包含存在性导入检查和三值决策方案（真、假、不确定），并构建了RepublicQA基准数据集。

Conclusion: 符号学基础的多视角推理能显著提升大语言模型的逻辑推理性能，特别是在处理复杂语义和逻辑交互的场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

Conclusion: TSR-Suite是首个支持全面评估、数据管道和TSRM训练的时间序列推理套件，TimeOmni-1作为首个统一推理模型，在时间序列推理任务上表现出色，为实际应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要揭示全局能力电路，但无法解释模型为何对特定输入查询产生特定输出，需要更本地化、输入级别的解释方法。

Method: 引入查询电路概念，开发归一化偏差忠实度(NDF)评估指标，采用基于采样的方法高效识别稀疏但能忠实描述模型行为的电路。

Result: 在多个基准测试(IOI、算术、MMLU、ARC)中发现，模型内部存在极稀疏的查询电路，仅覆盖1.3%的连接就能恢复约60%的MMLU问题性能。

Conclusion: 查询电路为实现对语言模型处理单个输入的忠实、可扩展解释迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注数据格式转换，忽视了训练样本内部的推理复杂度，导致数据的推理潜力未被充分挖掘和利用。作者认为LLM的逻辑推理性能同时受训练数据潜力和模型认知能力的约束。

Method: 引入数据推理强度(DRI)指标来量化样本的潜在逻辑推理复杂度，通过分解和聚合逻辑结构进行分析。基于此提出重新认知优化策略，系统性地增强训练数据的逻辑推理强度，使其更好地与LLM的逻辑推理边界对齐。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在性能和泛化能力上显著优于以数据为中心的策略。在强化学习框架下的进一步验证也证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 优先考虑数据的推理复杂度而非单纯的数据规模或表面形式，对于实现LLM的完整认知潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

Motivation: 物理奥林匹克竞赛作为物理智能的严格测试平台，需要复杂的推理和多模态理解能力，但在AI研究中仍未被充分探索。现有方法主要是单模型，开源MLLM很少能达到金牌水平。

Method: 系统包含三个协同工作室：视觉工作室解释图表，逻辑工作室制定解决方案，评审工作室进行双阶段验证。通过迭代精炼循环实现协同进化，评审工作室的反馈持续指导逻辑工作室，使系统能够自我纠正并收敛到真实答案。

Conclusion: PhysicsMinions为奥林匹克级问题解决提供了一个可推广的框架，具有跨学科扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial

Motivation: 现有基准主要孤立评估理解和生成能力，无法确定统一模型是否能通过理解增强生成，或通过生成模拟促进更深理解，因此需要专门评估能力协同的基准。

Method: 构建包含10个类别32个子任务的1000个实例数据集，围绕两个核心轴：理解增强生成（需要推理指导图像生成）和生成增强理解（需要心理模拟解决推理任务），采用端到端评估和诊断性分步评估的双重协议。

Result: 对12个领先统一模型和6个专业基线的评估表明，当前统一模型仍难以实现有效协同，表明仅靠架构统一是不够的。

Conclusion: 需要新的训练策略和归纳偏置来充分释放统一建模的潜力，架构统一本身不足以实现理解与生成能力的有效协同。

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

Conclusion: 语义嵌入能有效复制传统心理测量结构，在成本、可扩展性和灵活性方面具有显著优势

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

Motivation: 解决规范性理论与数据驱动方法结合时的困难，包括理论间仲裁和作为归纳偏置改进数据拟合的挑战。

Method: 使用自适应深度核高斯过程，在规范性理论生成的合成数据上进行元学习，获得理论知情核函数。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经科学及其他领域提供了更通用、可扩展和自动化的理论知识与数据驱动科学探究集成方法。

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional
data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.
This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for
integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in
neuroscience and beyond.

Result: 实验结果揭示了现有模型和多智能体系统架构的优势、局限性和潜在改进领域。

Conclusion: MASLegalBench填补了法律领域多智能体系统评估方法的空白，为评估和改进法律多智能体系统提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

Motivation: V2X协同感知系统虽然能解决单智能体感知的局限，但由于其复杂的组成（多样传感器类型、融合方案、通信条件），存在许多运行挑战，且错误类型和原因尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过大规模系统评估，识别和分析协同感知系统中的6种常见错误模式，系统评估关键组件性能，包括不同通信配置和融合方案的对比。

Result: 发现：(1)基于LiDAR的协作配置感知性能最佳；(2)V2I和V2V在不同融合方案下表现不同；(3)协同感知错误增加会导致更多驾驶违规；(4)系统在在线运行时对通信干扰不鲁棒。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协同感知系统关键组件的潜在风险和脆弱性，希望发现能促进系统的设计和修复。

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学发现过程需要观察、分析和假设生成的循环，目前机器学习主要解决单个环节，但难以实现完全自动化的开放式探索。

Method: 利用大语言模型的工具使用能力，通过代码执行等最小工具集，在未知物理系统中进行自由形式探索，无需领域特定蓝图。

Conclusion: 该方法为其他领域的科学探索开辟了道路，无需微调或任务特定指令即可实现有效探索。

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线强化学习与可验证奖励方法对所有训练样本采用统一处理，忽视了问题难度与模型当前能力之间的巨大差异，导致学习效率低下和性能上限受限。

Method: CLPO算法利用模型自身rollout性能进行实时难度评估，构建在线课程，并通过自适应问题重构机制，让模型作为自己的老师：多样化中等难度问题以促进泛化，简化挑战性问题以使其更易掌握。

Result: 在八个具有挑战性的数学和通用推理基准测试中，CLPO实现了最先进的性能，平均pass@1比其它方法提高了6.96%。

Conclusion: CLPO将静态训练过程转变为与模型能力共同演化的动态过程，证明了其能够更有效地训练更具能力的推理模型。

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注或有限环境信息的MLLM提示，成本高且可扩展性差，导致任务覆盖范围有限。需要高质量、多样化、可行且可验证的下游代理任务数据集。

Method: AutoPlay采用两阶段方法：探索阶段使用MLLM探索代理系统发现新环境状态和功能；任务生成阶段利用探索轨迹和任务指南提示合成多样化、可执行且可验证的任务。

Result: 在20个Android应用中生成20k任务，在13个Ubuntu应用中生成10k任务。使用这些任务训练的UI代理在移动使用场景中成功率提高20.0%，在计算机使用场景中提高10.9%。结合MLLM验证器奖励的强化学习训练带来额外5.7%的提升。

Conclusion: AutoPlay为后训练有能力的MLLM代理提供了一种可扩展的方法，显著减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks
across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use
agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration
synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and
verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success
rates up to $20.0\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In
addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards
enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an
additional $5.7\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a
scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on
human annotation.

Motivation: 当前深度强化学习方法依赖大量经验且知识表示不透明，需要更通用、可解释的智能体，能够通过显式推理构建对环境的理解。

Method: CEL采用交互-反思循环：每次游戏后分析完整轨迹，进行规则归纳（提炼环境动态模型）和策略总结（将经验转化为可操作的策略手册）。

Result: 在扫雷、冰冻湖和推箱子等网格世界任务中，CEL智能体成功掌握了这些游戏，从稀疏奖励中自主发现规则并制定有效策略。

Conclusion: CEL展示了一条通向更通用、可解释智能体的路径，这些智能体不仅能有效行动，还能通过显式推理构建透明且不断改进的世界模型。

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex
environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement
learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge
opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in
which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,
ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language
Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its
environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only
act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world
through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social,

hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA
(Heatwave Discovery Agent), an intelligent multi-agent system designed for

Motivation: 探讨RL在LLM后训练中的真正作用：是教授新技能还是仅仅激活现有能力，以澄清关于RL价值的争论。

Method: 开发合成框架，将技能定义为推断字符串转换函数输出的能力，研究RL如何让LLM学习未见过的函数组合h(x)=g(f(x))。

Result: RL使LLM能够学习函数组合技能，这种能力可泛化到>2个函数的组合，并能迁移到不同任务中，而相同数据的next-token训练无法实现这些效果。

Conclusion: RL确实能教授LLMs真正的新技能，建议先构建具有基础技能的基座模型，然后使用RL激励高级、可泛化的技能来解决复杂问题。

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

Result: 在WildChat对话数据上训练，两种RLHI变体在个性化和指令遵循方面均优于强基线，类似反馈还能提升推理基准性能。

Conclusion: 有机人类交互为个性化对齐提供了可扩展且有效的监督方式。

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型智能体在持续现实世界角色中无法从积累的交互历史中学习的问题，避免重复过去的错误和丢弃有价值的见解。

Method: ReasoningBank框架：从智能体自我判断的成功和失败经验中提取推理策略；MaTTS：通过扩展智能体的交互经验来加速和多样化学习过程，生成丰富多样的经验用于合成更高质量的记忆。

Conclusion: 确立了内存驱动的经验扩展作为一个新的扩展维度，使智能体能够自我进化并自然产生涌现行为。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

Method: 通过几何推理、感知枚举和心理旋转三个领域的任务，比较人类和VLM表现，用人类反应时间作为串行处理需求的代理指标

Result: 所有领域都显示一致模式：VLM准确率下降与人类反应时间增加强相关，串行处理需求越高，VLM与人类性能差距越大

Conclusion: 当前VLM在串行、视觉基础的推理能力上存在根本性瓶颈，这是区别于人类的关键限制因素

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

Motivation: 传统的大语言模型对齐流程（SFT后接RL）存在关键问题：SFT使用静态专家数据，而策略演化时生成分布会漂移，导致SFT知识变得脆弱；后续的RL探索无法直接访问专家演示中的丰富知识，造成效率低下和更新不接地气。

Method: 将对齐问题重新定义为约束优化问题，提出UniAPL框架，通过单阶段统一训练目标，从混合的SFT和偏好数据批次中联合学习。在每个梯度步骤中，密集的专家演示直接接地和正则化在线探索。

Result: 在Qwen3-0.6B上性能提升5.77%（达到32B模型水平），在Qwen3-4B上提升3.75%，甚至超过了教师模型。响应长度和对数概率分布分析证实UniAPL输出更接近专家演示。

Conclusion: UniAPL通过统一训练框架有效解决了分布不匹配问题，实现了更强的性能和更好的行为对齐，证明了统一偏好学习方法的有效性。

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了LLM生成判断的检测任务，开发了J-Detector检测器，通过结合评分与候选内容特征来有效识别LLM生成的判断，并分析LLM法官的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的判断存在固有的偏见和脆弱性，在学术评审等敏感场景中需要能够区分这些判断，但现有LLM生成文本检测方法无法有效处理仅基于评分和候选内容的检测场景。

Method: 提出了J-Detector检测器，使用轻量级神经网络，结合显式提取的语言特征和LLM增强特征，将LLM法官的偏见与候选内容属性联系起来进行检测。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了J-Detector的有效性，其可解释性能够量化LLM法官的偏见，并验证了判断检测在现实场景中的实用性。

Conclusion: LLM生成判断是可检测的，J-Detector提供了一种有效的检测方法，能够识别LLM法官的偏见，对敏感应用场景具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了XGC-AVis多智能体框架，通过感知、规划、执行和反思四阶段增强多模态大模型的音视频时序对齐能力，并引入首个综合性评估基准XGC-AVQuiz，包含2685个问答对和2232个视频，涵盖PGC、UGC和AIGC内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大模型在音视频时序对齐和质量感知方面存在不足，需要开发更有效的框架和评估基准来提升这些能力。

Method: 采用四阶段多智能体框架：感知、规划、执行、反思；构建包含PGC、UGC、AIGC视频的综合性基准，引入质量感知维度评估音视频质量、同步性和连贯性。

Result: 实验表明当前MLLMs在质量感知和时序对齐任务上表现不佳，XGC-AVis无需额外训练即可提升这些能力，在两个基准上得到验证。

Conclusion: XGC-AVis框架有效提升了多模态大模型的音视频时序对齐能力，XGC-AVQuiz基准为全面评估MLLMs提供了重要工具，揭示了当前模型在质量感知方面的局限性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose XGC-AVis, a multi-agent framework that enhances the
audio-video temporal alignment capabilities of multimodal large models (MLLMs)
and improves the efficiency of retrieving key video segments through 4 stages:
perception, planning, execution, and reflection. We further introduce
XGC-AVQuiz, the first benchmark aimed at comprehensively assessing MLLMs'
understanding capabilities in both real-world and AI-generated scenarios.
XGC-AVQuiz consists of 2,685 question-answer pairs across 20 tasks, with two
key innovations: 1) AIGC Scenario Expansion: The benchmark includes 2,232
videos, comprising 1,102 professionally generated content (PGC), 753
user-generated content (UGC), and 377 AI-generated content (AIGC). These videos
cover 10 major domains and 53 fine-grained categories. 2) Quality Perception
Dimension: Beyond conventional tasks such as recognition, localization, and
reasoning, we introduce a novel quality perception dimension. This requires
MLLMs to integrate low-level sensory capabilities with high-level semantic
understanding to assess audio-visual quality, synchronization, and coherence.
Experimental results on XGC-AVQuiz demonstrate that current MLLMs struggle with
quality perception and temporal alignment tasks. XGC-AVis improves these
capabilities without requiring additional training, as validated on two
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拟声词是漫画文本交流的重要元素，具有视觉风格化特征（形状、大小、位置变化），能反映场景强度和情绪，但在漫画生成中未得到足够重视。

Method: 提出OnomatoGen方法，专注于拟声词生成，将普通文本风格化为拟声词样式。

Result: 实证研究表明拟声词生成具有独特属性，不同于典型文本风格化方法，OnomatoGen能有效将普通文本风格化为拟声词样式。

Conclusion: 拟声词生成是漫画生成中的重要研究方向，OnomatoGen方法在该领域具有有效性。

Abstract: Onomatopoeia is an important element for textual messaging in manga. Unlike
character dialogue in manga, onomatopoeic expressions are visually stylized,
with variations in shape, size, and placement that reflect the scene's
intensity and mood. Despite its important role, onomatopoeia has not received
much attention in manga generation. In this paper, we focus on onomatopoeia
generation and propose OnomatoGen, which stylizes plain text to an onomatopoeic
style. We empirically show the unique properties of onomatopoeia generation,
which differ from typical text stylization methods, and that OnomatoGen can
effectively stylize plain text in an onomatopoeia style.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了局部对抗攻击，相比全局攻击具有更低的像素扰动和更高的图像质量指标，但计算成本更高且攻击成功率略有下降。迭代方法比单步方法更能适应局部化约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击主要关注全局扰动，而局部对抗噪声的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统评估其效果、隐蔽性和计算效率。

Method: 通过引入二元掩码将噪声限制在特定区域，在FGSM、PGD和C&W等广泛使用的方法上进行局部对抗攻击评估。

Result: 局部攻击相比全局攻击实现了显著更低的平均像素扰动、更高的PSNR和SSIM，但计算成本增加且攻击成功率略有下降。迭代方法比单步方法更能保持高攻击成功率和隐蔽性指标。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了局部对抗攻击的全面分析，为推进攻击策略和设计鲁棒防御系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在上下文学习中的持续学习能力，提出了上下文持续学习(ICCL)方法，发现其具有类似人类记忆的分布练习效应，并建立了衡量与人类记忆相似度的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有大量研究关注LLM的少样本学习能力，但它们在多任务顺序到达时能否实现长期记忆保留和跨任务知识积累仍不清楚。受人类记忆研究启发，作者希望探索ICL在多任务设置中的记忆保留特性。

Method: 提出上下文持续学习(ICCL)方法，通过任务调度和提示重排实现持续学习能力。在马尔可夫链基准上测试，分析分布练习效应，并提出人类记忆相似度指标来量化CL方法与人类记忆动态的匹配程度。

Result: 实验发现特定大语言模型的ICCL受益于分布练习，存在记忆保留的"甜蜜点"。线性注意力模型如MAMBA和RWKV展现出特别类似人类的记忆模式，尽管其保留性能不如基于Transformer的LLM。

Conclusion: ICCL既具有认知合理性又具有实际有效性，提供了一个仅通过推理的持续学习范式，能够缓解灾难性遗忘并解决传统CL方法中的稳定性-可塑性困境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning
(ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast
adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner,
whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge
accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored.
Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics
of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning
(ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and
prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that,
for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice
(DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet
spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention
similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method
aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that
linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like
retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of
Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively
plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity
dilemma in conventional CL methods.

Motivation: 解决异构模型架构间协作学习的互操作性和隐私保护挑战。

Method: 采用通用融合层输出维度，将模型划分为个性化基础块和通用模块块，仅共享融合层输出以保护模型参数和架构隐私。

Result: 相比联邦学习和联邦分割学习基线，该框架实现了更优的通信效率，并在异构架构下保持稳定的训练性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了异构模型协作学习中的通信效率和隐私保护问题，为分布式学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents
significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We
propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports
model heterogeneity and enables modular composition during inference. To
facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output
dimension, which permits each model to be partitioned into a personalized base
block and a generalized modular block. Clients share their fusion-layer
outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental
results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication
efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning
(FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across
heterogeneous architectures.

*Micah Adler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了自注意力机制的关系恢复能力，推导出容量缩放定律：$D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ 是恢复 $m'$ 个关系的必要且充分条件，并提出了基于容量的多头注意力设计原理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知自注意力能学习token间的关系，但缺乏对其容量的形式化理解：在给定预算下，单层能可靠恢复多少种不同关系？

Method: 引入关系图识别(RGR)框架，将键-查询通道表示为有向图，分析在给定上下文下恢复每个项目邻居的能力。通过信息论下界和显式构造证明容量缩放定律。

Result: 推导出容量缩放定律 $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$，实验验证了性能阈值与预测容量缩放匹配，并证实将 $D_K$ 分配到多个小头能减轻干扰，增加可恢复关系数。

Conclusion: 结果为自注意力容量提供了具体的缩放定律，并为跨头分配键-查询预算提供了原则性设计规则。

Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a
formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single
layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the
key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges,
and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We
measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this
framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it
empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both
necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit
construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This
scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head
attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.
When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a
permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >
d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating
interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows
that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this
interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled
single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance
threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit
of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention
capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across
heads.

Conclusion: 表格模型对对抗扰动存在严重脆弱性，现实世界决策系统迫切需要更强的防御措施。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier
compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel
black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our
approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary
search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces
under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models,
ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model
(LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates
consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per
instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models
to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

Motivation: 现有方法使用无边界、固定边界或简单评分函数边界，无法处理不同偏好的强度差异，且依赖可能嘈杂的评分信息。

Method: 扩展DPO方法，利用偏好之间的偏好监督来推断每个数据点的自适应边界，并提出两种采样策略来平衡判别性和生成性能。

Conclusion: 通过偏好之间的偏好标注可以学习自适应边界，改善RLHF性能，但需要平衡判别性和生成性能的权衡。

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

Result: 理论证明两种攻击策略仅需O(log T)次操纵即可成功，并在真实世界数据上的实证结果验证了攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了在线学习排序算法对对抗攻击的严重脆弱性，为开发更鲁棒的排序系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval
and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search
engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption,
the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for
attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to
promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K
recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear
regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies:
CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical
guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to
succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical
results on real-world data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 邻域采样是大规模图神经网络训练中的重要技术，能抑制邻域大小的指数增长并控制内存和时间成本。虽然已成为标准实现，但其系统性行为尚未被充分理解。

Method: 使用神经正切核工具进行理论分析，该工具基于无限宽神经网络对应的高斯过程来表征训练动态。研究了几种成熟的邻域采样方法及其对应的后验高斯过程。

Result: 在有限样本下，不同采样方法产生的后验分布各不相同，但随着样本量增加会收敛到相同的后验分布。后验协方差（预测误差均方值的下界）不可比较，这与没有采样方法占主导地位的观察结果一致。

Conclusion: 邻域采样方法在有限样本下存在差异，但没有一种方法在所有情况下都最优，这解释了实践中观察到的采样方法性能差异现象。

Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of
large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the
neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory
consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in
practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical
analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the
(analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide
counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established
neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With
limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to
the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance,
which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning
with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned
outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing
acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or
synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited
access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly
detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower
plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly
noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then,
we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which
are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage
plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world
conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC
0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered
strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational
cost.

Motivation: 标准的Conformal Prediction技术对数据集中的敏感属性不敏感，需要将公平性纳入CP框架，确保不同子组之间的条件覆盖保证

Method: 扩展Conformal Fairness框架到联邦学习设置，利用可交换性假设，在不同领域的数据集上进行实验验证

Result: 通过实证验证了该框架的有效性，能够审计联邦模型的公平性并分析不同人口群体间的公平性差距

Conclusion: 成功将公平性考虑整合到联邦学习环境中的Conformal Prediction框架，为联邦模型的公平性审计提供了有效方法

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying
uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers
probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic
to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to
incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across
different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work,
we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we
can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps
for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by
conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully
leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared
representations across domains, yet many traditional MA methods are incapable
of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability.
We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a
geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while
enabling generalization to unseen data. Our method enforces structured
cross-modal mappings to maintain geometric fidelity in learned embeddings. By
incorporating a pre-trained alignment model and a multitask learning
formulation, we improve cross-domain generalization and representation
robustness while maintaining alignment fidelity. We evaluate our approach using
several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information
preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework
to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate
multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a
single domain by leveraging insights from the multi-modal problem.

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限环境下的奖励感知蒸馏提供了理论基础扎实且实际高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by
formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent
work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into
distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward
weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes
task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model
to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state
augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a
modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint
satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access
during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian
methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we
demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and
better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while
maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a
theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware
distillation in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: MonoCon框架通过添加单调MLP头和对比损失，学习紧凑、鲁棒的解耦表示，在CIFAR-100上实现9倍压缩和1.5倍鲁棒性提升，保持99%分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI中学习高质量、鲁棒、高效和解耦表示的核心挑战，传统方法主要依赖架构和优化约束，本文引入功能约束作为第三种途径。

Method: 在预训练编码器上附加小型单调MLP头，通过对比损失和单调性约束引导编码器与头的协同适应，学习鲁棒解耦的紧凑嵌入。

Result: 在CIFAR-100图像分类任务中，表示比基线压缩近9倍，鲁棒性提升1.5倍，保持99%的5-NN分类精度；在SNLI句子相似任务中，表示压缩3.4倍，鲁棒性提升1.4倍。

Conclusion: 通过功能约束学习的鲁棒超紧凑表示为从边缘计算到云规模检索等不同场景的关键挑战提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

TL;DR: 本文研究了量化感知训练(QAT)中FP阶段和QAT阶段计算资源的最优分配比例，发现QAT与FP训练的最优比例随总计算量增加而增加，并提出了基于tokens-per-parameter-byte统计量的预测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然分解训练为FP阶段和QAT阶段能提高量化网络精度，但两个阶段计算资源的最优分配比例尚不明确，需要系统研究。

Method: 通过大量实验研究不同计算预算、QAT位宽和模型大小下QAT持续时间对性能的影响，提出损失缩放定律来预测最优QAT比例和最终性能。

Result: 发现QAT与FP训练的最优比例随总计算量增加而增加，且该比例可通过tokens-per-parameter-byte统计量准确预测。提出的冷却与QAT融合方法显著节省计算资源。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效QAT规划提供了实用指导，能够在相同计算预算下训练更高质量的量化模型。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the
accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing
training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields
superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of
compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive
experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from
86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final
performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the
loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of
compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide
range of model sizes and quantization widths using the
tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss
scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance
across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We
use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify
experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory
constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to
full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and
QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with
quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates
and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical
insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality
quantized models with the same compute budget.

Motivation: 分析Adam、Shampoo和SOAP优化算法，从梯度白化角度理解它们的预条件器如何近似白化矩阵，并建立SOAP与Shampoo的理论等价性。

Method: 从梯度白化角度解释优化算法的预条件器，建立SOAP与Shampoo的理论等价性，并通过nanoGPT语言建模和灰度图像着色实验进行验证。

Result: 实验结果显示SOAP与Shampoo具有相似的收敛速度，在最终损失上没有显著优于Adam和Shampoo，这与理论等价性一致。

Conclusion: SOAP、Shampoo和Adam在性能上表现相似，SOAP与Shampoo在理论上是等价的，这解释了它们相似的收敛行为。

Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently
emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training,
achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language
modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the
perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as
approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature
information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized
versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To
empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling
experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show
that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant
advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns
with their equivalence in theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SINQ是一种后训练量化方法，通过引入第二轴尺度因子和Sinkhorn-Knopp算法来归一化行和列方差，解决低比特量化中的精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前后训练量化方法在4比特及以下精度时会出现困惑度下降，主要原因是异常值表示导致共享相同尺度的参数出现精度问题，这在无校准均匀量化方法中尤为明显。

Method: SINQ通过添加第二轴尺度因子和快速Sinkhorn-Knopp算法，找到尺度来归一化每行和每列的方差，最小化矩阵不平衡这一新的量化代理目标。该方法层间无交互，可轻松应用于新架构的任何线性层。

Result: 在Qwen3模型家族和DeepSeek-V2.5上的评估显示，SINQ显著改善了WikiText2和C4的困惑度，优于无校准均匀量化基线，并可进一步与校准和非均匀量化级别结合增强效果。

Conclusion: SINQ是一种有效的后训练量化增强方法，能够解决低比特量化中的精度挑战，并具有良好的通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for
deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show
perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because
representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same
scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for
calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment
existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor
and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize
per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy
target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions
between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize
any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and
DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against
uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by
combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to
reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is
available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分数据同化方法在海洋和大气预报中广泛应用，但当涉及Hessian信息时计算成本高昂，需要一种更高效的方法来解决这一计算瓶颈。

Method: 采用元学习框架，利用傅里叶神经算子（FNO）学习一族数据同化问题中的逆Hessian算子，为共轭梯度法提供初始化，形成FNO-CG方法。

Result: 在线性平流方程上的数值实验表明，FNO-CG方法相比标准CG方法，平均相对误差减少62%，迭代次数减少17%，在病态条件下改进效果尤为显著。

Conclusion: FNO-CG方法为具有挑战性的数据同化问题提供了鲁棒且高效的解决方案，特别适用于病态场景，展示了元学习在科学计算中的潜力。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs), such as those in numerical weather prediction,
by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA
methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become
computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To
address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator
across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization
for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear
advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the
average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$
compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in
ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG
for challenging DA problems.

Conclusion: GDR-learners是一类灵活且理论性质优越的生成式因果推断方法，能够实现渐进最优的估计性能。

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential
outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the
favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated
with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we
introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust)
learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our
proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners
based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b)
conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional
variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models
(GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the
properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus
asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we
demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the
existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential
outcomes.

Conclusion: 该工作为结合不完美的人格评分和存在抽样偏差的人类评分以获得有效系统质量估计提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves
the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize
from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external
validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and
system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target
distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust
estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to
our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM
evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific
sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these
informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under
evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality
estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality
estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using
persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a
reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We
validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation
Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the
degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a
principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human
ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action
spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel
framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies
in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training
process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging
policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy
distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem,
training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This
decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training
performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample
efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks,
including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent
systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior
performance compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: 函数批评家建模为解决离策略AC学习中的核心挑战提供了新思路，既保证了理论收敛性，又在实际任务中表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an
effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within
this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical
success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the
off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad"
instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target"
problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor
learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact
off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem
to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the
second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and
often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is
typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy
gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of
functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses
both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We
provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the
provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical
perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network
architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its
effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the
DeepMind Control Benchmark.

Abstract: We introduce FAEclust, a novel functional autoencoder framework for cluster

realizations of vector-valued random functions. Our framework features a
universal-approximator encoder that captures complex nonlinear
interdependencies among component functions, and a universal-approximator
decoder capable of accurately reconstructing both Euclidean and manifold-valued
functional data. Stability and robustness are enhanced through innovative
regularization strategies applied to functional weights and biases.
Additionally, we incorporate a clustering loss into the network's training
objective, promoting the learning of latent representations that are conducive
to effective clustering. A key innovation is our shape-informed clustering
objective, ensuring that the clustering results are resistant to phase

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and
decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental
across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations
research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex
reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural
language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however,
achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without
leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate
optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear
programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans
training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common
mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference
strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver
feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs
demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and
feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average,
enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

Abstract: We study a class of multi-stage stochastic programs, which incorporate
modeling features from Markov decision processes (MDPs). This class includes
structured MDPs with continuous state and action spaces. We extend policy
graphs to include decision-dependent uncertainty for one-step transition
probabilities as well as a limited form of statistical learning. We focus on
the expressiveness of our modeling approach, illustrating ideas with a series
of examples of increasing complexity. As a solution method, we develop new
variants of stochastic dual dynamic programming, including approximations to
handle non-convexities.

*Yuanyuan Yang,Ruimin Zhang,Jamie Morgenstern,Haifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T-Tamer是一个多阶段决策框架，用于优化机器学习模型服务中的准确率-延迟权衡，证明了回溯机制对获得理论性能保证的必要性和充分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型规模和复杂度的增长，模型服务面临准确率、延迟、资源使用等多目标权衡问题。现有的启发式策略缺乏理论保证和通用性。

Method: 将多模型服务形式化为多阶段决策过程，提出基于回溯的策略，允许在后续阶段重新访问早期模型，并证明这种策略能在多项式时间内获得最优权衡。

Result: 在合成数据集以及视觉和NLP基准测试上的实验表明，基于回溯的策略能够持续产生高效的准确率-延迟权衡。

Conclusion: 回溯机制是获得可证明性能保证的关键，为早期退出和级联模型的设计提供了连接启发式实践与理论保证的原则性基础。

Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient
serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency,
resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates
these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision
balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the
pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain
largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees
and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a
multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to
exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the
ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for
achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that
strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to
the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the
optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and
early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that
recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency
trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging
heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and
cascaded models.

*Zachary Baker,Yuxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 变分稀疏自编码器(vSAE)将变分方法引入稀疏自编码器，用随机采样替代确定性ReLU门控，但实验表明其性能不如标准SAE，KL散度项导致过度正则化，产生大量死特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究变分方法是否能改善稀疏自编码器的特征组织和可解释性，假设概率采样能产生分散压力，使特征在潜在空间中更连贯地组织并避免重叠。

Method: 提出变分稀疏自编码器(vSAE)，用学习的高斯后验的随机采样替代确定性ReLU门控，并加入朝向标准正态先验的KL散度正则化。在Pythia-70M transformer残差流激活上评估Topk vSAE与标准TopK SAE。

Result: vSAE在核心评估指标上表现不如标准SAE，但在特征独立性和消融指标上表现优异。KL散度项产生过度正则化压力，显著减少活跃特征比例，导致性能下降。vSAE特征表现出更好的鲁棒性，但死特征数量远多于基线。

Conclusion: 将变分方法简单应用于稀疏自编码器并不能改善特征组织或可解释性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for
interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse,
human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether
incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature
organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse
Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic
sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence
regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this
probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to
organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We
evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer
residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench,
individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space
visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core
evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics.
The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that
substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed
performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness,
they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that
naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature
organization or interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多类预测器校准误差定义，在指数样本复杂度和多项式样本复杂度之间插值，实现了多项式样本下的校准，并在误差参数依赖上达到接近最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类预测器的校准面临指数级样本复杂度的挑战，现有方法要么需要指数样本，要么只能处理多项式样本但效果有限。

Method: 使用自适应数据分析技术，通过高适应性但仅对数级样本开销的新颖应用，设计插值校准算法。

Conclusion: 该工作在多类校准的样本复杂度与误差保证之间取得了重要平衡，为实际应用提供了可行的校准方案。

Abstract: Calibrating a multiclass predictor, that outputs a distribution over labels,
is particularly challenging due to the exponential number of possible
prediction values. In this work, we propose a new definition of calibration
error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one
with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample
complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any
given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint,
using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve
nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work.
A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis
with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

Conclusion: SPS-GAN成功实现了从多种测量类型中学习多个物理系统的动力学，并能推广到未见参数，同时自动发现构型空间结构，为物理系统的建模提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world
evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent
neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to
encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical.
However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a
single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of
a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space
GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and
generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not
require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can
discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary
measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve
physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds
a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To
discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional
time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to
encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate
the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry
discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on
par with supervised models designed for single systems.

TL;DR: MoE-PHDS是一种轻量级微调方法，可将单个MoE检查点转换为全局稀疏度控制界面，实现推理时动态调整稀疏度而无需更换模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统MoE模型需要为不同稀疏度训练和维护多个模型的问题，降低部署复杂性和成本，提高满足多样化延迟、效率和能耗需求的灵活性。

Method: 采用跨稀疏度混合训练和在高稀疏度下进行简短课程学习的轻量级SFT方法，无需架构更改，将全局稀疏度作为推理时的一等公民。

Result: 在多个模型上实验表明，PHDS匹配或超过专用oracle模型，跨稀疏度一致性提升达22%，实现了简化和灵活的MoE运行时部署。

Conclusion: MoE-PHDS使单个模型能够通过调节k值在推理时实现可预测的精度/延迟权衡，简化了MoE部署并提高了灵活性。

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed
sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity
level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently,
meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple
models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance
costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and
energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime
sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf
H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a
single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training
across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity,
requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency
tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time
without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level
heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary
models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds
well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\%
vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE
deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

Conclusion: 层理论为高阶消息传递提供了自然且原则性的形式化框架，能够实现更富有表达力的局部与全局描述符之间的接口。

Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph
learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational
structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations
thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$
(HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge
(combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias
that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological
features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For
$k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In
higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and
potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a
natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's
diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more
expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates
dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware
generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend
prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light --
and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel
theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied
by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the
applied.

TL;DR: 该论文采用谱分析方法研究大语言模型训练过程中的表示几何变化，发现自回归预训练中存在三个几何阶段：初始的表示坍缩、熵寻求阶段和压缩寻求阶段，这些阶段与模型性能提升相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准训练指标如损失无法解释大语言模型中复杂能力的涌现，因此需要从表示几何的角度来理解模型训练过程。

Method: 使用谱分析方法，通过有效秩(RankMe)和特征谱衰减(α-ReQ)测量OLMo(1B-7B)和Pythia(160M-12B)模型在预训练和后训练过程中的表示几何变化。

Result: 发现自回归预训练中存在三个一致的几何阶段：初始表示坍缩、熵寻求阶段(维度扩展)和压缩寻求阶段(各向异性压缩)，压缩阶段与下游任务性能显著提升相关。后训练进一步改变几何：SFT和DPO驱动熵寻求动态，RLVR诱导压缩寻求。

Conclusion: 模型训练中的几何变化源于交叉熵优化与表示瓶颈的相互作用，不同训练阶段和后训练方法对表示几何产生不同影响，从而影响模型性能和行为。

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

Motivation: 灾难性干扰（灾难性遗忘）是机器学习中的基本挑战，当模型适应新任务时会逐渐丧失对先前学习任务的性能。本文旨在从潜在表示学习的角度更好地理解和建模这个问题。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略：首先使用最大似然估计从部分任务感知（PTA）和全任务感知（ATA）配置中学习潜在表示，然后优化KL散度来识别和学习共享潜在变量。

Result: 理论和实证验证表明，识别和学习这些共享表示可以有效缓解机器学习系统中的灾难性干扰问题。

Conclusion: 通过识别共享潜在变量的方法，为缓解灾难性干扰提供了理论保证和实际性能改进。

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a
fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model
progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to
new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic
interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and
propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference
as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting
phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA)
and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in
identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through
identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning,
we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we
employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from
both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to
identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee
and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these
shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in
machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and
practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence
(AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data
utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the
sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter
sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to
adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel
federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy
(DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage
sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP
strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware
adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural
architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized
architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with
theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy
guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\%
over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10
and communication cost to 1/20.

TL;DR: GuardNet是一个分层过滤框架，通过构建结构化图结合图神经网络来检测和过滤越狱提示，在多个数据集上显著优于现有防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型容易受到越狱攻击，这些攻击会绕过对齐约束并诱导未经授权或有害行为，威胁模型的安全性、可靠性和可信度。

Method: 构建结合序列链接、句法依赖和注意力派生令牌关系的结构化图，然后应用两层图神经网络：提示级过滤器检测全局对抗提示，令牌级过滤器定位细粒度对抗跨度。

Result: 在LLM-Fuzzer数据集上提示级F1分数从66.4%提升至99.8%，在PLeak数据集上从67-79%提升至超过94%。令牌级F1从48-75%提升至74-91%，IoU增益高达+28%。

Conclusion: GuardNet尽管结构复杂但保持可接受的延迟，在跨域评估中泛化良好，是实际部署中对抗越狱威胁的实用且鲁棒的防御方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak
attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and
induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the
safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks
in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we
propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters
jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs
that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived
token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns
indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two
levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and
(ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans.
Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show
that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level
F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\%
on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to
74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity,
GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain
evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats
in real-world LLM deployments.

Motivation: 传统MCMC方法在临界点和复杂能量景观中收敛缓慢，并行回火虽然通过温度交换改善混合，但每个副本仍依赖缓慢的局部更新。

Method: 训练Transformer在平衡样本上生成完整自旋配置，作为Metropolis步骤中的全局提议，与传统的单自旋翻转互补。

Conclusion: 神经网络提议能够系统性地加速蒙特卡洛方法，通过捕捉全局结构实现更快采样和更强的组合优化性能。

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and
combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough
landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across
temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its
configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium
samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the
target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for
global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual
single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces
magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures,
including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces
equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses
(optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy
states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes.
Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems,
IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to
unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution.
Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize
across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move
beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer
demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by
neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and
stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

Motivation: 在医疗等隐私敏感领域，联邦学习面临统计异质性挑战。受医疗场景启发，思考服务器能否不仅构建模型，还能指导新患者到最适合其病情的医院。

Method: 引入基于经验似然的框架，同时解决两个目标：(1)在每个客户端上学习有效的本地模型，(2)为新查询找到最佳匹配的客户端。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更智能、资源效率更高的联邦系统开辟了新方向，将异质性作为特征而非缺陷加以利用。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare,
where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is
statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly
across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient
demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates
from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains
under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a
central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the
hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to
propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the
allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the
network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework
that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on
each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query.
Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark
datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of
client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new
direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated
systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型往往过度依赖预训练中的语言先验，而未能充分利用视觉证据。现有分析方法无法揭示视觉信息如何影响模型内部机制。

Method: 通过嵌入链分析层间表示动态，识别视觉整合点(VIP)，并开发总视觉整合(TVI)估计器来量化视觉查询对响应生成的影响。

Result: 在54个模型-数据集组合中，VIP现象普遍存在，TVI能可靠预测语言先验的强度。

Conclusion: 该方法为诊断和理解LVLMs中的语言先验提供了原则性工具包。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal
tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual
patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior
analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the
internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To
address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior
through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise
representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal
phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical
layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden
representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we
introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates
representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query
influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9
contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently
emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This
offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in
LVLMs.

*Matt L. Sampson,Peter Melchior*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态系统建模的新型学习率调度器，通过超参数搜索的训练运行学习训练过程的潜在表示，预测具有最佳长期验证性能的未来学习率计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习率调度器要么遵循简单的参数函数，要么仅对短期训练信号做出反应，缺乏对神经网络训练性能的全面时间视图支持。

Method: 将神经网络训练性能建模为动态系统，利用超参数搜索的训练运行学习训练过程的潜在表示，根据当前训练指标预测最佳长期验证性能的未来学习率计划。

Result: 在CNN、ResNet图像分类和Transformer模型的下一标记预测任务中达到最先进水平，训练出的模型位于损失景观的更平坦区域，提供更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法计算效率高、优化器无关，可轻松集成到机器学习实验跟踪平台上，为学习率调度提供了更智能和自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural
network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric
functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are
supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually
train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training
performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training
runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the
training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future
learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our
scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates
specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions.
It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as
well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models
are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better
generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is
computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top
of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be
made available after acceptance.

*Wanjin Feng,Yuan Yuan,Jingtao Ding,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于谱相干性的可预测性对齐诊断框架，包含SCP评分和LUR工具，揭示了时间序列预测中可预测性漂移现象和模型架构的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前AI模型评估中标准指标混淆模型性能与数据内在不可预测性的根本缺陷，推动从简单聚合分数向可预测性感知评估的范式转变。

Method: 引入谱相干可预测性(SCP)评分和线性利用率(LUR)诊断工具，SCP量化预测实例的固有难度，LUR测量模型利用线性可预测信息的效率。

Result: 首次系统证明了"可预测性漂移"现象，发现复杂模型在低可预测性数据上表现更优，而线性模型在更可预测任务中非常有效。

Conclusion: 需要转向更深入的可预测性感知评估范式，促进更公平的模型比较和更深入理解模型行为。

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting,
progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards.
However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation
metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic
unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel,
predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our
framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence
Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and
task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given
forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a
frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a
model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We
validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core
insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability
drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over
time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex
models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are
highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift,
moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful,
predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a
deeper understanding of model behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLAD-Net是一个用于可穿戴传感器持续学习的框架，通过结合自监督Transformer和监督CNN，解决了分布漂移和灾难性遗忘问题，在PAMAP2数据集上取得了91.36%的最终准确率和仅8.78%的遗忘率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中可穿戴传感器数据存在分布漂移问题（如不同用户数据差异），传统深度学习模型假设数据分布稳定，在持续学习场景下会出现灾难性遗忘，且人类研究中的标注数据稀缺且不一致。

Method: CLAD-Net整合自监督Transformer（作为长期记忆）和监督CNN，Transformer通过跨传感器注意力捕捉全局活动模式学习通用表示，CNN通过知识蒸馏在按用户微调时保留先前知识。

Result: 在PAMAP2数据集上，CLAD-Net达到91.36%最终准确率，仅8.78%遗忘率，优于基于记忆和正则化的基线方法；在仅有10-20%标注数据的半监督设置下仍表现强劲。

Conclusion: CLAD-Net通过结合自监督和监督学习，有效解决了可穿戴传感器持续学习中的分布漂移和灾难性遗忘问题，对标注数据稀缺具有鲁棒性，消融研究验证了各模块的贡献。

Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring
using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While
deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions
- an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor
data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to
distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence
of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are
learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of
labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net
(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling
wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing
performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,
acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The
transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across
body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.
Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge
during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent
final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and
regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight
Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled
data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to
label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

*Hyunwoo Lee,Hayoung Choi,Hyunju Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对奇Sigmoid激活函数类的初始化方法，通过选择适当的噪声尺度来避免前向激活的塌陷或饱和，从而在没有归一化层的情况下实现可靠训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活函数和权重初始化相互依赖，不合适的初始化方法会导致非线性激活函数出现饱和、方差塌陷和学习率敏感性增加等问题。

Method: 定义了奇Sigmoid函数类，并为该类中的任何激活函数f提出了一个初始化方法，通过闭式选择噪声尺度来确保前向激活在目标层之前保持良好分散。

Result: 该方法在没有归一化层的情况下训练可靠，表现出强大的数据效率，并使得标准初始化方法（Xavier、He、正交）通常无法可靠收敛的激活函数能够学习。

Conclusion: 提出的初始化方法解决了激活函数与权重初始化之间的相互依赖问题，为奇Sigmoid类激活函数提供了有效的训练解决方案。

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and
recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However,
activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an
appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation,
variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by
defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this
class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a
noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up
to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation.
Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers,
exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under
which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not
converge reliably.

### [531] [Unleashing Flow Policies with Distributional Critics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23087)
*Deshu Chen,Yuchen Liu,Zhijian Zhou,Chao Qu,Yuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Distributional Flow Critic (DFC)，一种新的评论家架构，通过学习完整的状态-动作回报分布来解决流式策略中评论家表达能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式策略在离线强化学习中表现出强大的表达能力，但通常受限于只能学习单一标量期望回报的评论家，这限制了其处理复杂多模态行为的能力。

Method: DFC使用流匹配技术，将回报分布建模为从简单基础分布到复杂目标回报分布的连续灵活变换，而不是回归到单一值。

Result: 在D4RL和OGBench基准测试中，该方法在需要多模态动作分布的任务上表现优异，在离线和离线到在线微调方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFC通过提供丰富的分布式贝尔曼目标，为表达性流式策略提供了更稳定和信息丰富的学习信号，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and
offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex,
multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full
potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics,
which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a
novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return
distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow
matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible
transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target
distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based
policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable
and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance,
especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in
both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 对网络基础模型(NFMs)潜在知识的系统性研究，通过几何分析、度量对齐和因果敏感性测试揭示模型存在显著各向异性、特征敏感性不一致等问题，解决这些问题可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注下游任务性能，而本研究旨在深入分析网络基础模型中编码的潜在知识，关注隐藏表示而非纯性能表现。

Method: 采用三部分评估：嵌入几何分析评估表示空间利用，度量对齐评估测量与领域专家特征的对应关系，因果敏感性测试评估对协议扰动的鲁棒性。使用五个不同网络数据集评估四个最先进的NFMs。

Result: 发现所有模型都表现出显著的各向异性、不一致的特征敏感性模式、无法分离高层上下文、负载依赖等特性。解决这些限制可将模型性能显著提升高达+0.35 F1分数。

Conclusion: 研究识别了所有模型中的众多限制，并证明解决这些限制可以显著改进模型性能，而无需架构更改。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge
encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden
representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance.
Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part
evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space
utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with
domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness
to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning
controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs,
revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature
sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload
dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations
across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly
improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural
changes).

TL;DR: 本文提出了计算扩散模型对训练数据扰动的敏感性的方法，无需重新训练即可预测模型样本的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练扩散模型近似于从数据分布到最优评分函数的映射，但无法直接微分该映射。如果能计算其导数，就能在重新训练前预测模型对训练集微小扰动的响应。

Method: 提出了闭式程序计算该映射的方向导数，仅需黑盒访问预训练评分模型及其对输入的导数。扩展该方法估计扩散模型样本对目标度量加性扰动的敏感性。

Result: 方法对数值和近似误差具有鲁棒性，计算时间与从扩散模型采样和计算样本路径的对数似然相当。敏感性结果与重新训练和微调后图像扩散模型样本的实际变化相关。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效预测扩散模型对训练数据扰动的敏感性，为模型优化和调整提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$
to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate
this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the
model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set
before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for
computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access
to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We
extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples
to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to
sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample
path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the
resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's
samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CE-PO是一个增强策略优化的奖励塑造框架，通过Jacobian敏感性估计模型内部影响，抑制干扰信号，并将因果连贯性分数与任务准确性反馈融合，减少奖励黑客行为和不忠实的思维链推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过强化目标训练时，往往采用捷径策略获得表面正确的答案，将正确输出与虚假或不忠实的推理配对，并在小的因果扰动下性能下降。

Method: 引入因果增强策略优化(CE-PO)，使用Jacobian敏感性估计模型内部影响，通过反事实硬化抑制干扰信号，并通过Minkowski组合器将连贯性分数与任务准确性反馈融合。

Result: 在4个数据集上的实验结果显示，CE-PO相比基线平均提高准确性5.49%（最高9.58%），同时提高了对相关-因果翻转和轻微反事实编辑的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CE-PO减少了奖励黑客行为和不忠实的思维链推理，同时提高了对相关-因果翻转和轻微反事实编辑的鲁棒性，且准确性几乎相当。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

Motivation: 区块链的匿名性为非法活动创造了机会，传统反洗钱方法面临挑战。需要能够同时捕捉结构和时间依赖关系、且对噪声和对抗行为具有鲁棒性的模型。

Method: 使用集成学习框架整合图卷积网络(GCN)、图注意力网络(GAT)和图同构网络(GIN)，采用软投票机制，并设计了量子兼容的模块化架构。

Result: 在真实世界Elliptic数据集上，优化的软投票集成实现了高非法交易召回率，同时误报率低于1%，超越了单个GNN模型和基线方法。

Conclusion: 集成GNN为实时加密货币监控提供了实用且前瞻性的解决方案，既具有即时反洗钱效用，又为量子增强的金融安全分析铺平了道路。

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure,
decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates
opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in
anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in
blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and
temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and
adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that
integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection.
Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves
high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate
below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular
architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future
integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph
neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term
adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight
ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time
cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway
toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了8位Muon优化器，使用分块量化技术，在保持Muon优化器性能的同时显著减少内存占用，在LLM预训练中表现优于AdamW和8位AdamW。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在LLM预训练中表现出比AdamW更快的收敛速度和2倍计算效率，但像AdamW一样需要存储模型权重和累积梯度，存在内存开销问题。现有的8位AdamW变体虽然通过分块量化缓解了这个问题，但通常只在动态量化下稳定。

Method: 开发了8位Muon优化器，采用分块量化技术，支持线性和动态两种量化方案。通过理论分析解释了其在量化下的鲁棒性。

Result: 8位Muon相比全精度Muon减少了约74%的内存占用，在1.6B模型预训练实验中性能与Muon相当，同时优于AdamW和8位AdamW。在Llama 3.2 3B模型微调中也表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 8位Muon优化器在保持Muon优化器优势的同时，显著降低了内存需求，为大规模模型训练提供了高效的内存优化解决方案。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown
faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM
pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model
weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this
overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under
dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for
extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using
blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We
demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering
$\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In
extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while
outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb
tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B
model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help
explain this robustness under quantization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动预测面临复杂长距离依赖和多尺度周期性行为的挑战，需要有效处理时序数据的方法。

Method: 使用时间标记化将轨迹分割为日段，编码为离散标记，采用层次注意力捕获日和周的依赖关系，结合预计算提示嵌入增强表示，并冻结预训练LLM主干以减少计算复杂度。

Conclusion: RHYTHM框架有效利用LLM作为通用时空预测器，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了人类移动预测性能。

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

TL;DR: Impute-MACFM是一个用于表格数据插补的掩码感知条件流匹配框架，专门处理随机缺失、随机缺失和非随机缺失机制，通过稳定性和一致性约束实现高效高质量的插补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据（特别是医疗纵向数据）中缺失值普遍存在，会削弱模型保真度和可靠性。现有插补方法要么限制性假设过多，要么难以处理复杂的跨特征结构，而生成方法存在不稳定和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 采用掩码感知条件流匹配框架，仅对缺失条目构建轨迹，同时约束观测条目的预测速度接近零；结合稳定性惩罚、一致性正则化和时间衰减噪声注入；推理时使用约束保持的ODE积分和逐步投影。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Impute-MACFM实现了最先进的性能，相比竞争方法提供了更鲁棒、高效和高质量的插补结果。

Conclusion: 流匹配为表格缺失数据问题（包括纵向数据）提供了一个有前景的方向，Impute-MACFM在该领域表现出色。

Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data
in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and
reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or
struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative
approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose
Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular
imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random,
missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds
trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to
remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules.
Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii)
consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed
noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving
ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix
observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness.
Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while
delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing
approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular
missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如GRPO及其变体）在开发推理模型时存在严重的过度自信问题，阻碍了实现自我感知推理模型的目标。

Method: 提出组序列策略梯度（GSPG）框架消除token级偏差，使用归一化序列级概率定义模型置信度，并应用交叉熵正则化器将模型置信度校准到序列奖励。对于二元奖励，置信度校准正则化器和GSPG具有协作性；对于非二元奖励，应用非线性奖励归一化和自适应正则化器裁剪。

Result: 在逻辑和数学推理任务中对大型语言模型进行后训练，C²GSPG在推理准确性和置信度校准方面均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: C²GSPG是一个简单而有效的方法，能同时提升推理性能并抑制过度自信，为开发更可靠的推理模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at
https://github.com/HaotianLiu123/CCGSPG.

Result: PIRO在MuJoCo、Gym-Robotics基准测试和真实动物行为建模任务中，在奖励恢复和策略模仿方面达到或超越最先进方法，具有高样本效率

Conclusion: TRRO为逆强化学习提供了类似TRPO的稳定性保证，PIRO是实用且稳定的IRL算法

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain
expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax)
formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often
lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve
stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations
but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a
unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly
maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing
the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust
Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic
improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We
instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical
and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to
the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward
RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward
recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and
Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

*Sipeng Chen,Yan Zhang,Shibo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OptiINR是一个统一框架，将隐式神经表示(INR)配置作为优化问题，使用贝叶斯优化自动选择最佳激活函数和初始化参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前INR配置缺乏系统性策略，依赖临时启发式方法或网格搜索，导致跨模态结果不一致，需要统一优化框架。

Method: 采用贝叶斯优化在离散激活函数族（如SIREN、WIRE、FINER）和连续初始化参数的联合空间中进行高效搜索。

Result: OptiINR能够找到全局最优配置，在各种信号处理应用中一致地最大化性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为INR设计建立了原则性基础，用数据驱动的优化过程取代了分散的手动调优。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from
image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is
fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal
configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales,
layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices
dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies
on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often
leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces
OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a
rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR
efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as
sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and
their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach
replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization
process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a
principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance
across diverse signal processing applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE)机制，通过将键值对重新构想为局部专家，为每个查询自适应选择相关时间戳，解决时间序列建模中的滞后效应和异常段问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在时间序列建模中的两个关键挑战：(1) 固有的滞后效应，历史时间戳对查询的相关性动态变化；(2) 异常段引入噪声信号降低预测准确性。

Method: 提出TMOE机制，将键值对视为局部专家，通过局部过滤无关时间戳进行自适应专家选择，同时保留全局专家捕捉长期依赖关系。将TMOE集成到PatchTST和Timer框架中，创建TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G。

Result: 在七个真实世界长期预测基准测试中，TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TMOE机制有效解决了时间序列建模中的滞后效应和异常段问题，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling
global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all'
context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world
data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to
a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy
signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we
propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism
that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a
distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each
query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this
local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength
in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention
mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and
Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific
version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on
seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert
and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Mirror-Critique框架，通过对比模型生成解与真实解来训练具有信息性批评能力的验证器，显著提升大语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于奖励模型选择的测试时扩展方法往往无法识别少数但正确的答案，限制了其有效性。这源于验证器训练中缺乏信息性批评信号。

Method: 使用小型指令调优模型通过拒绝采样合成高质量批评数据，对比模型生成解与真实解，为验证器提供丰富的批评信号。通过RLVR过程进一步改进验证能力。

Result: Mirror-Verifier在解决方案准确性方面显著优于多数投票，同时提高了求解器识别自身能力边界并拒绝回答的诚实性。

Conclusion: Mirror-Critique框架通过提供信息性批评信号有效提升了验证器的性能，在推理任务中实现了更好的解决方案选择和诚实性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key
paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it
often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its
effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this
limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier
training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that
trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage
the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with
ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize
high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier
not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start
the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The
resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by
generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify
score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental
results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting
in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to
recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

TL;DR: CrystalGym是一个用于晶体材料发现的开源强化学习环境，通过直接使用DFT计算作为反馈信号来优化材料设计过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习方法在材料设计中主要使用生成方法，但缺乏直接DFT信号作为训练反馈。为了将直接DFT信号纳入材料设计循环，需要开发专门的强化学习环境。

Method: 提出CrystalGym环境，使用DFT直接计算能带隙、体积模量和密度等属性作为奖励信号。评估了常见的基于价值和策略的强化学习算法，并研究了在大语言模型上进行微调以改进基于DFT奖励的方法。

Result: 实验表明不同算法在不同环境和设置下具有不同的样本效率和收敛特性。虽然没有任何算法能完全解决所有CrystalGym任务，但为处理耗时奖励信号的强化学习方法提供了新的挑战类别。

Conclusion: CrystalGym旨在作为强化学习研究者和材料科学家的测试平台，推动面向实际应用的跨学科机器学习研究，为处理真实世界设计问题铺平道路。

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床评估频率低且敏感性不足，难以捕捉老年人细微的认知衰退，需要更自然、连续的监测方法。

Method: 基于LSTM模型分析多模态感知数据的行为序列，采用日常感知增强生成合成序列，以及人口统计个性化重新加权训练样本。

Result: 在36名老年人6个月数据上，AUPRC从0.637提升到0.766，显著改善了认知障碍检测性能。

Conclusion: 被动感知技术结合增强方法可有效扩展老年人认知障碍的监测规模。

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and
intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity
and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults.
Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic
and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented
a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from
sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data
collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions
are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1)
routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing
each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic
personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from
individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on
6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area
Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and
demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of
scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive
sensing.

TL;DR: ProtoTS是一个可解释的时间序列预测框架，通过建模原型时间模式实现高精度和透明决策，提供多级可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释模型只能提供局部和部分解释，无法揭示异质输入变量如何共同塑造预测曲线中的整体时间模式。

Method: 基于去噪表示计算实例-原型相似度，通过分层组织的原型捕获全局时间模式和细粒度局部变化。

Result: 在多个现实基准测试中，ProtoTS在预测精度上超过现有方法，并提供专家可指导的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoTS实现了高精度预测和透明决策，支持模型理解和决策支持。

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series
forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making
process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable
models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the
capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly
shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS,
a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy
and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal
patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised
representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The
prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns
with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with
detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability.
Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF
dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast
accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model
understanding and decision support.

TL;DR: 将密集关联记忆从向量扩展到概率分布，提出了基于2-Wasserstein距离的分布关联记忆框架，主要关注高斯密度的Bures-Wasserstein类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集关联记忆模型仅限于向量表示，需要扩展到概率分布以支持更丰富的表示形式，并连接经典关联记忆与现代生成建模。

Method: 定义了对存储分布的对数求和指数能量函数，以及通过Gibbs加权方式聚合最优传输映射的检索动态。稳态点对应于自一致的Wasserstein重心。

Result: 证明了指数存储容量，提供了在Wasserstein扰动下的定量检索保证，并在合成和真实世界分布任务上验证了模型性能。

Conclusion: 该工作将关联记忆从向量提升到完整分布，为记忆增强学习中的分布存储和检索提供了新框架。

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via
energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector
representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the
2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of
Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored
distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a
Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent
Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove
exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under
Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world
distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to
full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and
enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了参数高效微调(PEFT)在科学机器学习中的应用，发现适配器调优在大型算子模型上显著优于LoRA，并提出基于频谱复杂度的频率自适应适配器(F-Adapter)，在3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调在视觉和语言处理中已被证明有效，但在科学机器学习领域尚未探索，该领域的目标是建模复杂物理系统。

Method: 引入频率自适应适配器(F-Adapter)，根据频谱复杂度分配适配器容量，对低频分量使用高维模块，对高频分量使用低维模块。

Result: F-Adapter在多个具有挑战性的3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中建立了最先进的结果，显著提高了泛化能力和频谱保真度。

Conclusion: 这是首个探索科学机器学习中PEFT的工作，确立了F-Adapter作为该领域的有效范式。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for
complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language
processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine
learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct
the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs)
obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that
the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance
on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that
stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within
Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and,
by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain
exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain.
Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical
characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce
Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity
based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to
low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency
components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on
multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both
generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques
commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an
effective paradigm for this domain.

TL;DR: ZeroSiam是一种用于测试时熵最小化的非对称孪生架构，通过非对称散度对齐防止模型崩溃，在保持高效的同时提升模型泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯熵最小化方法容易导致模型崩溃，如通过增大logit范数或将所有预测推向主导类别来减少熵，这会形成无意义的学习结果。

Method: 采用非对称孪生架构，通过可学习预测器和分类器前的停止梯度操作实现非对称散度对齐，防止模型崩溃。

Result: ZeroSiam不仅防止崩溃，还能吸收和正则化有偏学习信号，在各种测试场景和不同规模模型上表现稳定且高效。

Conclusion: ZeroSiam为测试时熵最小化提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，在视觉适应和大语言模型推理任务中均表现出色。

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and
incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during
inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own
predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy
minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit
norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking
collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize
the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce
ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time
entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence
alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a
stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but
also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance
even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show
that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible
overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language
model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models,
including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

Result: 实验结果表明CoSIFL在提高模型鲁棒性和降低服务器总成本方面优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: CoSIFL通过集成安全、隐私和激励机制，有效解决了联邦学习中的关键挑战，证明了集成设计的有效性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces
challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in
incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy
requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel
framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local
differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a
Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data
sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust
aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock
contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data
contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between
the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server
determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration
settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size,
privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client
game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional
attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect
system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and
reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated
design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件加速的4位浮点格式(MXFP4和NVFP4)承诺革新大语言模型推理，但其实际效益尚未得到验证，需要评估这些格式在真实场景中的表现。

Method: 提出Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ)算法，通过块状Hadamard变换和格式特定优化来适应FP4的独特特性，并开发高性能GPU内核实现旋转融合和快速激活计算。

Result: MR-GPTQ在NVIDIA B200上实现层间3.6倍和端到端2.2倍加速，在RTX5090上实现层间6倍和端到端4倍加速，显著提升MXFP4精度使其接近NVFP4水平。

Conclusion: 虽然FP4不是INT4的自动升级，但格式专门化方法如MR-GPTQ能够解锁精度与性能权衡的新前沿。

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats
such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to
revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical
benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and
NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and
real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods
struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably
neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two
scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the
classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to
FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and
format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of
high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible
overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of
the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and
2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on
RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches
or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the
point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an
automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock
a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了上下文价值感知的上下文强化学习(CV-ICRL)，通过引入上下文价值来解决上下文模糊性问题，有效防止了ICRL模型在测试时性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ICRL方法在训练时使用单调策略改进数据，但在测试时无法持续改进性能。研究发现这是由于上下文模糊性导致的恶性循环，模型自身的随机动作会生成与训练数据中次优策略相似的交互历史。

Method: 提出CV-ICRL框架，在训练阶段引入上下文价值作为显式信号，表示给定当前上下文时策略理论上可达到的理想性能。提出了两种在训练和测试时估计上下文价值的方法。

Result: 在Dark Room和Minigrid测试平台上的实验表明，CV-ICRL有效缓解了性能下降问题，并在各种任务和环境中提升了ICRL的整体能力。

Conclusion: 上下文价值通过收紧相对于理想单调改进策略的性能差距下界，成功解决了上下文模糊性问题，为ICRL的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past
experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches
train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online
RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our
experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a
continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,
we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own
stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly
resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a
vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we
introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed
ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing
the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current
context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant
information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We
prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap
relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two
methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.
Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that
CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL
abilities across various tasks and environments. The source code and data of
this paper are available at

*Xin Li,Mengbing Liu,Yiyang Zhu,Wenhe Zhang,Li Wei,Jiancheng An,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WirelessMathLM是一个专门针对无线通信数学问题的紧凑模型，通过领域特定的强化学习实现高性能，在无线数学基准测试中接近GPT-4o表现，同时参数量减少100倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用数学推理上表现出色，但在专业无线通信数学问题上表现不佳，需要精确处理信息论界限、优化约束和信号处理公式。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)和二进制验证奖励进行领域特定的强化学习，无需监督预热，直接从基础检查点训练模型。

Result: 7B模型在WirelessMathBench-XL上达到39.5%准确率，接近GPT-4o(40.4%)，参数量比DeepSeek-R1(671B)少约100倍。GRPO训练使所有模型规模性能几乎翻倍，并在通用数学基准上有正向迁移。

Conclusion: 紧凑模型通过领域特定的强化学习可以在专业数学任务上达到或超过大型模型性能，验证性正确性的独特属性使强化学习无需人工反馈即可有效工作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail
catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless
communications, where problems require precise manipulation of
information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing
formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent
performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models
(0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through
domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight
is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable
correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human
feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027
problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints
without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on
WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times
fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training
nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B
+81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models
gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and
AIME without any training on these tasks.

*Bingshuai Liu,Ante Wang,Zijun Min,Liang Yao,Haibo Zhang,Yang Liu,Anxiang Zeng,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEC-RL是一个将推测解码与强化学习rollout过程集成的新框架，通过重用先前轨迹段作为推测前缀来减少冗余计算，将rollout时间减少2-3倍而不影响策略质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加速方法（如并行化、目标驱动修改和重放缓冲区）存在收益递减、引入偏差或忽视迭代间冗余的问题。连续训练epoch的rollout经常包含大量重叠段，浪费计算资源。

Method: SPEC-RL重用先前轨迹段作为推测前缀，通过草稿-验证机制扩展它们，避免冗余生成同时确保策略一致性。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500、OlympiadBench、MMLU-STEM等数学推理和泛化基准测试中，SPEC-RL将rollout时间减少2-3倍，且不损害策略质量。

Conclusion: SPEC-RL作为纯rollout阶段增强，可与主流算法（如PPO、GRPO、DAPO）无缝集成，为大规模推理模型的RLVR扩展提供了通用实用的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

*Shayan Alahyari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LatentDiff框架，使用条件扩散模型在潜在表示空间中合成高质量特征，以解决深度不平衡回归问题，在保持整体准确性的同时显著提升少数区域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实回归任务中数据分布严重偏斜，模型主要从丰富的多数样本学习，难以准确预测少数标签。虽然不平衡分类已被广泛研究，但不平衡回归相对较少探索，特别是针对高维非结构化数据的深度不平衡回归缺乏专门的数据级解决方案。

Method: 提出LatentDiff框架，使用条件扩散模型结合基于优先级的生成策略，在潜在表示空间中合成高质量特征。该方法计算高效，适用于图像、文本等多种高维数据模态。

Result: 在三个深度不平衡回归基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在少数区域取得显著改进，同时保持了整体准确性。

Conclusion: LatentDiff填补了深度不平衡回归领域数据级解决方案的空白，为处理高维不平衡回归问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: In many real-world regression tasks, the data distribution is heavily skewed,
and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to
predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been
extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep
imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are
high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for
tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks
dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies
primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose
LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with
priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent
representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable
across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other
high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall
accuracy.

*Manjiang Yu,Priyanka Singh,Xue Li,Yang Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ATDP方法，通过针对敏感token梯度施加更大噪声，显著减少DP训练时间，在保护敏感信息的同时保持模型在非敏感数据上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DP-SGD方法对所有梯度施加均匀噪声，导致训练时间显著延长且模型精度下降。需要一种能针对性保护敏感信息而不影响整体性能的方法。

Method: ATDP方法对敏感和非敏感token的梯度分配不同权重，在训练早期使用更大噪声尺度快速破坏敏感内容记忆，仅需少量额外epoch的轻量后处理。

Result: ATDP将DP微调训练时间减少约90%，达到与最先进DP-SGD方法相当的隐私保护水平，同时精度损失最小。

Conclusion: ATDP提供了一种高效、针对性的隐私保护方案，可无缝集成到现有DP微调流程中，显著降低计算开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal
information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of
differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise
into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing
model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients
associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time,
strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve
the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight
through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of
vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive
and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage
of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a
result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight
post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise
primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally
affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated
into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to
non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined
with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP
pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD
methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning,
shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving
comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于神经网络的高维参数空间子空间回归方法，通过预测比所需维度更大的子空间来降低学习复杂度并提高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数化降阶模型在参数空间高维时，经典插值策略变得不可行或不可靠，需要更有效的子空间近似方法。

Method: 将插值问题放松为回归问题，引入适合子空间数据的损失函数，使用神经网络近似高维目标函数，并通过预测更大维度的子空间来简化学习问题。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法降低了椭圆特征问题的映射复杂度，并使Grassmann流形上的光滑映射更平滑。实验结果显示预测更大子空间能显著提高精度。

Conclusion: 子空间回归方法在参数特征问题、紧缩技术、松弛方法、最优控制和参数偏微分方程求解等任务中具有实用价值。

Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear
subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach
becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on
parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute
subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding
offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown
parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is
high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible
or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,
introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural
network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further
simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting
subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically
that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic
eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for
general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show
that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are
predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace
regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric
eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and
solution of parametric partial differential equations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法需要大量数据且计算成本高，而小规模但精确针对性的训练数据可能更有效地提升模型推理能力。

Method: 采用对抗性框架，模型轮流扮演攻击者和防御者，由工具增强的评判者监督，生成带解释性注释的多步骤问题，针对特定推理能力进行数据合成。

Result: 在4B参数模型上，NanoFlux生成的数据相比完整基准微调：数学推理提升5.9%，科学推理提升3.6%，医学推理提升16.6%，同时计算需求降低3-14倍。

Conclusion: 研究表明模型性能与数据集特征存在非单调关系，未来模型改进可能在于智能合成小规模、精确针对性的训练数据集。

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted
training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets
containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning
approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models
alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge,
synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target
specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on
NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains
compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning
(GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical
reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x.
Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset
characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal
points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates
training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering,
tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future
model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely
targeted training datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测抗体-抗原界面对于疫苗设计、免疫诊断和治疗性抗体开发至关重要，但仅从序列进行可靠预测仍具挑战性。

Method: 基于Conformer骨干网络，引入物理启发的滑动注意力机制，无需三维结构数据即可恢复残基级接触。

Result: 在SARS-CoV-2抗体-抗原数据集上达到最先进性能，超越了广泛使用的基于序列的方法；消融研究显示滑动注意力显著提高了表位预测精度。

Conclusion: ABCONFORMER能够仅从序列准确预测抗体-抗原界面，为疫苗设计和抗体开发提供了有效的计算工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for
vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development.
However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the
Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a
biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the
physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery
without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can
accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen
sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information.
In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on
a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based
methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further
quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to
conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the
precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release
the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖启发式指导或与SMC结合进行偏差校正，需要更灵活、高效的替代方案

Method: 使用副本交换算法，顺序生成粒子，保持样本多样性，支持在线优化和提前终止

Result: 在温度退火、奖励倾斜、模型组合和分类器自由指导去偏等任务中表现优异，与SMC方法性能相当

Conclusion: CREPE为扩散模型推理时控制提供了灵活有效的解决方案，具有高多样性和在线优化能力

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to
satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly
relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative
based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling
problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica
Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2)
maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and
(3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its
versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing,
reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with
competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种机器学习方法（从头机器学习、迁移学习和集成整合）在乳腺癌生存预后中的表现，发现这些方法在PREDICT v3工具因信息缺失无法预测的情况下仍能提供准确预后，且能改善校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基因组预后工具成本高且可及性差，而临床病理预后更经济易得。机器学习方法为构建稳健的预后框架提供了机会，特别是在PREDICT v3工具因信息缺失无法预测的情况下。

Method: 使用MA.27试验数据训练模型，在TEAM试验和SEER队列中进行外部验证。方法包括：迁移学习（微调预训练工具PREDICT v3）、从头机器学习（随机生存森林和极端梯度提升）、集成整合（模型预测的加权求和）。

Result: 迁移学习、从头RSF和集成整合在MA.27中改善了校准性能（ICI从0.042降至≤0.007），区分度保持相当（AUC从0.738升至0.744-0.799）。ML模型和集成整合在信息缺失时仍能预测生存。年龄、淋巴结状态、病理分级和肿瘤大小是最重要的预后因素。

Conclusion: 当PREDICT v3所需相关信息缺失或可能存在数据集偏移时，迁移学习、从头RSF和集成整合可以改善乳腺癌预后预测。

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer
management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic
prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less
costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and
ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication
frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in
breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained
prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used
for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER
cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic
tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme
Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum
of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration
improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from
0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC
increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3
predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing
information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict
survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age,
nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values,
indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation
in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and
ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo
RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where
relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is
likely.

Motivation: 传统资产-负债管理方法难以有效平衡探索与利用，且需要复杂调参。本文旨在开发一种无需学习环境模型、能直接学习最优策略的强化学习方法。

Method: 采用模型无关的策略梯度软演员-评论家算法，为演员引入自适应探索机制，为评论家引入调度探索机制，以最小化调参需求。

Result: 在200个随机市场场景中测试，该方法比两种增强的传统金融策略、一种基于模型的连续时间RL方法和三种最先进RL算法获得更高的平均奖励，具有快速初始收益和持续优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法的优越性并非来自复杂神经网络或改进的参数估计，而是通过直接学习最优ALM策略而不学习环境实现的。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by
employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic
(LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We
develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm
tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure
an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning,
we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for
the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced
traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and
three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market
scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative
strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The
outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter
estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without
learning the environment.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic
management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper
introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight
Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining
analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a
more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art
models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4
performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in
the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements
across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations,
including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR
data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary
differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft
performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a
full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

Motivation: 不规则多元时间序列在医疗和金融等关键领域普遍存在，但异步采样和不规则间隔给现有方法带来两个核心挑战：如何准确表示原始信息而不引入数据失真，以及如何有效捕捉观测点之间的复杂动态依赖关系。

Method: ASTGI框架包含四个模块：时空点表示模块将离散观测编码为可学习嵌入空间中的点；邻域自适应图构建模块通过最近邻搜索为每个点构建因果图；时空动态传播模块基于点间相对时空位置生成消息并计算交互权重，迭代更新自适应因果图上的信息；基于查询点的预测模块通过聚合邻域信息进行回归预测。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，ASTGI优于各种最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ASTGI框架有效解决了不规则多元时间序列预测中的关键挑战，通过自适应时空图交互实现了更准确的预测性能。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains
like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive
decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals
inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to
accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without
introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex
dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges,
we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework.
Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point
Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a
learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive
Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in
the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a
Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on
these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction
weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points.
Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by
aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing
regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent
computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates
and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a
looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across
consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across
checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and
increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling
of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These
dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order
difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance,
stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy
of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

high-dimensional settings, where existing methods often lose spatial structure
or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued
regression, where each sample is naturally represented as a matrix. We propose
MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based
Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost
Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to
preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global
features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical
and deep learning methods. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
domains demonstrate that MELCOT consistently outperforms all baselines while
remaining highly efficient.

Motivation: 现有机制可解释性工具如稀疏自编码器缺乏时间依赖建模、瞬时关系表示和理论保证，而因果表示学习方法虽理论基础扎实但无法扩展到LLM的丰富概念空间。

Method: 引入可识别的时间因果表示学习框架，专门针对LLM高维概念空间设计，能够捕捉时间延迟和瞬时因果关系，并扩展稀疏自编码器技术。

Result: 在匹配真实世界复杂度的合成数据集上验证了方法的有效性，成功在LLM激活中发现有意义的concept关系。

Conclusion: 同时建模时间和瞬时概念关系能够显著推进LLM的可解释性研究。

Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their
internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability
tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract
interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling,
instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical
guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical
confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation
learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent
concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to
inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable
temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for
LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and
instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees
and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world
complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we
successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our
findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual
relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

Motivation: 尽管开源仓库中存在大量非鲁棒预训练模型，但它们在鲁棒微调方面的潜力尚未被充分理解。本文旨在系统性地研究从非鲁棒模型进行RFT的挑战和解决方案。

Method: 提出Epsilon-Scheduling方法，通过在训练过程中调度扰动强度来促进最优迁移；引入预期鲁棒性指标，在测试时全面评估不同模型在精度-鲁棒性权衡方面的表现。

Result: 实验表明，使用鲁棒目标微调非鲁棒模型会导致次优迁移，在挑战性场景下甚至可能完全失败。Epsilon-Scheduling方法成功防止了次优迁移，并持续提高了预期鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Epsilon-Scheduling是一种有效的启发式方法，能够解决从非鲁棒预训练模型进行鲁棒微调时的次优迁移问题，为RFT提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the
Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine
learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While
recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing
interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable
way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem.
We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces.
Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically
known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building
this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and
additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM
algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both
existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work
provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete
spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies.

Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated
near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian
optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through
the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by
classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class
of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our
key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to
the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function
enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and
Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection
between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data
distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied
parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score
networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building
on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms --
Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD)
-- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate
manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference
tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical
generative and design applications.

TL;DR: 该论文从理论上分析了连续思维链在训练过程中的动态机制，揭示了叠加机制如何通过梯度训练自然产生，包括思维生成和预测两个阶段，以及索引匹配logit的平衡作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究表明连续思维链通过隐式并行思维提升大语言模型的推理能力，并有理论证明两层transformer能通过叠加机制高效解决有向图可达性问题，但尚不清楚这种叠加机制如何从梯度训练中自然学习得到。

Method: 理论分析简化两层transformer在有向图可达性问题上的训练动态，揭示训练过程中思维生成阶段和预测阶段的工作机制，以及索引匹配logit的变化规律。

Result: 分析发现训练过程中索引匹配logit会先增加后保持有界，这种有界性有效平衡了推理过程中的探索与利用，使模型在不确定时对多个搜索轨迹赋予可比权重，从而产生叠加机制。实验进一步验证了理论。

Conclusion: 连续思维链训练过程中自然产生的叠加机制源于索引匹配logit的有界性，这种机制平衡了局部搜索和全局探索，使模型能够同时维护多个推理轨迹。

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT)
improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling
implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight
by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can
efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of
multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains
unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from
gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the
training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph
reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during
training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that
autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage
that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that
during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an
important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search
ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions.
The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and
exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem
structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights
to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is
correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the
growth of logits further validate our theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出并评估了基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KANs)的特征选择方法，包括KAN-L1、KAN-L2、KAN-SI和KAN-KO四种选择器，在多个表格数据集基准测试中与传统基线方法进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据集需要有效的特征选择来提高预测性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。KANs通过样条参数化特征变换，能够直接获取可解释的重要性度量。

Method: 引入四种KAN-based选择器(KAN-L1、KAN-L2、KAN-SI、KAN-KO)，在分类和回归表格数据集基准上与经典基线方法(LASSO、随机森林、互信息、SVM-RFE)进行比较。

Result: KAN-based选择器在结构和合成数据集中与传统基线方法竞争且有时更优。KAN-L1在回归中过于激进，KAN-L2在分类中表现不佳。KAN-L2和KAN-SI在噪声回归和异构数据集上提供稳健性能。

Conclusion: 基于KAN的特征选择为传统方法提供了强大且可解释的替代方案，能够发现超越稀疏性或基于不纯度度量的非线性和多变量特征相关性。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve
predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and
evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations
through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures.
We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical
baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple
classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three
retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results
reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive
with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic
datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression,
removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in
classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature
interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust
performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning
closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such
as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes
surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in
high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that
KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative
to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate
feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

TL;DR: 提出图一致性正则化(GCR)框架，通过将模型预测衍生的关系图结构注入学习过程，促进类感知的语义特征表示，作为自提示机制让模型利用自身输出来优化内部结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络学习的丰富表示常包含与模型预测语义相矛盾的嘈杂类间相似性，需要一种方法来确保特征级关系反映类一致的预测行为。

Method: 在任意深度引入参数无关的图一致性层(GCLs)，构建批次级特征相似图并与全局类感知掩码预测图对齐，通过自适应权重学习层重要性，优先处理语义可靠的层。

Result: GCR在多种网络和数据集上改善了语义结构，促进了更清晰的特征结构、更强的类内凝聚力和改进的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GCR提供了一种从预测结构学习的新视角，是模型无关、轻量级的方法，能在不修改架构或训练过程的情况下提升特征质量。

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

TL;DR: 本文提出Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL)方法，通过改进离散扩散模型的训练目标来解决规划器在推理时引入的训练-推理不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过灵活的并行生成路径实现快速推理，但规划器修改反向路径会导致训练时的均匀随机去噪路径与推理时的规划路径不匹配。

Method: 推导出新的Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO)，将基于规划器的反向动态直接纳入训练目标，并提出PAPL方法修改标准掩码离散扩散损失。

Result: PAPL在不同领域均带来一致改进：蛋白质序列建模相对提升40%，文本生成MAUVE指标提升达4倍，代码生成HumanEval pass@10相对提升23%。

Conclusion: PAPL通过将规划器感知的路径学习纳入训练目标，有效解决了扩散模型中训练-推理不匹配问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel
generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or
planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather
than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths,
planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used
during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work,
we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the
standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not
accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap,
we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly
incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective.
Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and
effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that
aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL
delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain
in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text
generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么合并图层要么独立处理图层，这会丢失关键的层间依赖关系且难以扩展。需要一种能够有效利用层间依赖关系并具有良好可扩展性的多重图链接预测方法。

Method: 将多重链接预测构建为多视图边缘分类问题，为每个节点对构建每层边缘视图序列，应用跨层自注意力融合目标层证据。提出了Trans-SLE（基于静态嵌入的轻量级Transformer）和Trans-GAT（结合层特定GAT编码器和Transformer融合）两个模型，并引入Union-Set候选池和两种无泄漏协议。

Result: 在六个公共多重数据集上的实验显示，相比强基线方法（MELL、HOPLP-MUL、RMNE）在macro-F1指标上取得了持续提升。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，且兼容预计算嵌入和GNN编码器，有效解决了多重图链接预测中层间依赖关系利用和可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most
predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses
crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome
this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For
each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply
cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present
two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer
over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT
encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we
introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols:
cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public
multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL,
HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both
precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型剪枝方法面临两难：非结构化稀疏保持准确性但无法GPU加速，而2:4稀疏硬件友好但强制50%模式会降低模型质量。需要一种能平衡准确性和加速的解决方案。

Method: 将权重矩阵划分为块，通过可学习的掩码选择机制为每个块分配为密集或2:4稀疏，支持跨层非均匀稀疏分布，实现细粒度控制。

Result: 在0.5B到8B参数模型中，PATCH持续缩小与密集模型的准确性差距并提供实际加速。在LLaMA-2 7B上，相比密集基线实现1.18x-1.38x端到端加速，相比最先进的2:4剪枝方法MaskLLM准确性提升0.37%-2.96%。

Conclusion: PATCH框架成功平衡了模型准确性和计算效率，为大型语言模型的部署提供了有效的稀疏化解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur
prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an
effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face
challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere,
preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU
acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but
enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap,
we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous
sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles,
assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask
selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over
accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across
layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B
parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while
delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,
PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while
improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning
method, MaskLLM.

Conclusion: URS是首个能够使用单一模型处理超过100种VRP变体的神经求解器，在零样本泛化方面表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for
their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single
model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem
constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits
their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this
critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of
zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single
model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data
representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification,
thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain
expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently
learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top
of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively
adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot
generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction
mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise
masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more
than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more
than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural
solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.

TL;DR: LOTFormer是一种同时具备线性时间复杂度和双重随机性的注意力机制，通过将注意力映射建模为查询和键之间的传输计划，并约束传输计划为低秩，实现了高效且平衡的注意力计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax注意力机制存在二次复杂度问题，限制了其在长上下文窗口中的扩展性。同时，大多数注意力机制产生行归一化映射，可能导致过度关注少数token，降低鲁棒性和信息流。现有双重随机注意力机制虽然能平衡token参与度，但通常引入显著开销，影响可扩展性。

Method: 利用注意力映射与查询和键测量之间传输计划的联系，通过约束传输计划为低秩来实现双重随机注意力。具体方法：解决两个熵最优传输问题（查询→枢轴和枢轴→键），并将它们组合成条件耦合，产生秩最多为r≪n的注意力矩阵，在O(nr)时间内应用而不形成完整的n×n映射。枢轴位置和质量通过端到端学习得到。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中达到最先进结果，在准确性和效率方面均优于先前的线性和基于传输的注意力方法。

Conclusion: LOTFormer提供了一种原则性的注意力机制，同时实现了线性时间复杂度和双重随机性，为长序列建模提供了高效且平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities.
However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism
poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large
body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention
as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve
linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention
mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can
over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow.
Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token
participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention
mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability.
We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously
linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between
attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The
central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning
it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two
entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys)
and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention
matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and
applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map.
The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing
prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and

*Steve Hong,Runa Eschenhagen,Bruno Mlodozeniec,Richard Turner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Hessian矩阵近似质量对影响函数数据归因性能的影响，发现更好的Hessian近似能产生更准确的影响分数，并分解了不同近似步骤对归因准确性的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 影响函数为追踪模型预测到训练数据提供了理论方法，但在深度学习中需要处理大型、病态的Hessian矩阵求逆问题。现有近似方法如GGN和K-FAC虽然使计算可行，但尚不清楚这些近似对数据归因性能的具体影响。

Method: 在受控分类设置下，研究Hessian近似质量对影响函数归因的影响，分解近期Hessian近似方法的各个步骤，并评估每个步骤对归因准确性的影响。

Result: 实验表明，更好的Hessian近似能一致地产生更好的影响分数质量。K-FAC特征值与GGN/EK-FAC特征值之间的不匹配是误差和影响损失的主要原因。

Conclusion: 研究结果为改进Hessian近似的研究提供了合理性，并指明了哪些近似步骤最为关键，为未来在计算可行性和归因准确性之间取得平衡提供了指导。

Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to
training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert
a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised
Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have
been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear
how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance.
Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are
derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even
lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a
controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian
approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering
justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further
decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and
evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch
between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority
of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations
are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability
and attribution accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过因子去相关和损失扰动来增强深度预测模型的数据移除方法，在保护用户隐私的同时保持模型性能，特别是在分布外场景下


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户隐私保护和法规合规要求从模型训练中移除敏感数据，但这一过程通常会导致分布偏移，从而损害模型性能，特别是在分布外场景下

Method: 引入判别保持因子去相关模块（使用动态自适应权重调整和迭代表示更新）和平滑数据移除机制（通过损失扰动创建信息论防护）

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于其他基线方法，即使在显著分布偏移下也能持续实现高预测准确性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法在分布内和分布外场景下都表现出卓越的效率和适应性

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance
necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often
induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach
that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss
perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor
decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative
representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature
correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that
creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal
operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our
approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive
accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results
highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHASE是一个模块化深度学习框架，通过物理集成和异构数据感知的代理模型，将地球系统模型中的生物地球化学自旋过程从1200年加速到仅需20年，实现60倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模数值模拟计算成本高昂，现有AI代理模型在关键任务应用中存在物理合理性、可信度和异构数据融合的局限性。

Method: PHASE结合异构输入的数据类型感知编码器和多级物理约束，从局部动力学到全局系统行为保持一致性，并开发了融合异构科学数据的流程。

Result: 在E3SM陆地模型中，仅使用前20年模拟数据就能推断出原本需要1200年积分才能达到的近平衡状态，有效减少积分长度至少60倍，且能很好泛化到更高空间分辨率。

Conclusion: PHASE捕捉了支配物理规律而非表面相关性，为陆地表面建模和其他复杂科学工作流程提供了实用且物理一致的加速方案。

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but
remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer
acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns
over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous
data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for
physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations.
PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with
multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local
dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical
(BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth
System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first
scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the
first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise
requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction
in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a
pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong
generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These
results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather
than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent
acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过识别对训练有显著贡献的信息数据样本，在保持性能的同时加速学习过程

Method: 基于损失动态和增强损失差异进行批次级数据选择，支持灵活的频率调整，并可扩展为结合集合级数据选择的ESWP方法

Result: 在各类预训练和后训练任务中实现无损训练加速，节省高达45%的挂钟时间

Conclusion: 该方法为现代大规模机器学习的数据效率研究提供了新的思路和方向

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance.
To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples
with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for
\emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em
batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented
\emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and
hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model
performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to
incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning,
\textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP)
consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various
pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time.
Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of
modern large-scale machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEMS是一个无需代理模型的生成式进化元求解器，用紧凑的潜在锚点和单一摊销生成器替代显式策略群体，通过蒙特卡洛模拟和元动态实现比PSRO快6倍、内存减少1.3倍的高效多智能体强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于群体的多智能体强化学习方法（如PSRO）需要存储显式策略群体和构建完整收益矩阵，导致二次计算和线性内存成本的问题。

Method: 使用紧凑潜在锚点和单一摊销生成器替代显式群体；基于无偏蒙特卡洛模拟、乘法权重元动态和无模型经验伯恩斯坦UCB预言机自适应扩展策略集；在生成器内使用基于优势的信任域目标训练最佳响应。

Result: 在双人和多人游戏中，GEMS比PSRO快约6倍，内存使用减少1.3倍，同时获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: GEMS在保持PSRO博弈论保证的同时，克服了其基本低效性，实现了多个领域的可扩展多智能体学习。

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central
challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response
Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing
full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs.
We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free
framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent
anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing
the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,
multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB
oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within
the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the
need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of
Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn
Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,
has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards
simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic
guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence
enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为POC的框架，用于在实时操作中决定何时重新求解MILP优化问题，平衡性能与计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时操作中需要频繁求解计算密集的MILP问题，但何时重新求解是一个经济上重要的问题。现有方法主要关注启发式、低数据设置和平滑目标，对常见的NP-hard MILP问题关注不足。

Method: 提出了POC框架（Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection），结合了近端策略优化和变化点检测，系统性地解决重新求解时机的决策问题。

Result: 在8个合成和真实数据集上的测试表明，POC始终优于现有基线方法2%-17%。

Conclusion: POC框架有效解决了MILP重新求解的时机决策问题，同时填补了实时MILP基准测试和评估标准的文献空白。

Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an
optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data
platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time
operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization
problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when
to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem
poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and
solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial
samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP
structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly
applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing
literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth
objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework
called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which
systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when
deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the
relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test
our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show
that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side
benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP
benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

TL;DR: Drift-Adapter是一种轻量级可学习转换层，通过将新查询映射到旧嵌入空间，避免生产向量数据库升级时重新编码整个语料库和重建ANN索引，显著降低操作中断和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产向量数据库升级嵌入模型通常需要重新编码整个语料库并重建近似最近邻索引，导致严重的操作中断和计算成本。

Method: 提出Drift-Adapter轻量级可学习转换层，使用三种适配器参数化方法（正交Procrustes、低秩仿射、紧凑残差MLP），在少量新旧嵌入对样本上训练，将新查询映射到旧嵌入空间。

Result: 在MTEB文本语料库和CLIP图像模型升级实验中，Drift-Adapter恢复了95-99%的检索召回率，仅增加不到10微秒的查询延迟，相比完全重新索引减少100倍以上的重新计算成本。

Conclusion: Drift-Adapter是敏捷模型部署的实用解决方案，能够以接近零操作中断的方式促进模型升级，并在十亿级系统中具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires
re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational
cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable
transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model
versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter
enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full
re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations:
Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on
a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text
corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter
recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full
re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to
operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving,
Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates
upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to
varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems,
and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating
Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LoRAct的内存高效微调方法，通过低秩激活压缩显著减少内存开销，在保持性能的同时将激活内存降低约80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有许多参数高效微调方法减少了可训练参数数量，但它们的内存开销仍然很大，特别是在大批量和长上下文场景下，这阻碍了实际部署。作者观察到模型激活是内存消耗的主要来源，但其秩始终保持较低水平。

Method: LoRAct采用低秩激活压缩策略，可以在前向传播过程中在线应用，无需任何校准数据。该方法包含一种新颖的基于采样的正交分解算法，专门为低秩矩阵设计，相比广泛使用的RSVD具有更好的计算效率和更紧的误差界。

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上的实验表明LoRAct的有效性。与广泛采用的LoRA方法相比，LoRAct进一步减少了约80%的激活内存，同时保持了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: LoRAct提供了一种灵活通用的压缩策略，能够显著降低内存开销，为参数高效微调的实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant
attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods
have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their
substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders
practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations
constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch
sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains
consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient
fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior
work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that
can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any
calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based
orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices,
offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared
to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces
activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted
LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance. The source code is

TL;DR: 该论文分析了群不变神经网络在Barron框架下的泛化误差，证明了群不变结构通过引入群相关因子δ≤1来提升近似精度，同时不影响估计误差，从而在对称目标函数上获得统计优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究群不变神经网络的理论基础，验证在具有内在群对称性的函数学习中，编码群不变结构是否能带来统计优势。

Method: 在Barron框架下分析群不变神经网络的泛化误差，通过理论推导证明近似误差和估计误差的变化规律。

Result: 群不变结构引入因子δ≤1改善近似精度，同时Rademacher复杂度不增加，因此泛化误差在对称函数学习中得到显著提升。

Conclusion: 编码群不变结构为神经网络提供了明确的统计优势，特别是在学习具有群对称性的目标函数时。

Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks
within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating
group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor
is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation
accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity
of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant
counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the
incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve
significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We
further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous
theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in
neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target
functions.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在数据分布变化时性能下降，作者想探究仅使用过去数据能否实现对未来数据的有效泛化。

Method: 探索了两种主要方法：参数插值（过去模型参数的凸组合）和参数外推（超越过去参数凸包的显式外推），在多个时序任务上进行了基准测试。

Result: 所有评估方法都无法在所有场景中持续优于简单使用最新模型参数的基线方法。

Conclusion: 在没有未来数据访问或对数据生成过程的稳健假设时，泛化和外推到未来数据存在固有困难，需要谨慎评估此类泛化声明。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，CRIB在高缺失率下仍能准确预测

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time
series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of
research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing
data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework
that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting
on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there
is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process
susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct
supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade
prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves
away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time
series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a
novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a
unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to
learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values
while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts
accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in
https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.

Motivation: 随着新优化器的流行和模型量化成为高效部署标准，需要系统研究优化器选择如何影响量化后的模型性能，填补优化器-量化交互关系的证据空白。

Method: 首先训练全精度模型（50M到1.5B参数）并使用六种优化器探索超参数空间，建立良好调优的基线。然后应用后训练量化评估不同优化器训练模型的性能退化，并研究量化感知训练中的性能表现。

Result: 发现与异常值相关的指标无法预测不同优化器的PTQ性能；在QAT中，Shampoo优化器显示出最低的准确率退化；推导了不同优化器下量化感知训练的缩放定律，显示Shampoo达到所有测试优化器中最高的参数效率。

Conclusion: 优化器选择对量化模型性能有显著影响，Shampoo在量化感知训练中表现最优，为高效模型部署提供了重要指导。

Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for
efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer
affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in
both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains
limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model
robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization
(PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision
models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore
the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply
PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different
optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio
(MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different
optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only
isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and
propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized
models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We
find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not
remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest
accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware
training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest
parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

Conclusion: IDMVAE通过互补的组件设计，有效解决了多模态表示学习中的信息分离问题，为多模态生成任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust
representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and
downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among
different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and
private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite
attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods
struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient.
In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to
explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based
regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for
extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy
removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models
to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are
complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a
clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior
generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: 融合序列感知1D CNN和特征学习XGBoost的集成方法克服了单独使用无序特征模型或序列模型的局限性，创建了强大的抗生素耐药性预测框架。

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis.
While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes,
current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning
models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the
sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art
sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally
expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To
address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework
that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We
developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data.
This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful
gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature
interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of
809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying
class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier
performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro
F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also
show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes
like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for
resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a
feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the
limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

TL;DR: MosaCD是一种因果发现方法，结合CI测试和LLM标注来生成高置信度种子边，通过置信度下降传播策略构建更准确的因果图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束方法如PC在CI测试不完美时会产生级联错误，而现有LLM方法假设完美专家，不适用于易产生幻觉的LLM。

Method: 使用打乱查询过滤LLM幻觉，保留高置信度种子，采用置信度下降传播策略优先定向最可靠的边。

Result: 在多个真实世界图上，MosaCD比现有约束方法在最终图构建中达到更高准确率。

Conclusion: MosaCD通过改进初始种子可靠性和鲁棒传播策略，显著提升了因果发现性能。

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific
modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover
conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient
v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds,
assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets --
assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the
final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as
experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge
orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly
assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We
propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a
high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To
filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs'
positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel
confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges
first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across
multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph
construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the
improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.

TL;DR: EVO-LRP使用CMA-ES进化策略优化LRP超参数，基于可解释性指标提升归因质量，在视觉一致性和类特定特征敏感性方面优于传统XAI方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统XAI方法在细节和可解释性之间存在权衡，LRP实现通常依赖启发式规则集，未针对清晰度或模型行为对齐进行优化。

Method: 应用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略(CMA-ES)来调整LRP超参数，基于定量可解释性指标如忠实度或稀疏度进行优化。

Result: EVO-LRP在可解释性指标性能和视觉一致性方面优于传统XAI方法，对类特定特征表现出强敏感性。

Conclusion: 归因质量可以通过原则性的、任务特定的优化系统性地提升。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SKETCHLORD方法同时估计低秩和对角分量，针对低秩加对角线性算子，通过联合估计优于任何顺序变体，并转化为凸优化问题实现可扩展算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多机器学习和科学计算任务涉及高维线性算子，只能通过昂贵的矩阵-向量乘积访问。现有方法只能构建低秩或对角近似，但存在近似误差。

Method: 将SKETCHLORD转化为凸优化问题，实现同时估计低秩和对角分量的可扩展算法。

Result: 在合成LoRD矩阵上的综合实验证实了SKETCHLORD在准确恢复这些结构方面的性能。

Conclusion: SKETCHLORD是结构化近似工具包的有价值补充，特别适用于需要高保真近似的大规模算子，如深度学习Hessian矩阵。

Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve
high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector
products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the
construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few
matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but
approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work
introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank
*and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus*
Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically
that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant
(diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as
a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's
performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a
valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when
high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the
deep learning Hessian.

*Hoang Phan,Sungmin Cha,Tung Lam Tran,Qi Lei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个持续模型融合的整体框架，在融合前、融合中和融合后三个阶段进行干预，解决持续学习中的两个基本挑战：可扩展性和功能信息丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么维护不断增长的每个领域的任务向量列表导致可扩展性问题，要么在无法访问旧数据时仅依赖权重空间融合从而丢失关键功能信息。

Method: 首先在切线空间中对主模型进行领域特定数据的微调以增强任务间权重解耦；在融合过程中利用优化器状态的功能信息；最后通过融合后校正对齐表示差异。

Result: 在标准类增量和领域增量基准测试中，该方法不仅实现了有竞争力的性能，而且为灾难性遗忘问题提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该框架在恒定内存约束下运行且无需访问历史数据，有效缓解了任务间干扰，减少了偏差并提升了整体性能。

Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes
at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to
address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular,
conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task
vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging
when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information.
Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model
within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies
per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task
interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available
optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit
old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation
discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing
overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints
without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard
class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable
and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

*Zekun Wang,Anant Gupta,Zihan Dong,Christopher J. MacLellan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合重放和秩1 EWC的持续学习方法，利用扩散模型在低信噪比下梯度共线性的特性，有效缓解灾难性遗忘问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，现有方法如重放和弹性权重巩固(EWC)存在局限性：重放需要强生成器且易分布漂移，EWC假设任务间共享最优解且使用对角Fisher近似

Method: 利用扩散模型在低信噪比下梯度共线性的特性，提出秩1 EWC变体，结合重放方法鼓励参数共享并减轻漂移

Result: 在类增量图像生成数据集上，相比仅重放和对角EWC基线，平均FID提升，遗忘显著减少，在MNIST和FashionMNIST上几乎消除遗忘，在ImageNet-1k上减少约一半

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有近似秩1的Fisher矩阵，改进的Fisher估计使EWC成为重放的有力补充：重放鼓励参数共享，EWC有效约束重放引起的漂移

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in
neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation
(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to
distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across
tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we
study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce
high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,
in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become
strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and
aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1
variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the
dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach
to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On
class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,
ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces
forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular,
forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved
on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an
approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a
strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks,
while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

Conclusion: 将线性系统的经典理论与现代学习技术相结合，有望构建鲁棒、可解释且数据高效的时间序列预测模型。

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains,
yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across
datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple
linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant
deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of
linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of
characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free
setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and
explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel
independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the
noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads
to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence
of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need
for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two
complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank
reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank
Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel
adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a
noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our
theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several
settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical
theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust,
interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GraphIFE框架来解决图数据中的类别不平衡问题，通过图不变特征提取来缓解合成节点质量不一致的问题，提升模型在少数类上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络通常假设类别分布平衡，但在实际图数据中存在类别不平衡问题，导致对少数类的学习偏差和性能下降。作者发现合成节点存在质量不一致问题，这是影响图不平衡条件下性能的关键因素。

Method: 提出GraphIFE框架，结合图不变学习的两个关键概念，采用策略来增强嵌入空间表示，从而提升模型识别不变特征的能力。

Result: 大量实验表明GraphIFE具有高效性和鲁棒泛化能力，在多个数据集上持续优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphIFE通过解决合成节点质量不一致问题，有效缓解了图数据中的类别不平衡问题，提高了模型在少数类上的性能表现。

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of
samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes
are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a
balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the
challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and
degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency
problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph
imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph
Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality
inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts
from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the
embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to
identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's
efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms
various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时空克里金法的训练评估设置存在信息泄露问题，且分布外泛化能力较差，无法准确反映真实应用场景。

Method: 采用3x3数据划分消除信息泄露，提出DRIK方法：扰动节点坐标捕捉连续空间关系、随机丢弃边减少信息流模糊性、添加伪标记子图增强领域泛化。

Result: 在6个时空数据集上实验表明，DRIK相比现有方法MAE降低高达12.48%，且保持良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: DRIK通过改进的数据划分和多层次增强策略，显著提升了时空克里金法的分布外泛化性能。

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with
sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often
suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test
data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true
OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a
3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets,
eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on
this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive
Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in
mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy
at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to
capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in
information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled
subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse
spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

three key challenges: inaccurate activation prediction, PCIe bandwidth
competition, and cross-device scheduling complexity. Our solution includes: 1)
Learnable Layer-Aware Predictor (LLaPor) that captures layer-specific expert
activation patterns; 2) Prefetch-Aware Cross-Layer Scheduling (PreSched) that
generates globally optimal plans balancing prefetching costs and loading
overhead; 3) Asynchronous I/O Optimizer (AsyncIO) that decouples I/O from

Conclusion: VN-HGCN不仅能够有效解决异质图中的长距离信息捕获问题，还可以作为通用框架无缝应用于其他异质图神经网络模型，具有良好的泛化性。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful
performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from
various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models
often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking
numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational
complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a
Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which
leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the
graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a
specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range
information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual
nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information
aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can
serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN
models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the
effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity
among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly
underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the
assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In
our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness
Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are
affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To
eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure
Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing
approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity
imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that
operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also
alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node
neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are
influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of
unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various
benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of
probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their
prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains
elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and
model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model
predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay
between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of
post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic
regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds,
and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we
explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance
through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a
diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating
consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By
examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing
only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise
dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability
of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics
and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical
understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification. Code

Conclusion: UAT框架能有效平衡计算效率和预测质量，提供风险保证，在多种任务上展现一致的性能提升

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing
prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs
and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an
intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined
threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the
model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to
distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model
trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that
adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework,
enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions
based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its
reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while
penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by
UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language
understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates
consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop
(<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 当前偏好对齐通常先在紧凑的知识蒸馏模型上进行，但这种方法忽略了参考模型的分布召回率特性，导致无法有效对齐稀有但期望的行为。

Method: 提出Align->KD新流程：先在具有高召回率的参考模型上进行偏好对齐，然后再进行知识蒸馏。通过理论分析、可控高斯混合实验和LLM对齐实验验证。

Result: 在SmolLM2系列实验中，KD->Align流程的模型无法有效对齐目标行为，奖励和目标精度显著降低；而Align->KD流程能稳健对齐这些行为，获得更优的目标导向指标和更低方差。

Conclusion: 参考模型的召回率是对齐中的首要设计选择，必须遵循"对齐先于蒸馏"的原则。

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact,
knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a
significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's
reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD ->
Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable
behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that
reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first
be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the
reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental
level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians
experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model
performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM
alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively
align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target
precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these
behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower
variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a
first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment
must precede distillation.

TL;DR: 提出Hermes框架用于股票时间序列预测，通过超图网络中的移动聚合和多尺度融合模块，更好地捕捉行业间的领先-滞后关系和多尺度信息，在多个真实股票数据集上表现出优于现有方法的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股票时间序列具有行业相关性，现有基于超图的方法只能相对表面地捕捉这种相关性，存在两个关键限制：未充分考虑行业间的领先-滞后交互，以及未建模行业内部和之间的多尺度信息。

Method: Hermes框架在超图网络中集成移动聚合和多尺度融合模块。移动聚合模块使用滑动窗口和动态时间聚合操作来捕捉行业间的领先-滞后关系；多尺度融合通过跨尺度、边到边的消息传递来整合不同尺度的信息。

Result: 在多个真实世界股票数据集上的实验结果表明，Hermes在效率和准确性方面都优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Hermes框架通过更好地利用行业相关性，特别是通过捕捉领先-滞后关系和多尺度信息，显著提升了股票时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing
essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and
analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series
exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve
forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only
capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two
key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag
interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among
industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series
forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by
eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and
multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more
flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a
hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding
window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider
lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model
multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message
passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the
consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock
datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出DIMIGNN模型，通过多样性感知邻居选择和动态多尺度融合解决多元时间序列预测中邻居信息冗余和单时间尺度依赖问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN方法忽视邻居间信息多样性导致冗余信息聚合，且仅依赖单一时间尺度表示进行预测

Method: 引入多样性感知邻居选择机制确保变量与邻居高信息相似性同时保持邻居间多样性；提出动态多尺度融合模块动态调整不同时间尺度预测结果的贡献

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明DIMIGNN持续优于先前方法

Conclusion: DIMIGNN通过邻居选择和尺度融合有效提升了多元时间序列预测性能

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance
of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their
capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may
lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction
typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To
tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with
Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN).
DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to
ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its
neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore,
a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust
the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the
final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对混合专家(MoE)模型的专用扩展定律，通过系统分解MoE设置，识别了5个关键影响因素，并构建了考虑所有必要因素的综合MoE扩展定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的密集模型扩展定律不适用于MoE模型，因为MoE模型存在影响因素多样性、复杂耦合关系和非单调性能影响三大挑战，需要专门研究MoE特定的扩展定律。

Method: 系统分解MoE设置，识别5个关键因素（数据大小D、总模型大小N、激活模型大小Na、激活专家数G、共享专家比例S），设计446个对照实验来表征其边际效应，构建联合MoE扩展定律。

Result: 发现G和S的最优设置与模型架构和数据大小无关，随着N的扩展，最优激活参数比例Na/N变得更稀疏。提出了理论和实践效率感知的最优配置。

Conclusion: 提出的MoE扩展定律可作为准确且具有洞察力的指导，促进未来MoE模型的设计和训练。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

Motivation: 联邦持续学习中新任务的出现带来了时间和跨客户端的分布偏移，导致灾难性遗忘问题。现有方法将客户端知识聚合到全局模型可能引入无关知识的干扰，特别是在异构场景下。

Conclusion: 提出的动态合作框架能够有效平衡新知识获取和旧知识保留，在联邦持续学习中实现更好的个性化模型性能。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its
ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data
distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and
cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most
existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may
not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce
interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly
applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group
formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a
decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish
dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new
knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized
models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective
cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance
gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of
the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition
relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and
model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We
also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution
algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various
baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

Method: 使用联盟博弈论框架，将神经元视为享乐博弈中的智能体，通过PAC-Top-Cover算法提取稳定的神经元联盟，追踪其在各层间的演化过程。

Result: 在LLaMA、Mistral和Pythia重排序器上的应用显示，该方法发现的神经元联盟比聚类基线具有更高协同性，揭示了超越解缠结的高阶结构。

Conclusion: 享乐联盟方法能够发现功能重要、可解释且跨领域预测的计算单元，为理解神经元如何协同编码特征提供了新视角。

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features,
but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains
unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features
concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures
meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may
strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how
neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional
game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences
capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using
top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable
coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We
then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging,
or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR
tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than
clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features,
hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and
yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and
predictive across domains.

Motivation: 医学影像领域受严格隐私法规限制，禁止原始数据共享。联邦学习虽然能保护隐私，但面临扫描仪引起的领域偏移问题。现有领域泛化方法需要集中访问多站点数据，违反联邦学习的隐私保证。

Method: 在联邦学习过程中集成领域对抗神经网络，提出近端正则化方法稳定客户端间的对抗训练，解决朴素联邦DANN无法收敛的问题。

Result: 在OpenBHB数据集上的实验表明，该方法在15个站点训练、19个未见站点测试时，相比FedAvg和ERM具有更好的跨站点泛化能力，同时保持数据隐私。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将领域对抗训练整合到联邦学习框架中，有效解决医学影像中的领域偏移问题，同时严格遵守隐私保护要求。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or
clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical
imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is
scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or
acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most
harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across
sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG)
offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations
without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized
access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets
these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial
Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive
federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method
that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted
3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on
participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79
y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15
sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization
over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

Result: 模型合并不能可靠防御迁移攻击，更强的模型合并方法反而增加对迁移攻击的脆弱性，权重平均是最脆弱的合并方法。

Conclusion: 模型合并会增加系统对迁移攻击的脆弱性，需要重新考虑其在安全系统设计中的应用，并提出了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task
learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to
tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across
tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks,
particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored
its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box
adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully
mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial
examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis
consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336
distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion
of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably
defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success
rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners
regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM
methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating
representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight
averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM
method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this
increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our
findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing
MM.

Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)数量的增加，在有限公共数据的领域中，高效识别最适合下游微调的最佳模型变得越来越具有挑战性。

Method: TimeTic将观察到的模型-数据关系作为上下文信息灵活组织，利用表格基础模型作为上下文学习器，并引入基于模型层间熵演化的新型模型特征化方法。

Result: 在包含10个数据集、10个基础模型和3个预测任务的综合基准测试中，TimeTic的估计与未见数据集的实际微调性能高度一致，平均秩相关约为0.6，相比使用零样本性能作为可迁移性得分提高了30%。

Conclusion: TimeTic能够有效预测时间序列基础模型在下游数据集上的微调性能，为模型选择提供了高效的可迁移性估计方法。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via
large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting
performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of
TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning
becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a
transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an
in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it
predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target)
dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as
contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time
scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset
meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ
tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce
a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,
capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize
across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for
transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3
forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong
alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,
achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement
compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

Conclusion: CT-DDPG为连续时间强化学习提供了有效的确定性策略梯度方法，解决了时间离散化敏感性问题，在实际应用中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly
over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments,
many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major
challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is
their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and
slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient
methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient
formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its
martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed
algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies
in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to
existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of
control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

FraudTransformer surpasses four strong classical baselines (Logistic
Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM) as well as transformer ablations that omit
either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers
the highest AUROC and PRAUC.

Conclusion: SAFDNet具有稳健的预测性能和低噪声敏感性，适合临床应用。

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative
complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making
its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial
intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing
methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain
information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise
sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet
integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to
extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to
mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to
capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive
internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning,
outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust
predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for
practical clinical applications.

Conclusion: GBSK和AGBSK算法能够有效处理大规模聚类任务，在保持准确性的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a
novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with
up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and

Motivation: 符号音乐生成面临效率与质量的基本权衡：细粒度分词能实现强连贯性但序列长、复杂度高，而紧凑分词提高效率但牺牲了词内依赖关系。

Method: 采用基于延迟的调度机制(DP)，将类复合词符在解码步骤中展开，使自回归模型能够建模词内依赖关系，同时保持效率。

Result: 在符号管弦乐MIDI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有指标上都优于标准复合分词，并缩小了与细粒度分词的差距。

Conclusion: DP是一种轻量级策略，无需额外参数即可无缝集成到现有表示中，有效平衡了符号音乐生成的效率与质量。

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency
and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long
sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency
at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a
delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across
decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies
while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that
introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show
that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and
narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

Result: MA-BN在RL设置中能够加速和稳定训练，扩大有效学习率范围，增强探索能力，并降低整体优化难度。

Conclusion: 通过适当的应用，BN能够适应不断变化的数据分布，提高收敛速度和最终性能，MA-BN为DRL管道中稳健集成BN提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep
learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling
more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data
and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning
process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains
unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and
its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to
evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final
performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use
of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how
different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify
failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying
causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with
practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL
pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates
and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances
exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty. Our code is available

*He Zhu,Junyou Su,Peng Lai,Ren Ma,Wenjia Zhang,Linyi Yang,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT)方法，通过KL正则化解决Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT)的不稳定性问题，在数学推理、医学知识基础和代码生成等任务上优于SFT和DFT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SFT容易记忆化而RL计算成本高的问题，DFT作为折中方案在某些领域表现良好但不稳定，需要改进其稳定性。

Method: 基于reward-weighted regression (RWR)框架分析DFT，发现其缺乏分布锚定导致训练不稳定，提出ASFT方法，在DFT重加权基础上增加轻量级KL正则化来保持紧致性并确保稳定性。

Result: ASFT在数学推理、医学知识基础和代码生成任务上一致优于SFT和DFT，取得显著改进且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: RWR框架为理解后训练方法提供了系统性视角，表明原则性理论分析既能带来更强的理论保证也能获得实际收益。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

TL;DR: SHAPoint是一个新颖的任务无关框架，将梯度提升树的预测准确性与基于点的风险评分可解释性相结合，支持分类、回归和生存任务，具有灵活性高、运行速度快的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的可解释风险评分方法依赖手动预处理、任务特定建模和简化假设，限制了其灵活性和预测能力。

Method: SHAPoint框架整合了梯度提升树的预测准确性和基于点的风险评分的可解释性，支持多种任务类型，并继承了树模型的优势特性如缺失数据处理和单调约束支持。

Result: 实证结果显示SHAPoint生成的评分紧凑且可解释，预测性能与最先进方法相当，但运行时间大幅减少。

Conclusion: SHAPoint是透明且可扩展风险分层的强大工具，在保持预测性能的同时显著提升了运行效率。

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet
traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual
preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit
their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel,
task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient
boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint
supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting
valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing
data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks,
SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing,
and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces
compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a
powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLMs中知识的结构组织，发现存在知识同质性模式，即LLMs对图中位置相近的实体倾向于拥有相似的知识水平。基于此提出了GNN回归模型来估计实体级知识性得分，用于优化主动标注和推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知神经科学发现（如语义聚类和启动效应）启发，研究LLMs中是否存在类似的知识同质性模式，即了解一个事实会增加回忆相关事实的可能性。

Method: 将LLM知识映射为图表示，通过三元组和实体级知识检查分析知识性关系。提出GNN回归模型来估计实体级知识性得分，利用邻域得分预测知识性。

Result: 发现LLMs确实存在知识同质性模式，对位置相近的实体具有相似的知识水平。提出的方法能在相同标注预算下最大化知识覆盖，提高主动标注效率和多跳路径检索性能。

Conclusion: LLMs中存在知识同质性模式，基于此的GNN方法能有效估计知识性，优化知识注入和推理任务，为LLMs作为神经知识库的应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba作为Transformer的高效替代模型，在长序列建模中表现出色，但其上下文学习能力的理论理解仍然有限，阻碍了对该模型机制的深入理解。

Method: 通过开发针对Mamba结构非凸优化的新技术，分析了Mamba在线性回归上下文学习任务中的训练动态，建立了指数收敛率。

Result: 证明了Mamba能够以指数收敛率达到上下文学习解，损失界与Transformer相当，并发现Mamba通过在线梯度下降机制学习潜在函数。

Conclusion: Mamba通过在线梯度下降机制实现上下文学习，这与Transformer的机制不同，为理解Mamba的上下文学习能力提供了理论基础。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient
Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling.
Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large
foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains
limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even
fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard
theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in
the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of
Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques
tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's
structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and
derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our
results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient
descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different
from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through
gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by
experimental simulation.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了Visual CoT在图像噪声下的鲁棒性，发现虽然Visual CoT能提升准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感。通过分析识别编辑图像块是脆弱性主要来源，并提出集成Grounding DINO的增强方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual CoT技术通过显式视觉编辑增强了多模态推理性能，但其在图像级噪声下的鲁棒性尚未被探索，需要系统评估。

Method: 构建包含12种图像损坏类型的基准测试，在4个VQA数据集上比较使用和不使用Visual CoT的VLMs。通过分析识别脆弱性来源，并提出集成Grounding DINO的插件式增强方法。

Result: Visual CoT在干净和噪声图像上都能提升绝对准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感，性能下降更明显。编辑图像块是脆弱性的主要来源。

Conclusion: 揭示了Visual CoT的明确脆弱性模式，并提供了有效的架构无关解决方案来增强视觉鲁棒性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates
explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into
the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the
robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains
unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual
CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image
corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a
comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do
not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves
absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted
by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations,
resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through
extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual
CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility.
Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement
method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline,
providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work
reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective,
architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

TL;DR: 提出SAE-RSV方法，利用稀疏自编码器从有限数据中学习更有效的控制向量，通过语义去噪和特征增强来提升大语言模型的操控效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有控制方法依赖大规模数据集，但在实际场景中数据有限，从少量数据提取的控制向量包含任务无关噪声特征，影响效果。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器对控制向量进行语义去噪，移除任务无关特征，并通过语义相似性增强任务相关特征。

Result: 实验表明SAE-RSV显著优于所有基线方法，包括监督微调，能够从有限数据构建有效的控制向量。

Conclusion: 通过SAEs精炼原始控制向量，可以从有限训练数据中构建有效的控制向量，提升大语言模型的操控性能。

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language
models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing
steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral
information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The
steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant
noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering
vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector
via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise
and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove
task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and
then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their
semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the
baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that
effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by
refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

TL;DR: 提出STAIR方法解决多阶段任务中偏好学习阶段错位问题，通过时间距离学习阶段划分，优先同阶段比较，提升策略学习效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段任务中，偏好学习存在阶段错位问题：比较不同阶段（如移动vs操作）的片段会产生无效反馈，阻碍策略学习

Method: STAIR方法：基于时间距离学习阶段近似，通过对比学习将时间相近状态分组为连贯阶段，无需预定义任务知识，能动态适应策略变化，优先同阶段内比较

Result: 实验证明STAIR在多阶段任务中表现优越，在单阶段任务中也有竞争力；人类研究表明STAIR近似的阶段与人类认知一致

Conclusion: STAIR能有效缓解阶段错位问题，提升多阶段任务中偏好强化学习的效果

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward
engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling
better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in
multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g.,
navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments
from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in
uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we
validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and
empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward
learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal
distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance
is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into
coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to
policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in
multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks.
Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are
consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating
stage misalignment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于智能代理的联邦学习框架，旨在解决医疗领域联邦学习部署中的操作挑战，包括客户端选择、协调、数据预处理、数据标准化和算法选择等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的联邦学习部署面临复杂的操作挑战，需要大量人工干预，包括客户端选择、协调、数据预处理、数据标准化和算法选择等。现有工作忽视了这些实际协调挑战，因此需要自主的、基于代理的联邦学习系统。

Method: 引入了一个基于代理的联邦学习框架，涵盖从客户端选择到训练完成的真实世界联邦学习工作流程的关键阶段，并创建了FedAgentBench基准来评估LLM代理自主协调医疗联邦学习的能力。该框架包含40种联邦学习算法，针对不同的任务特定需求和跨客户端特征进行定制。

Conclusion: 基于智能代理的联邦学习框架可以显著减少医疗联邦学习部署中的人工干预，但复杂任务仍然需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了RLVR中探索与利用必须权衡的传统观点，提出这种权衡可能是测量层面的假象。通过转向隐藏状态空间分析，发现探索与利用可以解耦，并开发了VERL方法实现二者的协同增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视RLVR中探索与利用的权衡关系，认为传统基于token级指标的观点可能不是根本约束，而是测量层面的假象，希望通过隐藏状态空间分析揭示更本质的机制。

Method: 提出VERL方法，在隐藏状态空间使用有效秩(ER)量化探索，并引入其导数ERV和ERA来捕捉利用动态。通过直接塑造RL优势函数，利用理论稳定的ERA作为预测元控制器，创建协同的双通道激励结构。

Result: 实验显示VERL在不同LLM和推理基准上取得一致提升，在具有挑战性的Gaokao 2024数据集上实现了高达21.4%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 探索与利用在隐藏状态层面可以解耦，这为同时增强两种能力提供了机会。VERL方法成功实现了探索与利用的协同增强，打破了传统的权衡限制。

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tequila是一种针对大型语言模型的三元量化方法，通过将陷于死区的权重重新用作动态偏置，解决了传统三元量化导致的精度下降问题，在几乎不增加推理开销的情况下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有三元量化方法虽然能用加法替代乘法实现硬件高效部署，但会导致严重的精度损失，核心问题是死区陷阱现象——大量权重被困在死区边界，只能接收到噪声梯度而无法稳定逃离。

Method: 提出Tequila方法，将陷于死区的权重重新用作动态偏置，这样在前向传播中能提供连续信号，在反向传播中能接收到直接有意义的梯度信号，从而增强模型容量和优化效果。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于最先进的三元量化方法，在ARC基准上比SOTA基线提升>4%准确率，接近全精度性能（差距<1%），同时实现3.0倍推理加速。

Conclusion: Tequila为在资源受限环境中部署先进LLM提供了高度实用和高效的实现方案。

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on
mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it
not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining
weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with
hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to
significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training
with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large
number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because
these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable
escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.
To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization
optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing
them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a
continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,
meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model
capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC
benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly
matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference
speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient
implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained
environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

TL;DR: 提出了IndexNet，一个基于MLP的多变量时间序列预测框架，通过索引嵌入模块利用时间戳和变量索引信息来提升长期周期模式捕捉能力和变量区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多忽略了时间戳和变量索引等描述性信息，这些信息包含丰富的上下文语义，有潜力提升多变量时间序列预测性能。

Method: IndexNet包含索引嵌入模块，由时间戳嵌入和通道嵌入组成：时间戳嵌入将时间戳转换为嵌入向量注入输入序列，通道嵌入为每个变量分配可训练的身份嵌入来区分异质变量。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，IndexNet在主流基准上达到可比性能，验证了时间感知和变量感知设计的有效性。

Conclusion: IndexNet展示了强大的泛化性和可解释性，这两个方面在当前多变量时间序列预测研究中尚未得到充分探索。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow
forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling
of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods
overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable
indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such
information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture
ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework
augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two
key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE).
Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them
into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture
long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a
unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model
to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized
predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable
performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and
visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality
and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF
research.

Motivation: 由于动态图数据分布随时间演变，训练好的DGNN在未见测试图上推理时面临显著性能不确定性，需要评估模型是否适合在特定测试图上使用

Method: 提出两阶段框架：(1)测试时动态图模拟，捕捉训练-测试分布差异作为监督信号；(2)DyGEval开发与训练，准确估计训练好的DGNN在测试时动态图上的性能

Result: 大量实验表明DyGEval能有效评估各种DGNN骨干网络在不同分布偏移下的动态图上的性能

Conclusion: DyGEval为解决动态图神经网络模型评估问题提供了有效解决方案，能够准确估计模型在未见测试图上的性能

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for
learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world
systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph
data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant
performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in
practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed
DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is
suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we
introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess
the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by
estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time.
Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed
DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage
framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the
training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an
evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates
the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an
effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different
dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

Motivation: 现有生成模型往往忽略晶体对称性约束，导致生成的晶体对称性不足且不现实。需要开发能够严格遵循空间群和Wyckoff位置约束的生成方法。

Method: 使用条件对称噪声基分布和群条件等变向量场，将原子运动限制在其初始Wyckoff位置，并通过高效的群平均方法实现对称化。

Result: 在晶体结构预测和从头生成基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成高度对称的稳定晶体，为晶体设计提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in
three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry
operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in
specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an
atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its
Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates
overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high
populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce
Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that
samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric,
stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process
on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a
conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned,
equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to
their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is
achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored
for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of
symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on
crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform
relevant ablations.

Result: 概念验证实验展示了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: ECD²G方法为离散数据生成提供了理论保证的新途径

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete
$\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for
data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering
theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a
circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We
interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a
circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A
neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the
probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target,
we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit
pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees
transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to
illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

TL;DR: 提出贝叶斯MoE路由框架，通过建模路由决策的概率分布来替代确定性路由，显著提升路由稳定性、校准性和OoD检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MoE架构的确定性路由机制存在脆弱性，导致模型校准不良和过度自信，系统无法识别自身知识边界。

Method: 系统研究三种方法：在权重空间、logit空间和选择空间引入原则性不确定性，构建贝叶斯路由框架。

Result: 在30亿参数MoE模型上的实验表明，该框架显著改善路由稳定性、分布内校准和分布外检测。

Conclusion: 通过改进核心架构组件，可以创建更可靠的不确定性信号，为构建更鲁棒和自知的LLMs提供实用路径。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive
yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic
routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness
is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in
systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured
\textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single,
deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution
over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families
of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of
the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space},
and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE
model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing
stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD)
detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural
component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work
provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building
more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know
what they don't know.

Conclusion: AD-RRL通过扩散模型的条件采样能力成功解决了强化学习中的鲁棒性问题，为处理环境不确定性提供了一种有效方法。

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by
leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have
recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate
full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of
step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample
from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage
conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in
environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce
Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides
the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training,
effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results
across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and
performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

TL;DR: DART是一个解耦的GUI智能体强化学习训练框架，通过异步模块设计解决了GUI环境中RL训练的低效问题，在OSWorld基准上取得了42.13%的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉语言模型的GUI智能体在自动化桌面和移动任务方面有潜力，但面临RL训练的两个主要挑战：与GUI环境的多轮交互速度慢，以及高质量智能体-环境交互数据不足。

Method: 提出DART框架，将训练系统分为四个异步模块：环境集群、滚动服务、数据管理器和训练器，实现非阻塞通信和异步训练。引入自适应数据管理方案，包括预收集成功轨迹、动态调整滚动参数、选择性训练高熵步骤和使用截断重要性采样。

Result: DART显著提升了系统效率：1.6倍GPU利用率、1.9倍训练吞吐量和5.5倍环境利用率。在OSWorld基准上，DART-GUI-7B模型达到42.13%的任务成功率，比基础模型提升14.61%，比开源SOTA高7.34%。

Conclusion: DART框架有效解决了GUI智能体RL训练的效率问题，通过解耦设计和自适应数据管理实现了显著的性能提升，为开源社区提供了有价值的贡献。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

*Simon Schrodi,Elias Kempf,Fazl Barez,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 语言模型在蒸馏过程中可以传递隐藏偏见，这种现象称为潜意识学习。研究发现潜意识学习不需要全局标记纠缠或logit泄漏，而是由一小部分分歧标记驱动，这些标记在具有不同偏见的教师模型会预测不同结果。通过屏蔽这些标记可以消除偏见传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型蒸馏过程中隐藏偏见传递的机制，特别是理解在硬蒸馏（学生只看到采样标记）情况下潜意识学习如何发生，而不仅仅是软蒸馏（学生看到完整的下一个标记分布）。

Method: 通过控制实验和机制分析，识别分歧标记的作用，测试屏蔽这些标记的效果，并分析不同层在潜意识学习中的重要性。

Result: 发现潜意识学习主要由分歧标记驱动，屏蔽这些标记可以消除偏见传递。早期层在潜意识学习中起关键作用，微调单个早期层就足以实现潜意识学习。潜意识学习很脆弱，小的改变如改写提示就能抑制它。

Conclusion: 潜意识学习不需要复杂的机制，而是由特定的分歧标记驱动，这些标记揭示了教师模型的隐藏偏见。理解这一机制有助于开发更安全、更可控的模型蒸馏方法。

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example,
a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the
training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is
called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft
distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token
distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where
the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how
does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through
controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that
subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.
Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where
teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out
these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,
divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,
finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal
learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small
changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习理论面临的关键挑战是解释基于梯度的优化方法在训练大规模复杂深度神经网络时的显著成功。虽然已经为少数特定架构证明了线性收敛性，但仍缺乏统一的理论。

Method: 提出了一个统一的理论框架，通过单一通用定理证明连续梯度下降（梯度流）在训练具有分段非零多项式激活函数或ReLU、sigmoid激活函数的神经网络时的线性收敛性。

Result: 该定理不仅覆盖了之前未知结果的架构，还在更弱的假设下整合了现有结果。理论预测与实际步长梯度下降方法的实证结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 这项工作为深度神经网络训练中的梯度优化方法提供了统一的理论基础，尽管结果仅在无限小步长极限下精确，但与实际梯度下降方法表现出良好的经验一致性。

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable
success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale,
complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has
been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still
evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear
convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while
training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or
ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general
theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously
unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While
our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal
step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the
predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于正则化的方法在长期LLM持续学习中失败，主要原因是微调过程中功能方向的漂移。

Method: DOC微调方法：追踪功能方向漂移并动态更新，调整新任务参数的梯度与历史功能方向正交。

Result: 在各种LLM持续学习基准测试中优于先前方法，有效减少灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 该方法为持续LLM微调提供了鲁棒工具，通过正交化梯度缓解新旧任务间的干扰。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-Gating方法，一种完全可微的结构化过参数化技术，通过将权重组分解为主权重向量和多个标量门控因子，解决了结构化稀疏正则化的不可微问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏正则化能有效压缩神经网络，但其不可微性使其与常规随机梯度下降不兼容，需要专门优化器或后处理剪枝，缺乏形式化保证。

Method: 将每个权重组分解为主权重向量和多个标量门控因子，通过可微的过参数化方式实现结构化稀疏。

Result: 证明D-Gating的局部最小值也是非光滑结构化L2,2/D惩罚的局部最小值，且目标函数在梯度流极限下以指数速度收敛到L2,2/D正则化损失。

Conclusion: D-Gating在理论上等价于解决原始组稀疏问题，但在学习动态上从非稀疏状态演进到稀疏优化，在视觉、语言和表格任务中均表现出优于直接优化结构化惩罚和传统剪枝基线的性能-稀疏度权衡。

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural
networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional
stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or
additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose
$D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits
each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating
factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local
minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show
that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the
$L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results
show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group
sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a
non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across
vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers
strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization
of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action
spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints
in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by
up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that

users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping
features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and
graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality
prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong
non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable,

Conclusion: HiViS通过有效处理视觉令牌，显著加速VLM推理，同时保持生成质量，为多模态模型的高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in
Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models
(VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs.
First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from
different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target
VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the
KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens
substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding
stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative
Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input
decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual
tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as
explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding
last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional
processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step
self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential
embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach
compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the
target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive
experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup,
confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for
maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models
store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning
information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free
guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at
sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual
information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately
connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the
popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In
doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum
mechanics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CorText框架将神经活动直接整合到LLM的潜在空间中，实现了与脑数据的开放式自然语言交互，能够生成准确的图像描述并回答详细问题，展示了从被动解码向生成式脑-语言接口的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经解码方法受限于静态、非交互的方式，无法实现与脑数据的自然语言交互。

Method: 基于fMRI数据训练，将神经活动直接嵌入LLM的潜在空间，支持开放式自然语言交互。

Result: 能够生成准确的图像描述，回答详细问题优于对照组，并实现零样本泛化到未见过的语义类别。

Conclusion: CorText标志着从被动神经解码向生成式、灵活脑-语言接口的重要转变。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction,
and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a
shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static,
non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates
neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended,
natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded
during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and
can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to
neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization
beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a
counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation.
These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible
interfaces between brain activity and language.

*John N. Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个通过减少需要验证的聚类数量来降低计算负载的框架，集成动态相似度索引阈值、监督调度和召回约束优化，在大规模地理空间分析中实现计算成本显著降低而不牺牲准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Shapely 2.0和Triton等工具能提高空间相似性计算效率，但在处理极大数据集时仍面临计算量过大的挑战，需要减少需要验证的聚类数量来降低计算负载。

Method: 集成动态相似度索引阈值、监督调度和召回约束优化，利用核密度估计动态确定相似度阈值，使用机器学习模型优先处理聚类，在满足用户定义的精度和召回要求下高效识别具有最高空间相似性的聚类。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法具有可扩展性和有效性，计算成本显著降低且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模地理空间分析提供了实用解决方案，通过减少验证聚类数量有效降低了计算负载。

Abstract: Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve
the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more
scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these
optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations
required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of
clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on
these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding,
supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently
identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting
user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine
learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial
reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental
results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a
practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

*Kaisen Yang,Lixuan He,Rushi Shah,Kaicheng Yang,Qinwei Ma,Dianbo Liu,Alex Lamb*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Explore-Execute Chain (E²C)框架，将推理过程解耦为探索阶段和执行阶段，显著提高计算效率、推理路径探索能力和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CoT方法将高层策略规划与低层逐步执行混在一起，导致计算效率低下、推理路径探索有限且可解释性差。

Method: 采用两阶段推理框架：探索阶段随机生成简洁的高层计划，执行阶段确定性执行选定计划；结合SFT和RL的两阶段训练方法。

Result: 在AIME'2024上达到58.1%准确率，仅需<10%的解码token；在医学基准上比标准SFT准确率提高14.5%，仅需3.5%的token。

Conclusion: E²C框架通过分离规划与执行，实现了高效推理、强泛化能力和更好的可解释性，显著降低了自一致性开销。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are
available at: https://github.com/yks23/Explore-Execute-Chain.git

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了DiBS-MTL方法，一种基于方向性谈判解决方案的多任务学习算法，能够抵抗任务损失的非仿射单调变换，避免某些任务主导训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多任务学习方法通过加权平均组合任务损失或梯度，但任务损失可能因非仿射单调变换而任意缩放，导致某些任务主导训练并降低整体性能。

Method: 基于合作博弈论中的方向性谈判解决方案(DiBS)，开发了DiBS-MTL方法，该方法对任务损失的非仿射单调变换具有不变性，并证明了在非凸多任务学习设置下的收敛性。

Result: 在标准多任务学习基准测试中，DiBS-MTL与最先进方法相比具有竞争力，同时对非仿射单调变换保持鲁棒性，而现有方法在这种变换下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: DiBS-MTL提供了一种有效的多任务学习方法，能够避免任务主导问题，并在非凸设置下保证收敛到帕累托稳定点。

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine
different task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These
methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require
access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central
challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled
relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade
overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the
Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions
immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task
loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex
MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under
standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto
stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL,
a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we
validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it
achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that
significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior
bargaining-inspired MTL methods. Code available at

*Rylan Schaeffer,Noam Levi,Andreas Kirsch,Theo Guenais,Brando Miranda,Elyas Obbad,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究验证了Chinchilla缩放定律的可靠性，发现尽管模型参数存在歧义，但关键结果（缩放定律估计和计算最优的token-参数比）不受影响，为领域提供了对Chinchilla作为语言模型缩放指南的重新信心。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chinchilla论文提出计算最优缩放原则，但后续研究对其有效性提出质疑，包括宽置信区间、方法间差异等问题。本研究旨在回答实践者是否仍可依赖Chinchilla的指导原则。

Method: 首先识别Chinchilla分析中模型参数的三种可能解释，然后通过四种结构化方式故意扰动模型参数，评估关键结果对这些扰动的敏感性。

Result: 发现模型参数的不同解释不影响关键结果；即使模型参数存在显著扰动，Chinchilla的关键结果仍能保持稳定，特别是最优token-参数比在大多数情况下保持平坦趋势。

Conclusion: Chinchilla的缩放定律是可靠的，可以作为语言模型缩放的持久指南，为领域提供了重新信心。

Abstract: Hoffman et al (2022)'s Chinchilla paper introduced the principle of
compute-optimal scaling, laying a foundation for future scaling of language
models. In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been
raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches,
and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for
the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work
demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model
parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three
interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different
interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps
surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not
meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the
compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation,
the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute
budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have
been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing
model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results
are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the
otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall,
Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our
findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide
for scaling language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着现代深度网络规模的增大，对自动检测数据集中标签错误的工具需求日益增长，因为标签噪声会损害神经网络训练的性能。

Method: 使用模型无关的事后方法，利用神经网络的倒数第二层特征。基于错误标签数据点的特征与其真实类别数据点的相似性高于其他类别的观察，通过紧密相似簇中标签出现概率来检测和修正错误。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在各种噪声下都表现出高性能，并能自动修正这些错误以提高数据集质量。

Conclusion: 基于倒数第二层特征相似性的方法能有效检测和修正数据集中的标签错误，提升数据集质量。

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融衍生品智能合约自动化能带来效率提升，但将金融规范转换为gas高效的可执行代码存在挑战，特别是从高级规范（如CDM）生成功能正确且经济可行的代码。

Method: 使用近端策略优化（PPO）强化学习代理，从预定义库中选择最优代码片段，采用两阶段课程学习：先训练功能正确性，再专注于gas优化。

Result: RL代理学会生成显著节省gas的合约，在未见测试数据上相比未优化基准实现高达35.59%的成本降低。

Conclusion: 该工作为自动合成可靠且经济可持续的智能合约提供了可行方法，弥合了高级金融协议与高效链上执行之间的差距。

Abstract: Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial
efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity
of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In
particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically
viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM),
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart
contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a
pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum
first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to
gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate
contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to
35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work
presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and
economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level
financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

TL;DR: GUIDE框架通过集成LLM生成的邻接矩阵和观测数据，解决了现有因果发现方法在可扩展性、计算效率和混合数据类型适应性方面的关键限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现方法（如PC、GES、ICA-LiNGAM）在节点可扩展性（超过70节点）、计算能耗和混合数据类型处理方面存在严重限制，需要更高效、适应性更强的解决方案。

Method: GUIDE采用双编码器架构，将LLM生成的邻接矩阵与观测数据集成，并通过强化学习代理动态平衡奖励最大化（准确性）和惩罚避免（DAG约束）。

Result: GUIDE相比RL-BIC和KCRL方法平均减少约42%的运行时间，相比NOTEARS和GraN-DAG平均提高约117%的准确率，并能扩展到≥70节点的场景。

Conclusion: GUIDE在计算效率、准确性和可扩展性方面显著优于现有方法，特别是在处理混合数据类型和大规模节点场景时表现出色。

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by
benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational
energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional
algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges,
exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability
beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large
Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data
through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational
efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and
KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy
over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's
reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization
(accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance
across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where
baseline methods fail.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了弱到强泛化中的关键问题：在存在虚假相关性的下游任务中，使用弱教师的伪标签微调强预训练学生模型时，弱到强泛化是否发生以及如何改进失败情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究弱到强泛化在存在群体不平衡导致的虚假相关性时的表现，特别是当标记数据和非标记数据的少数群体比例不同时，弱到强泛化可能失败的问题。

Method: 理论分析在比例渐近极限下的弱到强增益，并通过实验验证理论结果。提出一种简单有效的算法补救措施：在弱到强微调后，在强学生模型的高置信度数据子集上重新训练。

Result: 理论表明当非标记数据和标记数据的少数群体比例相同时，弱到强泛化总是发生；但当比例不同时，弱到强增益会随着比例差异的平方而减小。实验验证了理论结果，提出的算法在弱到强微调失败时能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化在群体不平衡场景下可能失败，但通过在高置信度数据子集上重新训练强学生模型，可以一致且显著地改进弱到强泛化性能，且该方法不需要群体标签。

Abstract: We initiate a unified theoretical and algorithmic study of a key problem in
weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization: when fine-tuning a strong pre-trained
student with pseudolabels from a weaker teacher on a downstream task with
spurious correlations, does W2S happen, and how to improve it upon failures? We
consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a
weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group
of fraction $\eta_\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set
pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\eta_u$.
Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional
asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels
when $\eta_u = \eta_\ell$ but may fail when $\eta_u \ne \eta_\ell$, where W2S
gain diminishes as $(\eta_u - \eta_\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is
corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation
benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures,
we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the
strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our
algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements
over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SLA（稀疏线性注意力）方法，通过将注意力权重分为关键、边缘和可忽略三类，分别应用O(N²)、O(N)计算和跳过处理，显著加速扩散模型的注意力计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在扩散变换器（DiT）模型中，特别是视频生成场景下，注意力延迟是主要瓶颈，因为序列长度长且注意力具有二次复杂度。

Method: SLA将注意力权重分为关键权重（高秩）、边缘权重（低秩）和可忽略权重，分别应用稀疏加速和低秩加速，并集成到单个GPU内核中支持前向和反向传播。

Result: SLA将注意力计算减少95%，在Wan2.1-1.3B模型上实现注意力计算13.7倍加速和端到端视频生成2.2倍加速，且不损失生成质量。

Conclusion: SLA通过融合稀疏和线性注意力，有效解决了DiT模型中的注意力计算瓶颈，在保持生成质量的同时实现了显著加速。

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

Motivation: 虽然已有大量研究关注拟合缩放定律和预测预训练损失及判别式评估的性能，但在生成式评估（如数学问题解决或软件工程）上的缩放定律研究相对较少。

Method: 提出并评估三种预训练缩放定律：(1) 基于计算量的缩放定律，(2) 基于模型参数和训练token的缩放定律，(3) 基于黄金参考解决方案对数似然的缩放定律。

Result: 发现计算量缩放定律和参数+token缩放定律在最后约1.5-2.5个数量级稳定，而黄金参考似然缩放定律在最后约5个数量级稳定；三种缩放定律预测性能相当，但计算量缩放定律在小k时预测稍差，黄金参考似然缩放定律在大k时预测稍差。

Conclusion: 建立了计算量缩放定律作为参数和token缩放定律的计算最优包络的理论联系，为研究人员和实践者提供了预测生成性能的见解和方法论。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have played a central role in modern machine learning,
driving the field's ever-expanding scaling of parameters, data and compute.
While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting
performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as
multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done
on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations
such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and
evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on
generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive
model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in
the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log
likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1)
We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting,
$k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the
predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find
that the compute scaling law and parameters\,+\,tokens scaling law stabilize
for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference
likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In
terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform
comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small
$k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse
for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute
scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the
parameters-and-tokens scaling law. Our framework provides researchers and
practitioners with insights and methodologies to forecast generative
performance.

TL;DR: GPS-MTM是一个用于大规模移动数据的轨迹基础模型，通过分解移动性为状态和动作两种模态，使用双向Transformer和掩码建模目标来学习丰富的语义关联，在轨迹填充和下一站预测等任务上表现优异。

Motivation: 基础模型在文本、视觉和视频理解方面取得了显著进展，现在有望在轨迹建模领域实现类似突破。现有方法将轨迹扁平化为坐标流，缺乏对移动性语义的理解。

Method: 将移动性分解为状态（兴趣点类别）和动作（代理转移）两种互补模态，使用双向Transformer和自监督掩码建模目标，重建跨模态的缺失片段，无需手动标签学习语义关联。

Result: 在Numosim-LA、Urban Anomalies和Geolife等基准数据集上，GPS-MTM在轨迹填充和下一站预测等下游任务中持续优于其他方法，在需要上下文推理的动态任务中优势最明显。

Conclusion: GPS-MTM成为轨迹分析的稳健基础模型，将移动数据定位为大规模表示学习的一流模态。

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further
reference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体强化学习方法主要关注风险规避设置，但在协作环境中这种保守性往往导致次优均衡。虽然乐观方法在实践中有效，但缺乏理论基础。

Method: 基于凸风险度量的对偶表示，提出了乐观价值函数框架，将乐观主义形式化为散度惩罚的风险寻求评估，并推导了相应的策略梯度定理和分散式算法。

Result: 在协作基准测试中，风险寻求的乐观方法相比风险中性基线和启发式乐观方法，持续改进了协调性能。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了风险敏感学习和乐观主义，为多智能体强化学习中的协作提供了理论基础和实际有效的方法。

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a
theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in
MARL.

Abstract: Device-cloud collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for deploying
large language models (LLMs), combining the efficiency of lightweight on-device
inference with the superior performance of powerful cloud LLMs. An essential
problem in this scenario lies in deciding whether a given query is best handled
locally or delegated to the cloud. Existing approaches typically rely on
external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to
determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing
decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled
through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization
problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem
solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we
develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level
policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the
reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on
cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that
the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and
significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

### [662] [On The Variability of Concept Activation Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24058)
*Julia Wenkmann,Damien Garreau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对概念激活向量(CAVs)的变异性进行了理论分析，发现其方差随随机样本数量N的增加以1/N的速度减小，并基于此提出了资源高效应用的建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAVs作为概念解释方法，其计算需要从训练集中随机采样，导致不同用户可能得到不同的向量结果。本文旨在量化这种随机性带来的变异性。

Method: 对CAVs构建过程进行细粒度的理论分析，并在多个真实数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 发现CAVs的方差随随机样本数量N的增加以1/N的速度减小，这是一个普遍性结果。

Conclusion: 基于方差分析结果，提出了资源高效应用CAVs方法的实用建议。

Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence is to make
models more transparent to their users. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A
promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level
concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of
methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one
of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their
computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the
actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness
of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis
of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results,
confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an
universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the
number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for
a resource-efficient application of the method.

TL;DR: 提出了ICQL框架，将Q学习重新定义为上下文推理问题，使用线性Transformer自适应地从检索到的转移中推断局部Q函数，无需显式子任务标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的离线强化学习方法通常依赖单一的全局Q函数，难以捕捉涉及多样化子任务的组合性质。

Method: 使用线性Transformer将Q学习建模为上下文推理问题，通过检索到的转移自适应推断局部Q函数，无需显式子任务标签。

Result: 在厨房任务中性能提升高达16.4%，在Gym和Adroit任务中分别提升8.6%和6.3%。

Conclusion: ICQL展示了上下文学习在鲁棒和组合价值估计中的潜力，为离线强化学习提供了一个原则性且有效的框架。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline
reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single
global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks
involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning
(\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a
contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer
local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels.
Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of
the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved
context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and
supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL}
substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance
in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\%
and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context
learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning
\texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

TL;DR: 将策略选择理论重新构建为基于神经网络的小型数学模型，扩展了原有理论并展示了与LLM架构的类比性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将经典的儿童算术学习理论（策略选择理论）与现代神经网络架构相结合，为数学推理能力在基于LLM的智能体中的涌现提供统一研究平台

Method: 采用神经网络架构构建小型数学模型，扩展了原有SCT模型，增加了计数练习、数字符号嵌入和门控注意力机制

Result: 模型成功展示了计数与加法之间的建设性和破坏性干扰，以及随着求和回忆能力提高而呈现的类似波浪状的手指计数使用模式

Conclusion: 该模型为研究SCT理论中更高级的方面（如自适应策略选择和策略发现）提供了基础，有助于探索数学推理能力在LLM智能体中的涌现机制

Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT)\footnote{``Strategy Choice Theory'',
``Distributions of Associations'', and ``Overlapping Wave Theory'' have been
used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different
aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth}
explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon
principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data,
probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like
importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast
SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based
architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting
practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the
supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated
attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and
destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like''
use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to
later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy
choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to
investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships
essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

*Youssef Sabiri,Walid Houmaidi,Ouail El Maadi,Yousra Chtouki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AQUAIR数据集填补了室内水产养殖环境数据空白，提供了摩洛哥水产养殖设施中6种室内环境质量变量的23,000多个时间戳观测数据，支持智能水产养殖研究和机器学习应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能水产养殖系统依赖环境数据流来保护鱼类福利、优化投喂和减少能耗，但描述室内养殖池周围空气的公共数据集稀缺，限制了结合空气条件与水质动态的预测和异常检测工具的开发。

Method: 使用Awair HOME监测器在摩洛哥水产养殖设施中每5分钟采样一次，记录空气温度、相对湿度、二氧化碳、总挥发性有机化合物、PM2.5和PM10等6个IEQ变量，采用ISO标准安装高度，经过校准检查和质量控制。

Result: 获得了超过23,000个时间戳观测数据，探索性统计显示稳定条件（中位CO2=758 ppm；PM2.5=12微克/立方米），有明显的投喂时间峰值，为短期预测、事件检测和传感器漂移研究提供了丰富结构。

Conclusion: AQUAIR填补了智能水产养殖信息学的关键空白，为数据中心的机器学习课程和环境传感研究提供了可复现的基准，特别关注循环水产养殖系统中的空气动态。

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space
dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

Motivation: 基于成对距离的成本在自监督和对比特征学习中至关重要，混合密度网络是生成模型和密度近似的常用方法。结合两者可以改进数据密度近似。

Method: 将混合密度网络与对比成本结合，使用四种核化矩阵成本：标量成本、向量-矩阵成本、矩阵-矩阵成本（Schur补的迹）和SVD成本（核范数）。

Result: 提出了一个结合混合密度网络和对比学习的框架，能够学习定义混合密度所需的多个中心。

Conclusion: 通过将混合密度网络与对比成本结合，使用核化矩阵成本方法，可以有效地进行数据密度近似和中心学习。

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive
feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach
for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to
produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with
contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four
types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the
matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the
nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture
density.

<details>

Motivation: 现有公平性方法要么需要牺牲模型准确率（基于均等的公平性），要么需要已知人口统计信息（基于偏好的公平性），这限制了在医疗等高风险领域的应用。

Method: 提出DAFH算法，联合学习群体分类器（将人口划分为多个群体）和与这些群体关联的解耦分类器，无需预先知道人口统计信息。

Result: 理论分析表明当人口统计信息已知时，该方法优于基线方法。在合成和真实数据上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DAFH算法能够在无需人口统计信息的情况下实现公平性，同时保持高准确率，为高风险领域的公平机器学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains
to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these
algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions
of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of
ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is
\textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or
outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness
often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many
high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of
research focuses on \textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group
of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer
the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various
sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic
information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we
relax this requirement and propose a novel \textit{demographic-agnostic
fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a
group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set
of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we
conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the
baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled
classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed
method.

TL;DR: PEARL是一个基于设备端LLM的D2D通信协作跨层优化框架，通过利用发布者和订阅者状态来指导Wi-Fi Aware参数选择，在合作低电量情况下可降低高达16%的能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展单设备设备端LLM的范式，利用对等设备感知的上下文信息来优化D2D通信性能，解决传统启发式和紧凑模型在跨层控制中的局限性。

Method: 提出PEARL框架，使用上下文感知奖励（根据应用容忍度归一化延迟，根据设备电池状态调制能耗）为KL微调提供更丰富的监督。研究两种轻量变体：PEARL（Head + LoRA）和PEARL-Lite（仅Head）。

Result: PEARL在基于真实测量的合成场景中，相比启发式和紧凑模型基线提高了目标分数，在合作低电量情况下能耗降低高达16%。PEARL-Lite在推理时间低于20毫秒的情况下达到接近相同的目标分数。

Conclusion: 对等感知上下文、奖励对齐训练和基于头部的效率使LLM在实际的始终在线、设备端跨层控制中变得实用。

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a
framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs,
PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states
to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which
normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device
battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study
two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves
the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms
inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios
grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic
and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative
low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context,
reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for
always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

TL;DR: 提出Clebsch-Gordan Transformer，通过新颖的Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，解决了等变transformer只能支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer的全局注意力机制计算成本高，而等变模型虽然在某些任务中精度更高但计算需求大。现有等变transformer只能支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口，限制了其表达能力和性能。

Method: 使用Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，支持所有阶的等变特征建模，达到O(N log N)的输入token复杂度，并利用Clebsch-Gordon矩阵的稀疏性实现高阶不可约特征的高效扩展。

Result: 在n体模拟、QM9、ModelNet点云分类和机器人抓取数据集等多个基准测试中，相比现有等变transformer在GPU内存大小、速度和准确性方面都表现出明显优势。

Conclusion: Clebsch-Gordan Transformer能够高效建模所有阶的等变特征，在保持等变性的同时实现了全局注意力的高效计算，在多个任务中超越了现有方法。

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

Motivation: 传统第一性原理方法计算缺陷能量和结构成本高昂，现有基于图神经网络的机器学习力场存在过度平滑和长程相互作用表示不足的问题，特别是在点缺陷建模中尤为突出。

Conclusion: ADAPT通过Transformer架构有效解决了GNN在点缺陷建模中的局限性，为加速缺陷结构弛豫提供了更高效的机器学习力场方案。

Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials.
First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and
structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However,
these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force
fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural
relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range
interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling
point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep
Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph
representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly
considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a
Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of
silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both
force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based
model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

Conclusion: GeoFunFlow为复杂几何上的逆问题提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，结合了几何感知编码和扩散建模的优势。

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
crucial in science and engineering. They are particularly challenging due to
ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries.
Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are computationally expensive,
especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based
approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for
regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\em
GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on
complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder
(GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE
employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and
produces continuous reconstructions of physical fields, while the diffusion
model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across five
benchmarks, GeoFunFlow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over
complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and
delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion model
baselines.

Motivation: EHR数据具有长序列、多变量、稀疏和缺失值等复杂性，传统深度学习方法面临挑战。Transformer模型计算复杂度高且上下文长度有限，而SSM模型主要关注序列级信息混合而非通道级数据。

Conclusion: HyMaTE作为可扩展和通用的解决方案，适用于现实世界的医疗保健应用。

Abstract: Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day
healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient
health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate
sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in
traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have
demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes,
their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder
their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space
Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time
sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but
focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level
data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and
Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model
tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs
with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on
multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an
effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data.
Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention
illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable
solution for real-world healthcare applications. Codes are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测模型在捕获长期时间依赖性和计算效率之间存在权衡，而传统回声状态网络(ESNs)虽然计算高效但表达能力有限。

Method: 使用扩展回声状态网络(X-ESNs)和MLP读出层，引入矩阵门控复合随机激活(MCRA)实现复杂的神经元特定时间动态，采用双流架构让近期输入历史动态选择无限时域记忆中的特征。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，EFNs相比PatchTST等方法实现了4倍训练速度提升和3倍模型大小减小，预测误差从43%降至35%，相对改进20%。EchoFormer在ETTh、ETTm、DMV、Weather和Air Quality数据集上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EFNs框架在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了长期时间序列预测的准确性和稳定性，为解决长期依赖问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge:
how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal
dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought
notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between
computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information
over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have
recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant
memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This
makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event
history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art
performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both
their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of
extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel
Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex,
neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's
representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In
addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history
dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon
memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to
4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like
PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative
improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently
achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh,
ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning
in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that
permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original
(``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness
property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval,
multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an
impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer
cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of
decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample
complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse
permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental
role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity
of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture.
The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input
with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation
learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative
mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate
``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when
these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of
intermediate computations).

Abstract: The problem of classification in machine learning has often been approached
in terms of function approximation. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach for classification in arbitrary compact metric spaces which, in
theory, yields both the number of classes, and a perfect classification using a
minimal number of queried labels. Our approach uses localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation
problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the
various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized
kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to
separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical
manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class
boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life
datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a
document dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于机器学习的台风轨迹和状态预测方法，使用梯度提升回归和随机森林等模型，在准确率和误差控制方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报模型计算量大且易受大气系统混沌特性影响，需要开发更高效准确的台风预测方法。

Method: 采用两阶段机器学习流程：首先用梯度提升回归模型预测台风特征（最大风速、最低气压等），然后将输出输入到随机森林、支持向量机和多层感知机分类器中预测台风状态。

Result: 随机森林分类器达到93%的准确率，在精度、召回率和F1分数上均优于其他模型，回归模型的气压和风速预测误差分别约为2.2mb和2.4kt。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型，特别是集成分类器，为传统预报方法提供了有效、可扩展的替代方案，具有实时台风预测和集成到决策支持系统的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life,
infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather
prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to
error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a
machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and
status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including
recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a
regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum
pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of
historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to
predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and
three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and
multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and
synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest
performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision,
recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying
minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results
yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about
2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models,
especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative
to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone
prediction and integration into decision support systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Bounded Parameter-Efficient Unlearning方法，通过在有界函数中应用MLP适配器来稳定LoRA微调，解决了梯度差异方法在语言模型遗忘中的不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法不稳定且不可靠，特别是梯度差异方法在结合交叉熵损失时会导致权重和梯度无界增长，造成训练不稳定并影响遗忘和保留效果。

Method: 提出参数高效的遗忘方法，在LoRA微调中应用有界函数到MLP适配器，控制上升过程中的权重动态，使梯度差异方法能够可靠收敛。

Result: 在TOFU、TDEC和MUSE基准测试中，从125M到8B参数的不同架构和规模上，该方法在遗忘方面取得显著改进，同时保持了保留能力。

Conclusion: 建立了一个理论上有基础、实践中可扩展的LLM遗忘框架，解决了现有方法的稳定性问题。

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy
and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A
widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent
on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data
whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy
loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading
to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide
a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how
ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP
layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient
Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based
fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple
modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient
difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE
benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our
method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving
retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable
framework for unlearning in LLMs.

*Qipeng Zhan,Zhuoping Zhou,Zexuan Wang,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出多尺度几何自编码器(MAE)，通过非对称架构同时保留数据的全局和局部几何结构，在编码器应用全局距离约束，在解码器应用局部几何约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自编码器方法通常分别关注全局或局部几何特性，全局方法存在距离近似误差累积问题，局部方法容易收敛到扭曲大尺度关系的次优解。

Method: 采用非对称架构设计，在编码器施加全局距离约束，在解码器施加局部几何约束，同时保留多尺度几何结构。

Result: 在合成流形和真实数据集上的综合实验表明，MAE在各种评估指标上持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 非对称设计自然符合编码器和解码器的不同角色，能够有效同时保留数据的全局和局部几何结构。

Abstract: Autoencoders have emerged as powerful models for visualization and
dimensionality reduction based on the fundamental assumption that
high-dimensional data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold. A critical
challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data
in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either
global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often
encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods
frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale
relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which
introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales
of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the
encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical
analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the
distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate
that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation
metrics.

*Ruibo Chen,Sheng Zhang,Yihan Wu,Tong Zheng,Peihua Mai,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Random Selection Probing (RSP)框架，通过统计假设检验检测模型相关性，为LLM和VLM提供原则性的模型关联检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型相似性检测方法需要访问模型参数或产生无原则阈值的启发式分数，限制了应用范围。需要可靠技术来确定模型是否从另一个模型微调而来。

Method: RSP在参考模型上优化文本或视觉前缀用于随机选择任务，评估其到目标模型的可迁移性，产生严格的p值量化相关性证据。引入无关基线模型过滤通用可迁移特征以减少误报。

Result: 在LLM和VLM上的实验表明，RSP对相关模型产生小p值，对无关模型保持高p值。消融研究证明了RSP的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RSP是第一个原则性的通用统计框架，用于模型相关性检测，在现代机器学习生态系统中实现透明和可解释的决策。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs) has heightened the need for reliable techniques to determine
whether a model has been fine-tuned from or is even identical to another.
Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or
produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their
applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a
hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a
statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model
for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target
model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To
mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to
filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and
VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models.
Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently
yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for
unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness
of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general
statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and
interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.

*Chuntian Chi,John Clapham,Leslie Cloud,Ingrid Pretzer-Aboff,GinaMari Blackwell,Huajie Shao,Gang Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FM-FoG是一个基于基础模型的实时可穿戴系统，无需患者特定训练即可检测帕金森患者的冻结步态，在未见过的患者上达到98.5%的F1分数，并显著延长设备电池寿命。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超过50%的中晚期帕金森患者受冻结步态影响，现有检测系统需要大量患者特定训练数据且缺乏泛化能力，限制了临床应用。

Method: 结合自监督预训练和传感器上下文集成，使用轻量级CNN-LSTM活动分类器仅在行走或站立时激活基础模型，避免不必要的计算。

Result: 在23名PD患者的VCU FoG-IMU数据集上，对未见患者达到98.5%的F1分数，显著优于基线方法，在智能手机上可延长电池寿命达72%，同时保持低于20ms的干预延迟。

Conclusion: FM-FoG能够实现实用、节能的医疗应用，无需个体化训练即可跨患者泛化。

Abstract: Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's
disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence
and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where
walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing
or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection
systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack
generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we
introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving
FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our
approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only
during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier
selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing,
avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23
PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen
patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on
a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72%
while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our
FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that
generalize across patients without individual training requirements.

*Linghao Kong,Angelina Ning,Micah Adler,Nir Shavit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文发现语言模型中存在一类稀疏的Wasserstein神经元，这些神经元在负预激活空间中通过区分相似输入来支持语法功能，其针对性移除会显著破坏模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中特定类型神经元的功能角色，特别是那些在区分相似输入中起关键作用的神经元，以理解模型如何实现语法处理。

Method: 通过分析Wasserstein神经元的负预激活行为，设计符号特异性干预实验（仅将负预激活置零），并与随机和困惑度匹配的对照组进行比较。

Result: 针对Wasserstein神经元负预激活的干预显著削弱模型整体功能并破坏语法行为，而对照组影响很小；词性分析显示语法支架标记的意外性增加。

Conclusion: 负预激活空间中稀疏的纠缠神经元分化是语言模型依赖的关键语法机制，这些神经元在训练过程中出现并稳定，对语法处理至关重要。

Abstract: A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein
neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite
constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal
collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating
similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding
smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative
pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are
driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic
tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region
is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal,
sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a
small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function
and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched
controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech
analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and
layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate
across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical
behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results
identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a
crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.

Motivation: 受实际应用约束、LLM-RL基础设施复杂性以及RL方法创新的驱动，研究大语言模型的离策略强化学习。传统REINFORCE及其变体通常被视为策略上算法，对离策略性容忍度有限。

Result: 分析澄清了GRPO中重要性采样和裁剪的作用，统一并重新解释了OPMD和AsymRE算法作为REINFORCE损失的正则化形式，为启发式数据加权策略提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 研究结果为离策略RL提供了可操作的见解，并通过实证研究验证，为LLM的离策略RL开辟了新的原则性算法设计机会。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抑郁症诊断主要依赖主观评估，缺乏多模态临床信息整合能力，大语言模型虽能提高诊断准确性但面临可解释性差、幻觉问题和依赖合成数据等挑战。

Method: 开发MDD-Thinker框架，整合监督微调和强化学习来增强推理能力和可解释性，使用UK Biobank数据集生成40,000个推理样本，并补充10,000个公开心理健康数据集样本进行微调。

Result: MDD-Thinker达到0.8268准确率和0.8081 F1分数，显著优于SVM、MLP等传统方法和通用大语言模型，结合SFT和RL带来29.0%准确率、38.1% F1分数和34.8% AUC的相对提升。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于大规模真实世界临床数据的推理增强大语言模型抑郁症诊断框架，通过整合SFT和RL平衡了准确性、可解释性和效率，为智能精神病诊断提供了可扩展方法。

Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global
disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective
assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information.
Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy
through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability,
hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank
dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000
samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was
fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning
performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and
state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081,
significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well
as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest
improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and
34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance
compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework
for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By
integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric
diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide
clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader
applications in mental health care.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Conda优化器，通过列归一化结合Adam的坐标自适应性和全局谱归一化，在LLM预训练中实现2-2.5倍于AdamW的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adam优化器虽然收敛快，但存在谱条件差和低秩结构问题；Muon通过全局谱归一化解决此问题但缺乏坐标自适应。需要结合两者优势。

Method: Conda将更新投影到正交子空间，基于投影梯度应用列级二阶矩归一化，既改善谱条件又保持坐标自适应。

Result: 在LLaMA和GPT-2系列上，Conda始终优于AdamW、Muon等基线，在LLaMA系列上达到AdamW 2-2.5倍的收敛速度。

Conclusion: Conda是用于大规模LLM训练的有效且广泛适用的优化器。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and
emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive
and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast
convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal
that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank
structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral
normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges
the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal
subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the
projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and
maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral
pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive
experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently
outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on
the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence
speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further
ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These
results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable
optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on

Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法往往会扭曲细节或引入伪影，需要一种能保持视觉相似性同时实现语义编辑的方法

Method: 使用耦合SDEs，通过相同的相关噪声驱动源图像和编辑图像，引导采样过程

Result: 方法无需重新训练或辅助网络，实现了高提示保真度和接近像素级的视觉一致性

Conclusion: 耦合SDEs是控制生成AI的简单而强大的工具

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) is critical for industrial
competitiveness, yet its adoption is frequently stalled by the prohibitive
costs and operational disruptions of upgrading legacy systems. The financial
and logistical overhead required to support the full ML lifecycle presents a
formidable barrier to widespread implementation, particularly for small and
medium-sized enterprises. This paper introduces a pragmatic, API-based
framework designed to overcome these challenges by strategically decoupling the
ML model lifecycle from the production environment. Our solution delivers the
analytical power of ML to domain experts through a lightweight, browser-based
interface, eliminating the need for local hardware upgrades and ensuring model
maintenance can occur with zero production downtime. This human-in-the-loop
approach empowers experts with interactive control over model parameters,
fostering trust and facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
By mitigating the primary financial and operational risks, this framework
offers a scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and
safety, thereby strengthening the competitive advantage of the manufacturing
sector.

Conclusion: 该基准框架为未来PU学习算法的评估提供了标准化、公平的比较环境，促进了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is a weakly supervised binary classification
problem, in which the goal is to learn a binary classifier from only positive
and unlabeled data, without access to negative data. In recent years, many PU
learning algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However,
experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to identify
which algorithm performs better. In this paper, we propose the first PU
learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our
implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the
realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many
PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for
model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where
no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically
investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the
problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e.,
the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols
are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant
difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of
unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet
effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across
families. We hope our framework will provide an accessible, realistic, and fair
environment for evaluating PU learning algorithms in the future.

However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning
skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling
at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address
this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the
strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic
reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension,
and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a
competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different
play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard.
The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic
understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different
modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal
significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess
engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random
player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the
testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance,
approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了图基础模型(GFM)，这是第一个能够解决图结构上所有基于距离的优化问题的框架，通过自监督预训练学习图的拓扑结构，然后用简单生成式启发式方法解决各种优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将预训练-迁移范式扩展到图结构上的运筹学问题面临挑战，因为语言的统计灵活性与图的严格组合约束之间存在根本冲突。

Method: 引入LLM式的自监督预训练范式，在图中的随机游走路径上进行训练，使GFM内化图的复杂拓扑和组合规则，将结构连通性本身作为监督信号。

Result: 在20到893个节点的网络上进行综合实验，GFM在各种不同优化任务类别中与专业求解器相比具有竞争力，同时保持显著更快的推理时间。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了将预训练-迁移框架适应图优化的新范式，为将基础模型创新应用于运筹学打开了大门。

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language
models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models
that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending
this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains
challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility
of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this
gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable
of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By
introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths
generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the
graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of
the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing
neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our
approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's
intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to
tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive
experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM
achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety
of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster
inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the
pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for
applying foundation model innovations to OR.

*Inkyu Park,Jeong-Gwan Lee,Taehwan Kwon,Juheon Choi,Seungku Kim,Junsu Kim,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个模拟框架来建模ESP作弊者、非作弊者和基于轨迹的检测器，通过对抗游戏研究作弊者与检测器的共同演化，模拟作弊者动态切换作弊行为以平衡奖励优化和检测规避。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESP作弊难以检测，因为其效果无法直接从玩家行为中观察到，且缺乏可靠标记数据。作弊者还会调整行为来限制或伪装作弊，进一步增加了检测难度。

Method: 将作弊者和非作弊者建模为具有不同可观察性的强化学习智能体，检测器对其行为轨迹进行分类。将作弊者与检测器的交互建模为对抗游戏，引入结构化作弊者模型动态切换作弊行为。

Result: 实验表明该框架成功模拟了自适应作弊行为，能够策略性地平衡奖励优化和检测规避。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究自适应作弊行为和开发有效作弊检测器提供了一个可控且可扩展的平台。

Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game
information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their
effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable
evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is
essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters
often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which
further complicates detection and detector development. To address these
challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP
cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and
non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of
observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we
formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an
adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect
realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that
dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on
detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully
simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward
optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and
extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing
effective cheat detectors.

<details>

Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型难以将语言指令作为先验约束整合到EEG表征学习中，限制了利用语言语义知识统一不同标签和任务的能力。

Method: 提出联合谱时重构模块进行预训练，结合频率掩码和两种时间目标；在指令调优阶段使用指令条件Q-Former，通过可学习查询将指令嵌入注入EEG标记并与文本标签嵌入对齐。

Conclusion: 分析首次揭示了显式任务指令作为语义先验，引导EEG嵌入到连贯且语言基础的空间中，增强了解码鲁棒性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which
capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the
development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches
still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for
EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic
knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address
this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language
Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates
task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned
EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In
the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction
(STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral
perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to
capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential
dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the
Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention
transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them
with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on
20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual
evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best
average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses
reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic
priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.
The code and pre-trained weights will be released.

Result: 在理论保证和实验性能上都显著优于现有方法，Rennala NIGT在均匀设置下提供更好的计算和通信复杂度，Malenia NIGT在异构环境下提供更优的理论保证。

Conclusion: 提出的两种算法成功解决了分布式强化学习中的异步计算和通信挑战，为异构环境下的策略梯度方法提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study distributed reinforcement learning (RL) with policy gradient methods
under asynchronous and parallel computations and communications. While
non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved
remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less
explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous
computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms,
Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient
aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous
setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and
communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the
heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous
computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical
guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that
our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤有机碳是土壤健康和全球气候韧性的基础，但由于复杂的物理、化学和生物过程，其预测仍然困难。

Method: 使用通用微分方程框架，将机械物理（如平流扩散传输）与学习非线性微生物生产和呼吸的神经网络相结合，通过合成数据集系统评估了六个实验案例。

Result: 在无噪声和中等噪声（7%）条件下表现优异（MSE=1.6e-5，R2=0.9999），但在高噪声（35%）条件下出现过拟合（R2=0.94）或过度平滑的问题（负R2）。

Conclusion: 通用微分方程适用于可扩展、噪声容忍的土壤有机碳预测，但需要噪声感知损失函数、概率建模和更紧密的微生物动态整合才能实现野外部署。

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate
resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical,
chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific
Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations
(UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend
mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural
networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using
synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases,
progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%)
multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the
potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise
settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal
profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5,
and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 =
0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic
measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear
evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy
but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise
at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture
depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of
standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs
are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing
toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic
modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出SALT方法，使用固定教师模型替代EMA更新，通过两阶段训练（像素重建和掩码潜在预测）实现更高效、可扩展的视频表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V-JEPA使用EMA更新教师模型防止表示崩溃，但增加了模型选择的复杂性并耦合了师生架构。本文重新审视掩码潜在预测，探索固定教师模型的可行性。

Method: 两阶段训练：1) 使用像素重建目标训练教师编码器；2) 冻结教师，训练学生模型预测教师掩码区域的潜在表示。

Result: SALT在多个基准测试中优于V-JEPA 2编码器，计算效率更高，在相同FLOPs下获得更高准确率，且学生质量对教师质量具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SALT是EMA自蒸馏的简单、可扩展且计算高效的替代方案，建议将计算预算主要分配给学生模型。

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

TL;DR: 提出了AuON优化器，通过非线性缩放和归一化实现线性时间复杂度的半正交动量更新，避免了传统正交化方法的高计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交梯度更新方法计算成本高（O(n^3)），且动量只能在严格正交化后应用，性能不如调优后的SGD。现有方法如Muon虽然将复杂度降至O(n^2)，但二次成本仍是瓶颈

Method: 研究动量更新的半正交特性，在谱范数信任区域内约束动量更新，结合双曲余弦RMS缩放变换和归一化，避免显式构建半正交矩阵。还提出混合版本Hybrid-AuON，应用单次Newton-Schulz迭代

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，AuON及其混合变体实现了与AdamW和Muon等强基线相当的性能

Conclusion: AuON提供了一种计算高效的替代方案，能在保持结构对齐和重新调节病态更新的同时，实现线性时间复杂度，相比Newton-Schulz方法更具效率和效果

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in
optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as
SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and
underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is
applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon,
improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing
semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to
O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based
updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm
trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit
semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized
nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance
without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural
alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines
hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating
both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz
methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a
single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language
benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable
to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法依赖干净数据来防御拜占庭攻击，但在实际应用中干净数据往往不可得，因此需要开发不依赖干净数据的鲁棒聚合方法。

Method: H+从客户端上传的p维参数向量中随机选择r维片段，使用相似性检查函数H与参考向量比较，保留最相似的客户端向量进行聚合。参考向量可从现有鲁棒算法或无干净数据时直接使用干净数据获得。

Result: 综合实验验证H+在多种拜占庭攻击比例和类型下均表现出色，在所有评估场景和基准数据集上都显著优于现有方法，成为最先进的防御方法。

Conclusion: H+不仅在有干净数据时优于现有方法，还扩展了联邦学习在无干净数据场景下的应用，同时保持较低的计算复杂度，为拜占庭攻击防御提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can
compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server.
Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate
such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on
similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data,
i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt
this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to
settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel
similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing
methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL
systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects
$r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to
the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment
against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for
aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust
algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data.
Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest
clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an
analytical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of
clients and $Kr \ll p$. Comprehensive experiments validate H+ as a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness
improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and
multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios
and benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to
forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science
and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system
parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen
out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is
of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on
discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics
trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains
deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are
still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE
dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we
first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out
that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant
across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this
two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method
termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert
architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive
experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate
iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization
capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

Conclusion: 该框架使决策者能够根据各种场景和玩家、设计师的多样化需求做出明智选择

Abstract: In recent years, the generation of diverse game levels has gained increasing
interest, contributing to a richer and more engaging gaming experience. A
number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are
naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both
relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation
approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those
dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by
considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We
formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each
diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a
multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple
diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is
proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros.
demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional
diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a
range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics,
including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability
enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators
accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and
designers.

Motivation: 扩散语言模型能够以任意顺序生成token，而传统自回归语言模型水印方法依赖于先前生成的token，这在DLM中并不总是可用。

Result: 实验评估显示DLM水印实现了>99%的真阳性率，质量影响最小，且与现有ARLM水印具有相似的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 首次实现了可靠的扩散语言模型水印，为这一新兴LLM范式提供了有效的版权保护方案。

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models
(DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in
contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate
tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key
challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is
that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available
with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying
the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are
yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark
strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while
keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with
minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM
watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

TL;DR: 本文首次成功将进化策略（ES）扩展到大规模语言模型（LLM）的完整参数微调，证明ES在数十亿参数规模下仍能高效搜索，并在多个方面优于现有的强化学习（RL）微调方法。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管进化策略（ES）曾在百万参数级模型上表现出与强化学习（RL）相当的性能，但由于被认为难以扩展到更大模型而被忽视。本文旨在挑战这一观点，探索ES在大规模LLM微调中的潜力。

Method: 采用进化策略（ES）方法对预训练LLM的完整参数进行微调，突破了传统认为ES难以扩展到数十亿参数规模的技术障碍。

Result: ES在数十亿参数规模的LLM微调中表现出色：比RL方法更样本高效、对长程奖励更容忍、对不同基础LLM更鲁棒、更少出现奖励黑客行为、在不同运行中性能更稳定。

Conclusion: 进化策略为LLM微调开辟了超越当前RL技术的新方向，证明ES在大规模参数优化中具有显著优势，可作为RL方法的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is
a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of
many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once
showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters,
was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger
models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for
fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES
can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL
fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency,
tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less
tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It
therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond
what current RL techniques provide. The source codes are provided at:

Method: AXIS框架不直接序列化时间序列，而是为LLM提供三种提示：符号数值提示用于数值基础，上下文集成提示从预训练编码器提取细粒度动态，任务先验提示编码全局异常特征。

Result: 实验表明AXIS能生成更高质量的解释，并在检测准确性上与通用LLM、专用时间序列LLM和时间序列视觉语言模型相竞争。

Conclusion: AXIS通过多提示条件化方法有效解决了时间序列异常检测的解释性问题，在解释质量和检测性能方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that
articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits
and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series
as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental
challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process
long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization
suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment
between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework
that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of
direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary
hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical
grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a
pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a
task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to
facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark
featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual
grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both
LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of
significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy
compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series
Vision Language Models.

*Sushant Mehta,Raj Dandekar,Rajat Dandekar,Sreedath Panat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练小型到中型transformer解码器（30M-200M参数）时，相比AdamW节省48-52%训练计算量，同时保持或改善最终困惑度。与MLA和MoE结合时，能实现68%内存减少和3.2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Muon优化器在训练transformer时的理论基础和实际性能，特别是在与现代化架构优化技术协同作用时的表现。

Method: 提供严格的理论分析包括收敛率、谱正则化特性、与Stiefel流形上自然梯度下降的联系，以及谱范数下的最速梯度下降等价性。结合Multi-Head Latent Attention和Mixture-of-Experts进行实证研究。

Result: Muon在保持数据效率的同时扩展了计算-时间权衡的Pareto前沿。实证显示用48-52%的训练计算达到目标损失，MLA+MoE+Muon组合实现68%内存减少和3.2倍推理加速，困惑度改善8-12%。

Conclusion: Muon是AdamW的一个有理论基础、稳健的替代方案，特别在与现代效率技术和大批量训练机制结合时表现优异。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study of the Muon
optimizer for training transformers only with a small to medium decoder (30M -
200M parameters), with an emphasis on its mathematical foundations, convergence
properties and synergistic interactions with modern architectural
optimizations. Building on recent work showing Muon's scalability, we provide
rigorous theoretical analysis including: (i)showing the convergence rate under
standard assumptions, (ii) spectral regularization properties that prevent
gradient explosion, (iii) connection to natural gradient descent on the Stiefel
manifold, and (iv) equivalence to steepest gradient descent under the spectral
norm. Crucially, we demonstrate that Muon expands the Pareto frontier in the
compute-time trade-off by maintaining superior data efficiency at large batch
sizes, a key finding of~\cite{essentialai2025muon} that we validate across our
model scales. Empirically, Muon reaches the target loss with 48-52\% of the
training calculated by AdamW while maintaining or improving the final
perplexity, consistent with larger-scale results. When combined with Multi-Head
Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), we observe multiplicative
efficiency gains: MLA+MoE+Muon achieves 68\% memory reduction and 3.2$\times$
inference speedup, while improving perplexity by 8-12\%. We provide detailed
procedures on 15 architectural and optimizer components, stability analyzes
across 100+ training runs, and practical implementation guidelines including
Newton-Schulz coefficients $(3.4445, -4.7750, 2.0315)$ optimized
by~\cite{su2024muonblog}. Our theoretical analysis and comprehensive
experiments establish Muon as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that
particularly excels when combined with modern efficiency techniques and
large-batch training regimes.

TL;DR: 提出ScatterAD方法，利用高维空间中样本分散现象作为归纳信号，通过建模时间和拓扑维度的表示分散来增强多元时间序列异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法独立建模空间或时间依赖关系，导致表示学习不优且对高维空间中异常分散的敏感性有限。实证分析显示正常和异常样本在高维空间中都会分散，尤其是异常样本分散更明显。

Method: 提出ScatterAD方法，包含拓扑编码器捕获图结构分散，时间编码器通过最小化相邻时间步的均方误差来约束过度分散。引入对比融合机制确保时间和拓扑表示的互补性，并通过最大化条件互信息提高跨视图一致性和表示判别性。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ScatterAD在多元时间序列异常检测上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 利用表示分散作为归纳信号能有效增强时空异常检测，ScatterAD方法通过建模时间和拓扑维度的分散现象，实现了优异的异常检测性能。

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies
in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However,
traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal
dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and
limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this
work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous
samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples
are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as
scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample
representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance
spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model
representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD
incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering
and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared
error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive
fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and
topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that
maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological
views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that
ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series
anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository:

TL;DR: BiHDTrans是一种高效的神经符号二元超维Transformer，将自注意力机制集成到HD计算范式中，结合了HD计算的高效表示能力和Transformer的时间建模能力，在资源受限的边缘环境中实现准确、可扩展和低延迟的多变量时间序列分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备产生的多变量时间序列数据量激增，需要在资源受限的边缘环境中进行高效准确处理。HD计算虽然高效但难以捕捉复杂时间模式，而Transformer虽然擅长序列建模但计算和内存开销大。

Method: 提出BiHDTrans模型，将自注意力机制集成到HD计算范式中，在超维空间中进行二值化，利用高维表示的独立同分布特性实现硬件加速。

Result: BiHDTrans比最先进的HD计算模型准确率至少提高14.47%，比最先进的二元Transformer平均准确率高6.67%。在FPGA上实现39.4倍的低延迟推理，即使减少64%的超空间维度仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: BiHDTrans成功弥合了Transformer的表达能力和HD计算效率之间的差距，为资源受限环境中的多变量时间序列分类提供了准确、可扩展和低延迟的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an
unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring
efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in
resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with
its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in
classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while
Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory
overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary
hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD
computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing
with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and
achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With
hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the
independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional
representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary
Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic
high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than
directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy.
Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains
competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing
SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as
well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional
baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the
expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling
accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于模态对齐的多模态嵌入语义压缩方法，通过减少模态间差距，用语义概念的质心替代多个嵌入，实现显著的内存节省而不损失性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态表示学习产生高维嵌入，虽然能实现强泛化能力，但也带来了存储和下游处理的可扩展性挑战。关键问题是如何在减少多模态嵌入内存占用的同时，保持其跨模态表示共享语义内容的能力。

Method: 提出基于模态对齐的语义压缩方法，当模态间差距充分减小时，不同模态但表达相同语义的嵌入共享空间中的共同部分，因此它们的质心可以忠实表示该语义概念，从而用单个质心替代多个嵌入。

Result: 在多样化大规模多模态下游任务中验证了方法的有效性，实现了显著压缩而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 模态对齐是实现语义压缩的关键推动因素，所提出的方法在保持性能的同时实现了显著的内存节省。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that
align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong
generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of
storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve
semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings
while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across
modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the
modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different
modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the
gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but
expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore,
their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This
enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding
significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic
compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained
encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale
multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a
key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach
achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型训练内存需求大、推理模型尺寸大的问题，通过进化框架实现高效训练和小型化部署。

Method: 将LLM划分为结构相同但参数不同的专家子网络，每次只训练一个专家，在AdamW优化后应用交叉、PSO和变异等进化算子，让当前专家学习最佳专家的经验。

Result: 最佳专家能达到与完整模型几乎相同的准确率，训练内存需求大幅降低，吞吐量提升10倍以上，模型推理尺寸显著减小。

Conclusion: 该进化框架能有效减少LLM训练内存需求，提高训练效率，同时保持模型性能，适合在PC和边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large
language models(LLM). The models are divided into several
experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter
values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW
optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on
the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current
expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert
would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight
of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the
same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the
model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the
training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments
show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code
is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy
deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了联邦学习中数据分布扰动和异常值影响的问题，通过不平衡Wasserstein距离和KL惩罚机制实现了对异常值的鲁棒性，为分布鲁棒联邦学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct
data sharing, but its performance can degrade significantly in the presence of
data distribution perturbations. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
provides a principled framework for handling this by optimizing performance
against the worst-case distributions within a prescribed ambiguity set.
However, existing DRO-based FL methods often overlook the detrimental impact of
outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias the learned
models. In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with
explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the
unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric
distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler
penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally
leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable
decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian
penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this
reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated
learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 核方法虽然理论基础扎实，但在可扩展性方面长期受限，特别是在表示学习领域缺乏可扩展框架，限制了其在需要从海量无标签数据学习表示的基础模型时代的应用。

Method: 通过Nyström近似构建统一的核表示学习框架KREPES，支持多种无监督和自监督损失函数。

Result: 在大型图像和表格数据集上的实验证明了KREPES的高效性，能够实现可扩展的核表示学习。

Conclusion: KREPES不仅解决了核表示学习的可扩展性问题，还提供了比深度模型更具原则性的可解释性，这是其重要优势。

Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and
non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical
guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time
and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no
framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting
their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned
from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable
framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation.
KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses,
and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency.
Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned
representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate
through dedicated analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了FS-KAN（函数共享KAN），一种构建任意排列对称群的等变和不变KA层的原则性方法，统一并显著扩展了该领域先前的工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然等变KAN在特定数据类型中已得到探索，但在一般背景下对具有排列对称性的数据应用的原则性框架仍然缺失。

Method: 通过将参数共享方案推广到Kolmogorov-Arnold设置，推导FS-KAN层的基本构造，并提供理论分析证明FS-KAN具有与标准参数共享层相同的表达能力。

Result: 在多数据类型和对称群上的实证评估显示，FS-KAN在某些情况下比标准参数共享层表现出显著优越的数据效率，同时保持KAN的可解释性和适应性。

Conclusion: FS-KAN在低数据场景下是一个优秀的架构选择，因为它结合了数据效率、可解释性和适应性。

Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks employing parameter-sharing schemes
have emerged as powerful models for leveraging a wide range of data symmetries,
significantly enhancing the generalization and computational efficiency of the
resulting models. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated
promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to
traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been
explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled
framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general
context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a
principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for
arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending
previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN
layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup
and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same
expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers,
allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from
parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data
types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency
compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain
cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making
them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.

Motivation: 解决持续学习中提示方法的权衡问题：任务特定提示方法计算开销大且内存需求随任务数量线性增长，而共享提示方法效率高但存在知识干扰导致性能下降。

Method: 基于前缀调优与混合专家的关系，将共享提示组织为多个提示专家，使用提示注意力分数聚合机制动态选择相关专家，引入自适应噪声机制平衡专家利用，设计基于原型的损失函数增强专家专业化。

Conclusion: SMoPE成功平衡了效率与性能的权衡，为持续学习中的提示方法提供了更优的解决方案，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低了计算和内存需求。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning
(CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent
strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task,
which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes
memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely,
approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater
efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge
interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework
that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt
strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix
Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into
multiple "prompt experts" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input,
only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating
interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention
score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each
expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an
adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while
preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert
specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix
keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple
CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific
prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art
approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational
costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的分布偏移下的不确定性量化仍然是深度学习模型部署的主要障碍。现有的事后方法要么继承错误置信度，要么仅重塑预测，而没有教会模型何时应该不确定。

Method: GUIDE通过校准阶段识别显著内部特征，然后使用这些特征构建噪声驱动的课程，教会模型如何以及何时表达不确定性。该方法无需重新训练、无需架构修改、无需手动中间层选择。

Result: GUIDE避免了从基础模型中蒸馏过度自信，将分布外检测提高了约77%，对抗攻击检测提高了约80%，同时保持了分布内性能。在各种基准测试中始终优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: GUIDE证明了需要主动引导不确定性，以缩小预测置信度与可靠性之间的差距。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a major obstacle to the
deployment of deep learning models under distributional shift. Existing
post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced
confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be
uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model
approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns
how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a
calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven
curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE
requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual
intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring
broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids
distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution
detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving
in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively
guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and
reliability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了LLM DNA的概念，作为大语言模型功能行为的低维表示，用于追踪模型间的进化关系，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型数量爆炸式增长，但模型间的进化关系（如微调、蒸馏、适应）往往缺乏文档记录或难以追踪，这给LLM管理带来了挑战。现有方法受限于任务特定性、固定模型集或对分词器和架构的严格假设。

Method: 受生物DNA启发，数学定义LLM DNA为功能行为的低维双Lipschitz表示，证明其满足遗传和遗传决定论性质，并建立了DNA的存在性。基于此理论，推导出一个通用、可扩展、无需训练的DNA提取流程。

Result: 在305个LLM上的实验表明，DNA与先前有限子集研究一致，在特定任务上表现优异或具有竞争力。DNA比较揭示了LLM之间先前未记录的关联，构建的进化树显示了从编码器-解码器到仅解码器架构的转变，反映了时间进展，并揭示了不同LLM家族的进化速度差异。

Conclusion: LLM DNA为理解和管理大语言模型的进化关系提供了理论基础和实用工具，能够有效追踪模型间的遗传关系并构建进化树。

Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but
opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary
relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often
undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are
limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about
tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these
limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional,
bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA
satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the
existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable,
training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA
aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or
competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons
uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct
the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with
shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal
progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

TL;DR: 本文提出测试时训练(TTT)有效的原因是基础模型在全局上仍然欠参数化，TTT提供了在泛化后进行专门化的机制，将容量集中在测试任务相关的概念上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对测试时训练为何有效缺乏深入理解，传统解释主要关注分布外适应或特权数据，但基础模型时代大部分测试数据都是分布内数据，这些解释不再适用。

Method: 在线性表示假设下建立理论模型，通过稀疏自编码器在ImageNet上的实验验证关键假设，并在图像和语言任务上进行扩展研究。

Result: 理论模型显示TTT能获得比全局训练更小的分布内测试误差，实验证实语义相关数据点仅由少量共享概念解释，扩展研究确定了专门化最有效的机制。

Conclusion: 基础模型在全局上仍然欠参数化，测试时训练通过专门化机制能有效提升性能，特别是在将模型容量集中在测试任务相关概念时效果最显著。

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a
model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and
have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is
limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations
mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to
out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the
growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution
questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain
globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization
after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task.
Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in
which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than
global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by
training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related
data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform
scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical
implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most
effective.

TL;DR: 本文探讨如何通过物理归纳偏置在模型效能和效率之间取得平衡，证明物理知识嵌入能显著提升效率并保持或改善效能，同时降低碳足迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习主要关注模型效能提升，导致大规模模型资源消耗巨大、碳足迹显著。需要探索效能与效率之间的平衡。

Method: 研究时空预测任务中的物理归纳偏置，包括标准物理信息模型和更新的流匹配模型，通过嵌入物理知识来优化模型设计。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入物理归纳偏置能在保持或提升效能的同时，显著提高计算、能源和碳效率。

Conclusion: 模型效率应与模型效能同等重要，成为机器学习模型开发和部署的核心考量因素。

Abstract: Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the
push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on
efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive
resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model
life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer
useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy,
and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a
task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels
of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into
the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even
improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using
standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness
of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for
spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics
inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce
the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model
efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration
driving machine learning model development and deployment.

TL;DR: LEAF是一个用于少样本持续事件检测的专家混合框架，通过LoRA参数化专家、语义感知专家选择、对比学习和知识蒸馏来解决数据有限和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在少样本持续学习场景中存在严重遗忘问题，主要由于共享基础模型的完全微调导致任务间知识干扰，以及数据增强策略可能引入不自然或语义失真的输入。

Method: 提出LEAF框架：1) 在基础模型中集成专家混合架构，每个专家使用LoRA矩阵参数化；2) 语义感知专家选择机制动态路由实例到最相关专家；3) 基于标签描述的对比学习目标；4) 知识蒸馏策略防止内存缓冲区过拟合。

Result: 在多个FCED基准测试上的广泛实验表明，LEAF始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LEAF通过专家专业化、语义引导对比学习和知识蒸馏，有效解决了少样本持续事件检测中的知识干扰和遗忘问题。

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的多模态引导机制MDG，利用模态嵌入的向量空间来增强视频到音频生成中的跨模态对齐，可即插即用到任何预训练音频扩散模型上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法要么需要在大规模配对数据集上进行昂贵的联合训练，要么依赖可能无法捕捉全局多模态一致性的成对相似性。

Method: 提出多模态扩散引导(MDG)，利用视频、音频和文本模态嵌入的向量空间来强制执行统一的对齐，作为轻量级的即插即用控制信号。

Result: 在VGGSound和AudioCaps数据集上的实验表明，MDG相比基线方法持续提升了感知质量和多模态对齐效果。

Conclusion: 多模态联合引导对于视频到音频生成是有效的，MDG提供了一种无需重新训练的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned audio from silent videos, with potential applications in video editing,
Foley sound design, and assistive multimedia. Although the excellent results,
existing approaches either require costly joint training on large-scale paired
datasets or rely on pairwise similarities that may fail to capture global
multimodal coherence. In this work, we propose a novel training-free multimodal
guidance mechanism for V2A diffusion that leverages the volume spanned by the
modality embeddings to enforce unified alignment across video, audio, and text.
The proposed multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG) provides a lightweight,
plug-and-play control signal that can be applied on top of any pretrained audio
diffusion model without retraining. Experiments on VGGSound and AudioCaps
demonstrate that our MDG consistently improves perceptual quality and
multimodal alignment compared to baselines, proving the effectiveness of a
joint multimodal guidance for V2A.

TL;DR: SWAX是一种结合滑动窗口注意力机制和xLSTM线性RNN层的混合架构，研究发现较小的滑动窗口反而能提升长上下文性能，通过随机改变窗口大小训练模型，在短上下文和长上下文任务上都表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明混合架构优于单独的注意力机制或RNN，但窗口长度的影响以及注意力与RNN层之间的相互作用研究不足。

Method: 提出SWAX架构，结合滑动窗口注意力和xLSTM线性RNN层，采用随机改变滑动窗口大小的训练策略。

Result: 发现较大的滑动窗口不会改善长上下文性能，短窗口注意力能更好地训练xLSTM的长期记忆；随机窗口训练显著优于常规窗口注意力。

Conclusion: SWAX通过随机窗口训练策略，在短上下文和长上下文任务上都取得了显著性能提升，证明了混合架构的有效性。

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax
attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform
both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window
length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain
under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture
consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not
improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention
encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by
relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for
short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately
larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically
changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer
context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes
significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and
long-context problems.

TL;DR: 实验展示了深度强化学习在高雷诺数(Re=3000)下对圆柱体涡激振动进行主动流动控制，通过旋转驱动实现了80%到95%的振动抑制效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突破以往低雷诺数数值模拟的限制，在具有挑战性的实验环境中实现实时控制，解决执行器延迟等实际约束问题。

Method: 使用深度强化学习算法，提供状态反馈(位移和速度)，通过旋转驱动控制涡激振动，并通过增加历史控制动作来缓解延迟问题。

Result: 仅提供状态反馈时，DRL学习到低频旋转控制策略，实现80%振动抑制；增加历史控制动作后，学习到高频旋转控制策略，实现超过95%振动衰减。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习在真实实验环境中具有适应性，能够克服执行器延迟等仪器限制，为主动流动控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV)
in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary
actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number
numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a
challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints
such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state
feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL
agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%
vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While
this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance
achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is
attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning
algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a
high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex
shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate
the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to
overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

Motivation: 探究基于策略强化学习的视觉语言动作模型是否隐式学习世界模型，这是基于模型强化学习的重要特征。

Method: 使用状态表示的嵌入算术方法，通过线性和非线性探针分析模型各层激活，测试状态转移向量的可恢复性。

Result: 发现OpenVLA在状态转移预测上具有统计显著的预测能力，表明其编码了内部世界模型，且这种能力随训练进展而出现。

Conclusion: 视觉语言动作模型确实隐式学习世界模型，为利用稀疏自编码器分析其世界模型提供了基础。

Abstract: Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement
learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling
environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly
learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental
methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe
whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent
knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between
embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition
vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non
linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically
significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines
(embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as
opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the
predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that
the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline
leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的框架，通过动态预测器和优化代理网络来高效解决PDE约束优化问题，在保持解质量的同时显著提升计算速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDE约束优化问题在科学和工程领域广泛存在，但传统方法计算成本高，需要处理高维离散化和动态约束。决策变量与PDE状态变量的紧密耦合使得问题计算密集。

Method: 采用双网络设计：动态预测器（时间离散神经算子）近似PDE动力学系统轨迹，优化代理网络利用代理优化技术近似最优决策。这种设计能显式捕捉决策与PDE动力学的耦合关系。

Result: 在Burgers方程、热方程和电压调节等基准任务上验证，解质量与经典控制算法（直接法和模型预测控制）相当，但计算速度提升了四个数量级。

Conclusion: 该学习框架能实时近似最优策略，为PDE约束优化问题提供了高效解决方案，在保持解质量的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many
scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and
material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control
inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables,
and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints.
This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires
handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that
integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic
predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently
approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the
optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to
approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables
real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the
coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach
on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation,
heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution
quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct
Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of
magnitude improvement in computational speed.

Result: SAIP在各种图像恢复任务中持续提升重建质量，包括具有挑战性的场景

Conclusion: SAIP通过自适应尺度调整有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为扩散模型在逆问题中的应用提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks
such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a
Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score
with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable,
estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these
methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood
contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies
across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address
this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the
scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone.
SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves
reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: CURA是一种受模拟音频信号处理电路启发的紧凑型AI架构，在资源受限环境中实现跨域机器学习任务，相比现有方法参数减少2500倍，同时在回归、分类、NLP和计算机视觉任务中保持良好性能。

Motivation: 解决现有设备端AI架构的两个关键限制：缺乏紧凑性（参数需求随任务复杂度线性增长）和泛化能力差（特定领域模型无法适应其他应用）。

Method: 提出CURA架构，灵感来源于模拟音频信号处理电路，提供跨多个领域的紧凑轻量级机器学习解决方案。

Result: 在紧凑性方面，使用比基线模型少2500倍的参数达到同等准确率；在泛化性方面，在四个NLP基准和一个计算机视觉数据集上表现一致，F1分数高达90%；在复杂模式识别方面，平均绝对误差降低1.6倍，均方误差降低2.1倍。

Conclusion: CURA架构为资源受限环境提供了一个紧凑、泛化能力强且能识别复杂模式的AI解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments
face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter
requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor
generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains
(e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language
processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture
inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and
lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple
domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches:
(1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task
complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression,
classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern
recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely
low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains.
For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer
parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated
consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision
dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to
90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns,
achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared
error than competing models.

TL;DR: 本文比较了决策曲线分析(DCA)和成本曲线这两种模型评估方法，发现决策曲线与Brier曲线密切相关，两者在相同阈值下会选择相同的最优模型，但Brier曲线适用范围更广且其曲线下面积即为Brier分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分类模型通常使用决策阈值进行分类，适当的模型评估应考虑模型使用环境，包括正确分类正负样本的相对价值。需要比较DCA和成本曲线这两种评估方法的关系、优势和局限性。

Method: 通过理论分析和比较决策曲线分析与成本曲线（特别是Brier曲线），研究两者在假设模型分数已校准且使用相对价值设置分类阈值时的关系。

Result: 决策曲线与Brier曲线密切相关，两者x轴等价，在任何给定阈值下净收益和Brier损失都会选择相同的最优模型。Brier曲线适用范围更广，其曲线下面积即为Brier分数。

Conclusion: DCA和成本曲线在模型评估中各有优势，建议在DCA中使用上包络决策曲线来显示仅通过重新校准可能实现的净收益增益。

Abstract: Classification models typically predict a score and use a decision threshold
to produce a classification. Appropriate model evaluation should carefully
consider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative
value of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which
affects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and
cost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility
and expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision
thresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related,
and their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are
closely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both
curves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the
classification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and
negative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net
benefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always
choose the same model as optimal at any given threshold. Across thresholds,
differences in Brier loss are comparable whereas differences in net benefit
cannot be compared. Brier curves are more generally applicable (when a wider
range of thresholds are plausible), and the area under the Brier curve is the
Brier score. We demonstrate that reference lines common in each space can be
included in either and suggest the upper envelope decision curve as a useful
comparison for DCA showing the possible gain in net benefit that could be
achieved through recalibration alone.

Motivation: 大语言模型对齐面临多目标偏好的关键困境：在一个维度的改进往往以牺牲其他维度为代价，如帮助性与无害性之间的权衡。现有方法主要关注约束优化和数据选择，但忽视了参数层面的根本冲突解决。

Method: 提出OrthAlign方法，利用正交子空间分解将参数更新空间分解为正交子空间，确保不同偏好的优化在数学上不干扰的方向进行，并提供理论保证证明参数增量满足正交子空间约束和谱范数界限时，更新呈现线性Lipschitz增长而非指数不稳定性。

Conclusion: OrthAlign通过正交子空间分解从根本上解决了多目标偏好对齐中的梯度冲突，实现了稳定收敛和显著的多维度性能提升。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

Abstract: By embedding physical intuition, network architectures enforce fundamental
properties, such as energy conservation laws, leading to plausible predictions.
Yet, scaling these models to intrinsically high-dimensional systems remains a
significant challenge. This paper introduces Geometric Reduced-order
Hamiltonian Neural Network (RO-HNN), a novel physics-inspired neural network
that combines the conservation laws of Hamiltonian mechanics with the
scalability of model order reduction. RO-HNN is built on two core components: a
novel geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder that learns a
low-dimensional, structure-preserving symplectic submanifold, and a geometric
Hamiltonian neural network that models the dynamics on the submanifold. Our
experiments demonstrate that RO-HNN provides physically-consistent, stable, and
generalizable predictions of complex high-dimensional dynamics, thereby
effectively extending the scope of Hamiltonian neural networks to
high-dimensional physical systems.

Motivation: 大语言模型在组合推理任务中经常失败，特别是在"两跳推理诅咒"现象中表现不佳，需要解决这种组合性差距。

Method: 引入Identity Bridge机制，在零跳身份任务上监督模型；使用简化的Emb-MLP模型进行理论分析；通过小初始化或权重衰减增强正则化效果；扩展到大规模模型研究。

Result: 身份监督重塑了模型的潜在几何结构，通过隐式核范数正则化促进低秩解，使模型能够成功进行分布外两跳推理；大规模模型通过潜在记忆实现两跳推理。

Conclusion: Identity Bridge机制有效解决组合推理问题，身份监督通过几何结构对齐增强模型推理能力，为提升大语言模型隐含推理能力提供重要启示。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at
compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of
two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet
powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the
model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this
addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop
reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon,
we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving
that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this
alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during
optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across
tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to
enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment
effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our
investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop
reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for
enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

Motivation: 语言模型越来越多地应用于蛋白质和mRNA等生物序列，但默认的欧几里得几何可能与生物数据固有的层次结构不匹配。双曲几何为容纳层次数据提供了更好的替代方案，但尚未应用于mRNA序列的语言建模。

Method: 采用混合设计，在欧几里得骨干网络之上添加双曲层，实现mRNA序列在双曲空间中的掩码语言模型预训练。

Result: 在多个多物种数据集上，在10个属性预测任务中有9个优于欧几里得基线，平均提升10%；在长序列和低GC含量序列的分布外泛化方面表现优异；在抗体区域注释任务中，比层次感知的欧几里得模型准确率提高3%。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为mRNA序列的层次语言建模提供了有效的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like
proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the
hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry
provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet
to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we
introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model
pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with
hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned
representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship
between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it
outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property
prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution
generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region
annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation
accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive
bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

Motivation: 解决现有个性化方法对新用户的冷启动问题，这些方法通常需要大量用户数据或资源密集型微调

Method: 结合测试时对齐和dueling bandits，通过在线学习奖励函数来引导冻结LLM的解码过程，智能查询用户以平衡探索和利用

Result: 实验表明T-POP实现了快速且数据高效的个性化，显著优于现有基线方法，并随着用户交互增加而持续改进

Conclusion: T-POP为LLM实时个性化提供了一种有效的新范式，解决了冷启动问题

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is
a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However,
current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically
require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of
pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address
this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by
learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text
generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference
Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment
with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the
decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that
captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently
queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and
exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient
personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing
consistent improvement with more user interactions.

TL;DR: 提出了FedPOB和FedPOB-Pref两种联邦提示优化算法，基于多臂老虎机框架，解决了大语言模型提示优化的黑盒性、样本效率和隐私保护三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的性能对输入提示高度敏感，但实际应用面临三大挑战：(1) 强大专有LLM的黑盒性质，(2) 由于查询成本需要高样本效率，(3) 多用户间隐私保护协作的需求。

Method: 基于多臂老虎机框架，提出FedPOB（联邦线性UCB算法）和FedPOB-Pref（基于联邦决斗老虎机的偏好反馈算法），通过共享模型参数而非原始数据实现协作。

Result: 大量实验表明，FedPOB和FedPOB-Pref显著优于现有基线方法，且随着参与代理数量的增加，性能持续提升，验证了联邦方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机框架是解决联邦提示优化问题的理想选择，既能处理黑盒优化，又具有实际样本效率，还能实现理论上有保证的协作学习收益。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
input prompt, making prompt optimization a critical task. However, real-world
application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of
powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query
costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple
users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel
framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on
multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this
problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2)
practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with
theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first
propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a
federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by
sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to
the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with
Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated
dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and
FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their
performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the
collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.

Result: 该方法为奖励模型失败提供了理论洞见，并为提高长尾鲁棒性提供了实际干预措施。

Conclusion: 通过机制可解释性框架识别专门神经回路，可以改善奖励模型在长尾分布上的性能，提供理论和实践上的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit
systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and
misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that
identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in
reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization
for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we
hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for
longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections
between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail
performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which
uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble
strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model
failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散变分自编码器中的离散随机变量无法进行精确可微参数化，现有方法如Gumbel-Softmax重参数化或REINFORCE在高维任务中效果有限，需要更有效的训练方法。

Method: 结合策略搜索技术，利用非参数编码器的自然梯度更新参数编码器，无需重参数化，配合自动步长适应和基于transformer的编码器。

Result: 在ImageNet等挑战性数据集上优于近似重参数化方法和基于量化的离散自编码器，在紧凑潜在空间中重建高维数据，ImageNet 256的FID分数提升20%。

Conclusion: 该方法为离散变分自编码器提供了一种有效的训练框架，在高维数据重建任务中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit
efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions,
enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However,
discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable
parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations,
such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient
estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that
have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image
reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a
training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a
non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring
reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation
and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as
ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and
quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional
data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for
ImageNet 256.

TL;DR: Q-Net是一个数据高效且可解释的队列长度估计框架，融合环检测器数据和聚合浮动车数据，使用AI增强的卡尔曼滤波器在部分观测条件下稳健工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信号交叉口队列长度估计在部分观测条件下具有挑战性，传统方法依赖交通守恒假设且易受数据融合问题影响。

Method: 结合环检测器车辆计数和聚合浮动车数据，使用定制状态空间模型和KalmanNet（学习卡尔曼增益的AI增强滤波器），解耦测量维度与路段长度。

Conclusion: Q-Net具有良好的时空可转移性，无需昂贵传感基础设施，其实时变体可集成到动态队列控制系统中。

Abstract: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in
traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where
vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a
data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that
performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated.
Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i)
vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated
floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and
provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often
differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net
addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented
Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without
requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We
build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality
from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments.
Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with
internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main
roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms
baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately
tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays.
Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling
deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar.
Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its
potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.

TL;DR: 提出用catnat函数替代softmax函数，通过分层二值分割解决离散潜在变量的梯度下降学习难题，在多个任务中提升学习效率和测试性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中广泛使用的离散潜在变量（如强化学习中的动作、隐变量模型中的类别等）给梯度下降算法带来挑战，现有改进梯度估计方法存在局限。

Method: 从信息几何角度分析softmax函数的局限性，提出用catnat函数替代，该函数通过分层二值分割构建，能产生对角Fisher信息矩阵，有利于梯度下降优化。

Result: 在图结构学习、变分自编码器和强化学习等任务上的实验表明，catnat函数能提高学习效率，获得更高测试性能。

Conclusion: catnat函数易于实现，与现有代码库兼容，是比softmax更好的替代方案，且与标准训练稳定技术兼容。

Abstract: Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning
architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning
environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express
relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their
discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning
algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient
estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1)
revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its
limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the
$\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of
a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers
significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher
Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure
learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically
show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields
models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$
is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases.
Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques
and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.

Motivation: 当前多模态学习方法存在局限性，无法确保所有模态有效对齐，导致模型在下游任务中无法充分利用多模态提供的额外信息。

Method: TRIANGLE：一种新颖的相似度度量方法，直接在模态嵌入的高维空间中计算三角形面积相似度，用于改进三个模态的联合对齐。

Conclusion: TRIANGLE通过三角形面积相似度实现了三个模态的有效联合对齐，在多模态任务中取得了最先进的结果，同时提供了可解释的对齐原理。

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence
systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more
comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art
models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful
development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide
indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a
result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of
the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide
additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we
present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed
similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space
spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of
three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion
layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses
replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of
multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales.
Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text
retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves
state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of
cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

Method: 提出RPEX方法，将逆概率加权(IPW)融入在线探索策略以缓解重尾行为，实现鲁棒的策略扩展

Result: 在D4RL数据集上的广泛实验表明，RPEX在各种数据损坏场景下实现了最先进的O2O性能

Conclusion: RPEX是一种新颖、简单而有效的方法，能够显著提升离线到在线强化学习在数据损坏环境下的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online
interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has
emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both
offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often
noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O
RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline
policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data
corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still
unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed
behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of
online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability
Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate
heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed
$\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion.
Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves
SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios. Code is

Motivation: 解决当前神经网络MTPP方法需要为每个目标系统训练专门模型的问题，追求一种更通用的方法。

Method: 基于摊销推理和上下文学习，预训练深度神经网络从事件序列集合中推断条件强度函数，使用大规模合成Hawkes过程数据集进行预训练。

Result: 实验表明这种摊销方法在常见基准数据集上的下一事件预测性能与专门模型相当。

Conclusion: FIM-PP模型能够无需额外训练估计真实世界数据的MTPPs，或快速微调到目标系统，展示了摊销推理在MTPP领域的有效性。

Abstract: Modeling event sequences of multiple event types with marked temporal point
processes (MTPPs) provides a principled way to uncover governing dynamical
rules and predict future events. Current neural network approaches to MTPP
inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system.
We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and
in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context,
the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined
by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic
dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once
pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can
estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be
rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized
approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction
across common benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: 图结构在幻觉检测中发挥重要作用，结合计算轨迹具有显著优势，CHARM方法展示了良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content,
known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or
simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or
attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed
graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry
features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts
hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying
GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes
prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently
outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results
shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the
benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits
promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.

Result: 在蛋白质结构观测指标上表现优异，在多种蛋白质结构上均优于现有方法，且能很好泛化到未见序列

Conclusion: MSM Emulators和MarS-FM为蛋白质动力学模拟提供了高效准确的替代方案，显著优于现有生成方法

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing
protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long
timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address
this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate
trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag
transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but
uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM
Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states
defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class
with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two
orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD
simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through
structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary
structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues)
with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events,
and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to
assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing
methods, often by a substantial margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲电网向可再生能源转型，但风能和太阳能的天气依赖性对电网稳定性构成挑战，特别是Dunkelflaute事件可能导致电力供应短缺，需要评估其未来影响。

Method: 采用生成式深度学习框架降尺度CMIP6气候模拟，与ERA5历史数据比较统计特征，评估德国在低排放（SSP2-4.5）和高排放（SSP5-8.5）情景下的Dunkelflaute事件。

Result: 分析表明，在集合平均值中，德国Dunkelflaute事件的频率和持续时间与历史时期相比基本保持不变。

Conclusion: 在所考虑的气候情景下，Dunkelflaute事件相关的风险预计将在整个世纪内保持稳定。

Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy
sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and
solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a
challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of
low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their
potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate
the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years
and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative
deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6
ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from
ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future
occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low
(SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that
both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the
ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the
historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios,
the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.

Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical
lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress.
Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data
contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage
prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core
principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity,
strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new
large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing
data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by
exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks.
Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual
information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in
multimodal forecasting.

Method: 1) 混合分解机制结合EMA和傅里叶分解与RevIN归一化，通过噪声Top-k门控动态平衡季节和趋势分量；2) 多尺度自适应路径利用稀疏分配器将特征路由到四个并行Transformer层，通过稀疏组合器合并特征，结合局部CNN和全局交互的混合注意力；3) 双流残差学习框架，CNN和MLP分支分别处理季节和趋势分量，通过最小化专家协作方差的平衡损失函数协调。

Result: 在九个数据集上的广泛实验表明，DSAT-HD整体上优于现有方法，并在某些数据集上达到最先进的性能。该模型在各种迁移场景下也表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DSAT-HD通过创新的混合分解、多尺度自适应路径和双流残差学习框架，有效解决了时间序列预测中复杂季节性和多尺度特征的建模问题，在多个数据集上取得了优异的性能并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather,
traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series
forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches
primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging
to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional
methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require
pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed
seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive
Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the
limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining
EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing
seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale
adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four
parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,
enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A
dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately
process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function
minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine
datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also
exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer
scenarios.

Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how
the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data
are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed
regularization, we derive complexity-dependent bounds on the excess risk in
probability and in expectation. We prove that, when the physical prior
information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev
minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation

TL;DR: DyMoDreamer是一种新颖的基于模型的强化学习算法，通过动态调制机制改进动态特征提取和时间信息丰富，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>

Conclusion: DyMoDreamer通过有效提取动态特征和时间信息，显著提高了基于模型强化学习的样本效率和性能表现。

Abstract: A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample
inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive
environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates
this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate
synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world
models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects
and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally
inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly
influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we
introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic
modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich
the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived
from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level
motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic
categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model
(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k
benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new
record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\%
performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is
released at https://github.com/Ultraman-Tiga1/DyMoDreamer.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the
measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information
for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation
models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations
directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and
clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction
heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to
capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce
Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles
into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level
embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language
models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,
tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to
unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification
accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based
similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.
These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language
offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable
outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of
unseen cells.

Method: 使用逻辑回归、随机森林和梯度提升(XGBoost)三种机器学习模型，分析流媒体流行度、音频信号属性和人类收听概率指标对榜单入选的预测能力。

Result: 流行度是最决定性预测因子，逻辑回归准确率90.0%，随机森林90.4%，XGBoost 90.3%。所有模型在榜单歌曲召回率都很高(0.969-0.992)，非榜单歌曲召回率稍低(0.813-0.837)。

Abstract: The advent of digital streaming platforms have recently revolutionized the
landscape of music industry, with the ensuing digitalization providing
structured data collections that open new research avenues for investigating
popularity dynamics and mainstream success. The present work explored which
determinants hold the strongest predictive influence for a track's inclusion in
the Billboard Hot 100 charts, including streaming popularity, measurable audio
signal attributes, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. The
analysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of
Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from
instrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness. Logistic Regression
achieved 90.0% accuracy, with very high recall for charting singles (0.986) but
lower recall for non-charting ones (0.813), yielding balanced F1-scores around
0.90. Random Forest slightly improved performance to 90.4% accuracy,
maintaining near-perfect precision for non-charting singles (0.990) and high
recall for charting ones (0.992), with F1-scores up to 0.91. Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) reached 90.3% accuracy, delivering a more balanced trade-off by
improving recall for non-charting singles (0.837) while sustaining high recall
for charting ones (0.969), resulting in F1-scores comparable to the other
models.

*Jiayi Li,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT-Net提出了一种双分支神经网络架构，通过谱分支和图像分支分别处理全局低频信息和局部细节，解决了现有PDE基础模型中全局耦合不足的问题，在Navier-Stokes基准测试中显著降低了误差并提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多尺度窗口自注意力的PDE基础模型（如scOT）由于局部性限制，全局谱耦合只能通过深度堆叠和窗口移动逐渐传播，这削弱了全局耦合，导致闭环推演中的误差累积和漂移。

Method: 采用双分支设计：谱分支负责捕获全局大尺度低频信息，图像分支专注于局部细节和非平稳结构。通过受控的轻量级低频混合和带权融合策略，避免简单拼接导致的宽度膨胀和训练不稳定。

Result: 在相同训练设置和预算下，相比强注意力基线，DRIFT-Net实现了更低的误差和更高的吞吐量，参数数量减少约15%。在Navier-Stokes基准测试中，相对L1误差降低7%-54%，吞吐量仍高于scOT。

Conclusion: DRIFT-Net通过双分支架构有效解决了PDE神经网络求解器中全局耦合不足的问题，在保持全局结构和高频细节的同时，显著提升了精度和效率。

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve
wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers.
In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale
windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \textsc{Poseidon} serving as
a representative example.
  However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral
coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window
shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and
drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral
branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing
global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses
on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform
controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the
spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the
width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The
fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image
branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details
across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net
achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under
identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the
relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\%--54\%, the parameter count decreases
by about 15\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies
and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of
this design. The code is available at
https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/DRIFT-Net.

Conclusion: 保形预测能够有效提升土壤剖面模型在人机协作标注中的效率，特别是在回归任务中表现显著，为有限标注预算下的模型应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential in human-machine collaboration, as
human agents tend to adjust their decisions based on the confidence of the
machine counterpart. Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable
more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible
usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well
established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models,
offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and
classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to
$\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles.
We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a
limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is
available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that
conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks
and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same
annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart. All code

Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning,
yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models.
In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic
and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging
connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed
phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of
sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between
distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely
reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish
a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained
network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide
a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the
emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization
performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.

Abstract: Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning,
enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form.
Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during
training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation
theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive
canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends
both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive
canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the
input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove
that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that
admit universal approximation properties.
  We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis
ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational
symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular
and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our
adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to
equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and
equivariant architectures.

TL;DR: 本研究通过SRV表示和图过滤方法分析蛋白质语言模型的序列表示空间，发现模型在中间层编码最结构忠实的信息，且偏好编码局部残基关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然蛋白质语言模型是蛋白质设计的重要研究方向，但其如何将序列转换为隐藏表示以及这些表示包含的信息尚未完全理解。现有工作主要关注单个序列的转换，而整个序列空间及其关系的转换方式仍未知。

Method: 使用平方根速度(SRV)表示和图过滤方法，将蛋白质结构和表示转化为可比较的度量空间。分析不同ESM2模型层中的Karcher均值和有效维度，以及通过图过滤研究模型编码结构特征的上下文长度。

Result: SRV形状空间的Karcher均值和有效维度随模型层数呈现非线性模式。PLMs优先编码残基间的即时和局部关系，但在较大上下文长度下性能下降。最结构忠实的编码通常出现在接近但未达到最后一层的中间层。

Conclusion: 在PLMs的中间层而非最后一层训练折叠模型可能获得更好的折叠性能，因为该层编码了最结构忠实的信息。

Abstract: While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of
research for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform
sequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such
representations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to
propose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding
how individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in
which PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is
still unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of
sequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root
velocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally
lead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations
can be compared with each other.
  We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that
the Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a
non-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different
sizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context
lengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find
that PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between
residues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most
structurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last
layer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these
layers might lead to improved folding performance.

Conclusion: 研究阐明了每种训练范式的适用场景，提倡超越平均后悔的定制奖励设计和评估，以促进稳健的探索行为。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了在抗体贝叶斯优化中融入结构信息的不同方法，并与仅基于序列的方法进行比较。研究发现结构信息在早期优化中能提高稳定性优化的数据效率，但加入蛋白质语言模型软约束后，序列方法能达到与结构方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗体治疗特性优化通常是迭代且昂贵的，贝叶斯优化是自然选择。但为高度结构化的抗体空间选择最优代理模型很困难，且可能因优化属性而异。此前没有研究尝试将结构信息融入抗体贝叶斯优化。

Method: 探索了将结构信息融入贝叶斯优化的不同方法，与多种仅序列方法在抗体结合亲和力和稳定性两个属性上进行比较。提出了基于蛋白质语言模型的"软约束"来引导优化到有前景的空间区域。

Result: 某些类型的结构信息在早期优化轮次中提高了稳定性的数据效率，但峰值性能相当。加入蛋白质语言模型软约束后，亲和力的数据效率差距减小，稳定性的差距消除，序列方法能与结构方法性能匹配。

Conclusion: 研究结果对贝叶斯优化中结构信息的必要性提出了质疑，表明在适当的软约束下，仅序列方法可以达到与结构方法相当的性能。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody
therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However,
finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly
structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the
property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior
works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody
Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to
incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare
them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody
properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of
a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the
optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of
structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for
stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating
the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap
is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in
sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods,
raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for
antibodies.

Abstract: As a powerful technique in generative modeling, Flow Matching (FM) aims to
learn velocity fields from noise to data, which is often explained and
implemented as solving Optimal Transport (OT) problems. In this study, we
bridge FM and the recent theory of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT),
developing an improved FM method called OAT-FM and exploring its benefits in
both theory and practice. In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening
objective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent
to minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT.
Accordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the
acceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose
objective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow
straightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low
complexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative
model trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been
relatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm
eliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large
number of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in
various generative tasks. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出一种新的深度Q学习方法，通过正则化减少状态特征表示之间的正相关性，使线性函数逼近在迁移学习中更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习训练需要大量超参数调优和计算成本，迁移学习可以重用已有知识避免从头训练。但标准深度RL模型学到的表示高度相关，限制了线性函数逼近的效果。

Method: 提出带正则化项的深度Q学习方法，减少状态特征表示之间的正相关性，使用降相关特征进行线性函数逼近。

Result: 在标准RL基准和MinAtar游戏上的实验表明，该方法能提高迁移学习性能并减少计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过减少特征相关性，可以更有效地在迁移学习中使用线性函数逼近，降低计算成本。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex
sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL
framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as
the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.
Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these
challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for
new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from
scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage
the internal representations learned by the neural network during training.
Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as
refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the
input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used
as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on
new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL
models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used
with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a
novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce
positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging
these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear
function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation
studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby
reducing computational overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DUCHESS是一个LLM服务系统，通过分支编排和复杂度预测来降低推理延迟和token使用量，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理算法（如思维链、多分支推理）显著增加了token使用和延迟，而先前工作主要关注减少token使用但牺牲了准确性，忽略了其他延迟因素。

Method: 使用轻量级线性探测模型基于LLM层激活估计分支正确性，编排策略决定终止、复制或继续分支；在多请求处理中通过复杂度估计优先处理简单任务。

Result: 在三个推理基准测试中，DUCHESS将token使用量减少42-63%（在相同准确度下）；在vLLM服务中，平均、中位数和尾部延迟分别降低57-81%、58-85%和52-84%。

Conclusion: DUCHESS通过智能分支编排和难度感知调度，显著降低了LLM推理的成本和延迟，同时保持了准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time reasoning
algorithms such as chain-of-thought and multi-branch reasoning to improve
accuracy on complex tasks. These methods, however, substantially increase token
usage and per-request latency. Prior work has largely focused on reducing token
usage, often at the expense of accuracy, while overlooking other latency
factors. We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and
latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration
guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over
LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration
policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When
handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing
easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt.
Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently
improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at
matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, DUCHESS
reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% with
First-Come-First-Served scheduling, and achieves additional gains under
difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的重叠自适应正则化(OAR)方法，通过根据重叠权重比例调整正则化强度，在低重叠区域提高CATE估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CATE元学习方法在低重叠区域表现不佳，需要一种能适应不同重叠程度的正则化方法来改善性能。

Method: 引入重叠自适应正则化(OAR)，根据重叠权重比例调整正则化强度，在低重叠区域施加更强的正则化。该方法适用于参数和非参数二阶模型，并提出了保持Neyman正交性的去偏版本。

Result: 通过(半)合成实验证明，OAR在低重叠设置下相比恒定正则化显著改善了CATE估计性能。

Conclusion: OAR是首个在元学习器正则化项中利用重叠权重的方法，能有效提升低重叠区域的CATE估计质量。

Abstract: The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is widely used in
personalized medicine to inform therapeutic decisions. However,
state-of-the-art methods for CATE estimation (so-called meta-learners) often
perform poorly in the presence of low overlap. In this work, we introduce a new
approach to tackle this issue and improve the performance of existing
meta-learners in the low-overlap regions. Specifically, we introduce
Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) that regularizes target models
proportionally to overlap weights so that, informally, the regularization is
higher in regions with low overlap. To the best of our knowledge, our OAR is
the first approach to leverage overlap weights in the regularization terms of
the meta-learners. Our OAR approach is flexible and works with any existing
CATE meta-learner: we demonstrate how OAR can be applied to both parametric and
non-parametric second-stage models. Furthermore, we propose debiased versions
of our OAR that preserve the Neyman-orthogonality of existing meta-learners and
thus ensure more robust inference. Through a series of (semi-)synthetic
experiments, we demonstrate that our OAR significantly improves CATE estimation
in low-overlap settings in comparison to constant regularization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据稀缺推动了对更高效样本利用的大语言模型的需求，需要系统比较不同模型的样本效率

Method: 利用双下降现象全面比较离散扩散模型和自回归模型的样本效率，分析不同参数化阶段的模型行为

Result: 离散扩散模型需要更大容量和更多训练轮次才能达到插值阈值；在强过参数化阶段，两种模型表现相似，都没有明显的测试损失二次下降

Conclusion: 自回归模型在小规模数据集上样本效率更高，离散扩散模型只有在获得足够容量和计算资源时才具有竞争力

Abstract: Data scarcity drives the need for more sample-efficient large language
models. In this work, we use the double descent phenomenon to holistically
compare the sample efficiency of discrete diffusion and autoregressive models.
We show that discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and more
training epochs to escape their underparameterized regime and reach the
interpolation threshold. In the strongly overparameterized regime, both models
exhibit similar behavior, with neither exhibiting a pronounced second descent
in test loss across a large range of model sizes. Overall, our results indicate
that autoregressive models are more sample-efficient on small-scale datasets,
while discrete diffusion models only become competitive when given sufficient
capacity and compute.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ROVER方法，一种简化的强化学习方法，通过随机策略评估来优化数学推理，避免了传统PPO等方法的复杂性和不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于PPO和GRPO的RLVR方法存在训练不稳定性和多样性崩溃问题，需要复杂的启发式技巧和精细调参。研究发现数学推理中的RLVR可以形式化为具有确定性状态转移和树状结构的特殊MDP，结构比通用控制问题更简单。

Method: ROVER方法基于一个关键发现：最优动作可以从固定均匀随机策略的Q函数中恢复。该方法采样基于这些均匀策略Q值的softmax分布的动作，绕过了传统策略迭代循环。

Result: 在多个基础模型和标准数学推理基准测试中，ROVER在质量（pass@1提升8.2，pass@256提升16.8）和多样性（提升17.6%）方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: ROVER是一种极简但高效的强化学习方法，能够在训练过程中保持多样性，持续探索多个有效路径，相比现有复杂方法实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current
methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,
which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating
the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While
effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,
requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard
RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov
Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured
dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying
structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated
techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this
insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from
the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the
generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce
Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this
principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a
minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax
over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout
training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across
multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates
superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1,
\textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite
its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.

TL;DR: 本文从函数空间角度重新审视PPO算法，在再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)中解耦策略评估和改进：使用核化TD评论家进行高效梯度更新，通过KL正则化的自然梯度策略步骤恢复PPO/TRPO风格的近端更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为PPO算法提供更坚实的理论基础，超越有限维假设，阐明在连续状态-动作空间中RKHS近端更新与核TD评论家何时能实现全局策略改进和实际效率。

Method: 在RKHS中解耦策略评估和改进：(1)使用核化TD评论家进行一步状态-动作转移样本的RKHS梯度更新；(2)KL正则化的自然梯度策略步骤对评估的动作值进行指数化，恢复PPO/TRPO风格的近端更新。

Result: 提供了非渐近、实例自适应的理论保证，其速率取决于RKHS熵，统一了表格、线性、Sobolev、高斯和神经正切核(NTK)机制。经验上，理论对齐的调度在常见控制任务中提高了稳定性和样本效率。

Conclusion: 该工作将PPO建立在更坚实的理论基础上，阐明了在连续状态-动作空间中RKHS近端更新与核TD评论家能够实现全局策略改进并具有实际效率的条件。

Abstract: We revisit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from a function-space
perspective. Our analysis decouples policy evaluation and improvement in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS): (i) A kernelized temporal-difference
(TD) critic performs efficient RKHS-gradient updates using only one-step
state-action transition samples; (ii) a KL-regularized, natural-gradient policy
step exponentiates the evaluated action-value, recovering a PPO/TRPO-style
proximal update in continuous state-action spaces. We provide non-asymptotic,
instance-adaptive guarantees whose rates depend on RKHS entropy, unifying
tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regimes,
and we derive a sampling rule for the proximal update that ensures the optimal
$k^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. Empirically, the
theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on common
control tasks (e.g., CartPole, Acrobot), while our TD-based critic attains
favorable throughput versus a GAE baseline. Altogether, our results place PPO
on a firmer theoretical footing beyond finite-dimensional assumptions and
clarify when RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics yield global policy
improvement with practical efficiency.

Motivation: 扩散模型的成员推理攻击已成为紧迫的隐私问题，需要理解这些模型如何无意中泄露训练集信息。

Method: 基于理论分析预测噪声向量指向训练样本的局部均值，提出SimA单查询攻击方法，比较DDPM和潜在扩散模型的安全性。

Result: SimA在多种扩散模型变体上表现稳定，潜在扩散模型由于潜在自编码器的信息瓶颈而相对更安全。

Conclusion: 巩固了基于分数的成员推理攻击理论，强调需要更好理解VAE反演而不仅仅是扩散过程反演。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as
a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a
given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and
empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors
that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser
output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples,
such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals
membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query
attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing
multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across
variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent
Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due
to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We
further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters
($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM
training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based
MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better
understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion
process

Motivation: 野火是严重的自然灾害，深度学习在预测野火危险方面显示出潜力，但由于缺乏不确定性量化，其可靠性受到质疑。

Method: 开发不确定性感知的深度学习框架，同时捕捉认知不确定性（模型）和偶然不确定性（数据），用于短期野火危险预测。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了野火危险预测的准确性和可靠性，推进了可信赖野火深度学习系统的发展。

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant
threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires
increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also
reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;
however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its
predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To
address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that
jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance
short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our
best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected
Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both
predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of
the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision
support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting
low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire
danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast
horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with
time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic
uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty
types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary
insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their
joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger
forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

TL;DR: MARCOS提出了一种新的LLM推理范式，将推理建模为连续高维思想的隐马尔可夫链，而不是传统的token级链式思维，实现了更高效的推理和更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前链式思维推理存在三个主要问题：推理速度慢且计算成本高、推理受限于离散token空间、推理与token生成耦合导致短视推理。

Method: 将推理建模为连续高维思想的隐马尔可夫链，每个推理步骤对应内部思想的转换，显式推理步骤作为可观测变量。提出两阶段变分训练方案来解决潜在过程与监督学习不兼容的问题。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MARCOS优于现有连续推理方法，首次达到与token级链式思维相当的性能，在GSM8K上甚至超过4.7%，推理速度提升高达15.7倍。

Conclusion: MARCOS为LLM推理提供了新范式，具有推理效率高、支持步骤级控制等优势，为强化学习和推理开辟了新机会。

Abstract: The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves
models "thinking out loud" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought
(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.
Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT
tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains
reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck
across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with
token generation, forcing LLMs to "think while speaking," which causes
potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we
re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our
approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as
a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional "thoughts". Each
reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit
reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable
variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this
latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we
further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on
three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous
reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to
token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup
in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as
step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant
opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Aging infrastructure portfolios pose a critical resource allocation
challenge: deciding which structures require intervention and which can safely
remain in service. Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between
cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that
do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN)
surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge
types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale
database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric
pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio,
the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural
analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated
epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware
triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where
refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to
significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and
physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.

Method: 采用平均场相互作用粒子系统模型，在中等相互作用机制下分析token动力学，考虑token数量大且逆温度参数与token数量共同缩放的情况。

Result: 发现系统动力学呈现多尺度行为：快速阶段token经验测度坍缩到低维空间，中间阶段进一步坍缩成簇，慢速阶段簇逐步合并为单一簇。

Conclusion: 严格刻画了各阶段的极限动力学，证明了上述极限下的收敛性，并通过仿真验证了结果。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of tokens through the depth of
encoder-only transformer models at inference time by modeling them as a system
of particles interacting in a mean-field way and studying the corresponding
dynamics. More specifically, we consider this problem in the moderate
interaction regime, where the number $N$ of tokens is large and the inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ of the model scales together with $N$. In this
regime, the dynamics of the system displays a multiscale behavior: a fast
phase, where the token empirical measure collapses on a low-dimensional space,
an intermediate phase, where the measure further collapses into clusters, and a
slow one, where such clusters sequentially merge into a single one. We provide
a rigorous characterization of the limiting dynamics in each of these phases
and prove convergence in the above mentioned limit, exemplifying our results
with some simulations.

Abstract: As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient
tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning
remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by
considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning
rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance,
where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit
invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines
learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the
original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an
efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory
invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several
existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient
tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.

Conclusion: AWM在概念和实践上统一了预训练和强化学习，降低了方差，实现了更快的收敛速度。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the
same log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for
diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),
optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow
matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is
an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases
variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce
\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for
diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a
lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect,
AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones
while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies
pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with
policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This
simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and
PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO
(which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX,
without compromising generation quality. Code is available at

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建可验证的'信任证书'奠定了基础，为评估基于AI的科学预测的可信度提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields
like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks
is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating
joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers
not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a
task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including
PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this
likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a
foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby
offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based
scientific predictions. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文证明在LLM训练中，当优化超参数根据数据预算最优设置时，不同规模的损失曲线会坍缩到通用轨迹上，这成为计算高效训练的标志。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在实用扩展配方下训练的LLM家族是否也存在损失曲线坍缩现象，以及这种现象的实际应用价值。

Method: 通过分析不同规模LLM的训练损失曲线，研究在宽度、深度、学习率、批量大小和权重衰减联合缩放时，损失曲线坍缩的条件和特征。

Result: 发现当优化超参数根据数据预算最优设置时，损失曲线确实会在不同规模间坍缩，这种坍缩现象是计算高效训练的标志。

Conclusion: 损失曲线坍缩现象为LLM训练提供了有效的诊断工具和早期停止策略，有助于开发高效的LLM模型。

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce ORPO-Distill, a general-purpose method for cross-architecture
LLM distillation that formulates the problem as a preference optimization task.
Unlike standard CoT distillation, the approach transfers knowledge through
diverse reasoning traces. It employs an Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization
objective that contrasts teacher and student traces for more effective
learning, and adopts a mixed-policy strategy for utilizing student-generated
outputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives. Experiments on
five datasets and multiple student models show consistent improvements over
conventional black-box KD baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线ptychography是一种数据密集型成像技术，需要在加速采集速率下实现实时反馈，现有深度学习方法缺乏跨不同实验条件的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用探针中心方法，将实验测量探针与程序生成的合成物体相结合进行无监督训练，强调探针学习的重要性。

Result: 该方法训练的模型在重建保真度上与仅使用实验数据训练的模型相当，即使改变合成训练对象的类型也能保持性能，实现了多探针泛化。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够训练实验引导模型，在动态实验条件下提供实时反馈，是首批展示多探针泛化的方法之一。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a data-intensive imaging technique expected to become
ubiquitous at next-generation light sources delivering many-fold increases in
coherent flux. The need for real-time feedback under accelerated acquisition
rates motivates surrogate reconstruction models like deep neural networks,
which offer orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional methods. However,
existing deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental
conditions. We propose an unsupervised training workflow emphasizing probe
learning by combining experimentally-measured probes with synthetic,
procedurally generated objects. This probe-centric approach enables a single
physics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across
multiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe
generalization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution
learning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction
fidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even
when changing the type of synthetic training object. The proposed approach
enables training of experiment-steering models that provide real-time feedback
under dynamic experimental conditions.

TL;DR: 提出SIREN方法解决RLVR中的熵崩溃和过早收敛问题，通过选择性熵正则化在数学推理任务上取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL中的朴素熵正则化在大推理模型中失效，因为巨大的动作空间和长轨迹会导致全局熵爆炸，无法有效解决熵崩溃和过早收敛问题

Method: SIREN方法采用两步熵掩码机制（top-p掩码和峰值熵掩码），将正则化转换为自锚定形式以稳定训练，将探索限制在有意义的动作和状态子集

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中，SIREN在熵相关RLVR方法中达到最优平均性能，在AIME24/25上使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B实现+6.6 maj@k提升，促进响应多样性并保持适当熵水平

Conclusion: SIREN有效缓解了LRM中RLVR常见的过早收敛问题，通过选择性熵正则化维持验证pass@k在整个训练过程中的稳定性

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了在线学习中的重放设置框架，分析了机器学习系统在自标注数据上训练时可能出现的错误强化问题。通过引入扩展阈值维度(ExThD)作为可学习性的精确度量，证明了基于闭包的算法在该设置下的最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统越来越多地在自标注数据上训练，它们面临强化错误并成为自身信念回音室的风险。需要建立理论框架来建模和分析这种现象。

Method: 引入在线学习重放设置框架：在每一轮中，学习者输出假设，对手揭示真实标签或来自先前轮次的重放标签。提出基于闭包的学习算法，并引入扩展阈值维度(ExThD)作为核心度量。

Result: 证明了ExThD是重放设置中可学习性的精确度量：基于闭包的学习者最多犯ExThD次错误，且没有算法能做得更好。重放设置比经典错误界限设置更难：某些类具有常数Littlestone维度但任意大的ExThD。

Conclusion: 重放设置为理解自标注数据学习中的错误传播提供了理论基础。ExThD是该设置下可学习性的精确特征化，基于闭包的算法是最优的。适当学习在重放设置中表现出更尖锐的分离：只有当类（几乎）是交集闭包时才能适当学习。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly train on self-annotated data, they
risk reinforcing errors and becoming echo chambers of their own beliefs. We
model this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online
Learning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis
$\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\ast(x_t)$ or
a replayed label $\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is
counted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the
SOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors.
  We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$,
and prove matching upper and lower bounds that make
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model.
A closure-based learner makes at most $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ mistakes
against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For
stochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed
class. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound
setting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper
separation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is
(almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers
$\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ bound. These results give the first tight
analysis of learning against replay adversaries, based on new results for
closure-type algorithms.

Motivation: 现有神经网络压缩技术通常需要昂贵的微调或搜索过程，在普通硬件上不实用。

Method: 提出激活感知因子分解框架和可扩展预算秩分配器，形成无需微调的BALF压缩流水线。

Result: 在ResNet-20到ResNeXt-101和视觉变换器等多种架构上验证有效性，ResNeXt-101的FLOPs减少45%而top-1准确率仅下降1个百分点。

Conclusion: BALF在无需微调的情况下实现了出色的压缩效果，适用于多种模型架构和规模。

Abstract: Neural network compression techniques typically require expensive fine-tuning
or search procedures, rendering them impractical on commodity hardware.
Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general
activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range
of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that
allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of
parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an
efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate
its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on
CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it
achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF
reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1
accuracy drop.

Motivation: 研究注意力机制如何学习选择性关注信息token，以检测弱、稀疏和罕见特征，理解其相对于线性分类器的优势。

Method: 使用稀疏token分类模型，在长序列极限下分析单层注意力分类器，并在高维状态下研究有限序列长度的训练过程。

Result: 注意力分类器在信号强度对数增长时即可实现消失的测试误差，而线性分类器需要平方根增长。仅需两次梯度更新即可使注意力权重与隐藏信号对齐。

Conclusion: 注意力机制通过自适应token选择优于非自适应线性基线，能够更有效地放大信息token并实现更好的分类性能。

Abstract: When and how can an attention mechanism learn to selectively attend to
informative tokens, thereby enabling detection of weak, rare, and sparsely
located features? We address these questions theoretically in a sparse-token
classification model in which positive samples embed a weak signal vector in a
randomly chosen subset of tokens, whereas negative samples are pure noise. In
the long-sequence limit, we show that a simple single-layer attention
classifier can in principle achieve vanishing test error when the signal
strength grows only logarithmically in the sequence length $L$, whereas linear
classifiers require $\sqrt{L}$ scaling. Moving from representational power to
learnability, we study training at finite $L$ in a high-dimensional regime,
where sample size and embedding dimension grow proportionally. We prove that
just two gradient updates suffice for the query weight vector of the attention
classifier to acquire a nontrivial alignment with the hidden signal, inducing
an attention map that selectively amplifies informative tokens. We further
derive an exact asymptotic expression for the test error and training loss of
the trained attention-based classifier, and quantify its capacity -- the
largest dataset size that is typically perfectly separable -- thereby
explaining the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive linear
baselines.

Conclusion: CCFM方法能够在保证可行性的同时维持高保真样本生成，有效解决了约束生成模型中的分布失真问题，在复杂物理系统和分子对接任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex
data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from
physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project
intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can
distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold.
Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean
samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and
accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by
proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching
(CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process,
enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining
high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in
the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating
directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to
projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a
sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show
that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in
modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations
and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.

Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for
maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor
generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's
ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three
physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii)
complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation.
Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid
configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each
inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and
out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into
which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and
efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

TL;DR: GLASS Flows提出了一种新的采样范式，通过模拟"流匹配模型中的流匹配模型"来采样马尔可夫转移，将ODE的效率与SDE的随机演化相结合，无需重新训练即可从预训练模型中获取内部流匹配模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于奖励对齐算法的流匹配和扩散模型在推理时效率受限，主要瓶颈在于这些算法依赖SDE采样方法，而SDE采样比ODE采样效率低且性能往往较差。

Method: 引入GLASS Flows采样范式，通过模拟"流匹配模型中的流匹配模型"来采样马尔可夫转移，从预训练模型中获取内部流匹配模型而无需重新训练。

Result: 在大规模文本到图像模型上，GLASS Flows消除了随机演化与效率之间的权衡，结合Feynman-Kac Steering在文本到图像生成中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GLASS Flows为流和扩散模型的推理时缩放提供了一个简单、即插即用的解决方案，结合了ODE的效率和SDE的随机演化优势。

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved
at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a
major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a
common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many
algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is
significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To
remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that
simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov
transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be
retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the
efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale
text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between
stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS
Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making
it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion
models.

Conclusion: TR2-D2为离散序列生成中的奖励引导微调提供了可靠的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising
framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is
optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While
these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from
the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current
fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal
trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion
(TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion
trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware
fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under
a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single-
and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models,
highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided
fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a central property of effective deep reinforcement
learning algorithms. Recent work has improved this through added complexity,
such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex
algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance. We
take a more principled approach by focusing on the optimization landscape of
the critic network. Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the
critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common
architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that
a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and
a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of
magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds
gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning
rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights,
we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic
algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware
principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55
proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using
significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型存在重复思维模式，减少这些模式通常会牺牲性能。本文旨在克服这种权衡，通过动态调整训练过程中的推理长度限制来实现更高效准确的推理。

Method: 采用迭代训练机制，交替进行压缩阶段（减少推理长度，强制模型在有限上下文中做出精确决策）和扩展阶段（放宽长度限制，让模型在长视野设置中探索规划）。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上训练，SIRI-low在AIME24上的性能提升43.2%，同时减少46.9%的token使用；SIRI-high达到所有方法中最高的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过在训练期间周期性地振荡输出截断长度，可以动态平衡推理中的探索和效率，收敛到两者之间的最优平衡点。

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.
