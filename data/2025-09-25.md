### [1] [Vision-Based Perception for Autonomous Vehicles in Off-Road Environment Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19378)
*Nelson Alves Ferreira Neto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非铺装道路和越野环境的自动驾驶感知系统，能够在没有预定义路径的崎岖地形中导航。开发了可配置模块化分割网络（CMSNet）框架，并创建了包含近12,000张图像的新数据集Kamino。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为露天矿场和发展中国家的自动驾驶开发低延迟智能系统，解决非均匀地形上的导航需求。

Method: 提出CMSNet框架，支持不同架构配置；使用TensorRT、C++和CUDA进行实时推理优化；在包含恶劣条件（夜间、雨天、灰尘）的新数据集Kamino上进行训练和测试。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实证实验验证了系统的有效性，实现了实时语义分割，能够在恶劣能见度条件下检测可通行区域。

Conclusion: 该系统为自动驾驶在非铺装道路和越野环境中的实际应用提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在恶劣天气和能见度条件下表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Low-latency intelligent systems are required for autonomous driving on
non-uniform terrain in open-pit mines and developing countries. This work
proposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and
off-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined
trail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is
proposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet
configurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new
images from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain,
dust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions
without explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility
impairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A
new dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating
vehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number
of labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images
from an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility. To
achieve real-time inference, CMSNet CNN layers were methodically removed and
fused using TensorRT, C++, and CUDA. Empirical experiments on two datasets
validated the proposed system's effectiveness.

### [2] [Overview of LifeCLEF Plant Identification task 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19402)
*Herve Goeau,Pierre Bonnet,Alexis Joly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了LifeCLEF 2020植物识别挑战赛，旨在通过利用植物标本馆数据来改进热带地区植物自动识别，采用跨域分类方法，训练集包含标本馆图像和少量野外照片，测试集仅包含野外照片。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前植物自动识别技术主要基于北美和西欧的物种数据，而生物多样性最丰富的热带地区数据稀缺。植物标本馆收藏了大量热带植物标本，可用于弥补这一数据缺口。

Method: 采用跨域分类方法，训练集包含数十万张植物标本馆图像和数千张野外照片，学习两个领域之间的映射关系。测试集仅使用野外照片进行模型评估。

Result: 挑战赛基于南美洲圭亚那地盾地区的约1000种植物数据集进行评估，该地区拥有世界上最丰富的植物多样性之一。

Conclusion: 植物标本馆数据可以有效补充热带地区植物识别训练数据的不足，跨域学习方法为数据稀缺地区的植物自动识别提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Automated identification of plants has improved considerably thanks to the
recent progress in deep learning and the availability of training data with
more and more photos in the field. However, this profusion of data only
concerns a few tens of thousands of species, mostly located in North America
and Western Europe, much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity
such as tropical countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists
have collected, catalogued and systematically stored plant specimens in
herbaria, particularly in tropical regions, and the recent efforts by the
biodiversity informatics community made it possible to put millions of
digitized sheets online. The LifeCLEF 2020 Plant Identification challenge (or
"PlantCLEF 2020") was designed to evaluate to what extent automated
identification on the flora of data deficient regions can be improved by the
use of herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species
mainly focused on the South America's Guiana Shield, an area known to have one
of the greatest diversity of plants in the world. The challenge was evaluated
as a cross-domain classification task where the training set consist of several
hundred thousand herbarium sheets and few thousand of photos to enable learning
a mapping between the two domains. The test set was exclusively composed of
photos in the field. This paper presents the resources and assessments of the
conducted evaluation, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the
participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

### [3] [iFinder: Structured Zero-Shot Vision-Based LLM Grounding for Dash-Cam Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19552)
*Manyi Yao,Bingbing Zhuang,Sparsh Garg,Amit Roy-Chowdhury,Christian Shelton,Manmohan Chandraker,Abhishek Aich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFinder是一个结构化的语义基础框架，通过将行车记录仪视频转换为分层可解释的数据结构，将感知与推理解耦，显著提升了大型语言模型在驾驶视频分析中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型缺乏领域特定的归纳偏置，现有视频视觉语言模型在驾驶视频分析中难以进行空间推理、因果推断和事件解释，特别是当视觉是唯一可用模态时。

Method: iFinder采用模块化、无需训练的方法，使用预训练视觉模型提取关键线索（物体姿态、车道位置、物体轨迹），并将其组织成帧级和视频级结构，结合三块提示策略实现逐步推理。

Result: 在四个公开行车记录仪视频基准测试中，iFinder在零样本驾驶基准上显著优于端到端视频视觉语言模型，事故推理准确率提升高达39%。

Conclusion: 通过将大型语言模型与驾驶领域特定表示相结合，iFinder为零样本、可解释且可靠的事后驾驶视频理解提供了替代端到端视频视觉语言模型的方案。

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc
dash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose
training and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole
modality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing
video-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning,
causal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end,
we introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples
perception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical,
interpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular,
training-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract
critical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which
are hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined
with a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning
for the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning.
Evaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's
proposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and
global context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot
driving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By
grounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a
zero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for
post-hoc driving video understanding.

### [4] [CURE: Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure for Facial Recognition Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19562)
*Fnu Shivam,Nima Najafzadeh,Yenumula Reddy,Prashnna Gyawali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CURE是首个用于人脸识别系统的无监督遗忘框架，无需身份标签即可有效移除目标样本，同时保持整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸识别系统存在隐私问题，需要数据移除功能，但现有遗忘技术依赖监督方法需要身份标签，这在隐私受限或大规模嘈杂数据集中往往不可用。

Method: 提出CURE（基于质心的无监督表示擦除）框架，通过无监督方式移除特定用户数据的影响，同时提出新的评估指标UES（遗忘效率分数）来平衡遗忘和保留稳定性。

Result: CURE显著优于现有遗忘方法的无监督变体，并通过将低质量图像指定为遗忘集展示了其可用性和优势，凸显了图像质量在机器遗忘中的作用。

Conclusion: CURE填补了无监督遗忘技术的关键空白，为人脸识别系统提供了有效的隐私保护解决方案，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: In the current digital era, facial recognition systems offer significant
utility and have been widely integrated into modern technological
infrastructures; however, their widespread use has also raised serious privacy
concerns, prompting regulations that mandate data removal upon request. Machine
unlearning has emerged as a powerful solution to address this issue by
selectively removing the influence of specific user data from trained models
while preserving overall model performance. However, existing machine
unlearning techniques largely depend on supervised techniques requiring
identity labels, which are often unavailable in privacy-constrained situations
or in large-scale, noisy datasets. To address this critical gap, we introduce
CURE (Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure), the first
unsupervised unlearning framework for facial recognition systems that operates
without the use of identity labels, effectively removing targeted samples while
preserving overall performance. We also propose a novel metric, the Unlearning
Efficiency Score (UES), which balances forgetting and retention stability,
addressing shortcomings in the current evaluation metrics. CURE significantly
outperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods. Additionally,
we conducted quality-aware unlearning by designating low-quality images as the
forget set, demonstrating its usability and benefits, and highlighting the role
of image quality in machine unlearning.

### [5] [Synthesizing Artifact Dataset for Pixel-level Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19589)
*Dennis Menn,Feng Liang,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种自动注入伪影到干净合成图像的方法，无需人工标注即可获得像素级标注，用于训练伪影检测器


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练伪影检测器需要昂贵的像素级人工标注，缺乏标注数据限制了检测器性能，而传统的伪标注方法存在噪声标签问题

Method: 设计伪影污染流水线，自动在干净的合成图像预定区域注入伪影，从而无需人工标注即可获得像素级标注数据

Result: 该方法训练的伪影检测器在ConvNeXt上性能提升13.2%，在Swin-T上提升3.7%，优于基线方法

Conclusion: 这是向可扩展的像素级伪影标注数据集迈出的第一步，将世界知识整合到伪影检测中

Abstract: Artifact detectors have been shown to enhance the performance of
image-generative models by serving as reward models during fine-tuning. These
detectors enable the generative model to improve overall output fidelity and
aesthetics. However, training the artifact detector requires expensive
pixel-level human annotations that specify the artifact regions. The lack of
annotated data limits the performance of the artifact detector. A naive
pseudo-labeling approach-training a weak detector and using it to annotate
unlabeled images-suffers from noisy labels, resulting in poor performance. To
address this, we propose an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically
injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on a predetermined
region, thereby producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling. The
proposed method enables training of an artifact detector that achieves
performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T, as verified
on human-labeled data, compared to baseline approaches. This work represents an
initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that
integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.

### [6] [Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Learning via Progressive Task-Specific Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19602)
*Neeraj Gangwar,Anshuka Rangi,Rishabh Deshmukh,Holakou Rahmanian,Yesh Dattatreya,Nickvash Kani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种渐进式任务特定的多任务适配方法，通过在前几层共享适配器模块，在后续层逐渐增加任务特异性，以减少任务干扰并提高参数效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决参数高效微调方法在多任务学习中面临的任务干扰和负迁移问题，特别是在参数数量有限的情况下

Method: 在预训练模型中引入适配器模块，初始层共享所有任务，后续层逐渐任务特定化；提出基于梯度的任务相似性计算方法，将相似任务分配到共享适配器模块

Result: 在PASCAL和NYUD-v2数据集上的实验表明，该方法仅需五分之一的参数就能超越完全微调的多任务模型，在参数效率和性能方面均优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过渐进式任务特定化策略有效解决了多任务学习中的任务冲突问题，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了性能

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged as a promising solution
for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. While these
methods perform well in single-task learning, extending them to multi-task
learning exacerbates common challenges, such as task interference and negative
transfer, due to the limited number of trainable parameters. To address these
issues, we introduce progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation, a novel
parameter-efficient approach for multi-task learning. This approach introduces
adapter modules in a pre-trained model such that these modules are shared
across all tasks in the initial layers and become progressively more
task-specific in the later layers. The motivation is to reduce the conflicts
among tasks by allowing transfer learning across all tasks in the initial
layers and enabling task-specific learning toward the prediction heads.
Additionally, we propose a gradient-based approach for computing task
similarity and use this measure to allocate similar tasks to the shared adapter
modules. Our task similarity method introduces minimal overhead in the
pipeline. We evaluate our approach by adapting the Swin Transformer for dense
prediction tasks. Experiments on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms a fully fine-tuned multi-task model while
requiring only one-fifth of the trainable parameters. This approach achieves
better relative improvement to single-task fine-tuning while reducing the
number of trainable parameters and surpasses the current state-of-the-art
methods for parameter-efficient multi-task learning.

### [7] [Raw-JPEG Adapter: Efficient Raw Image Compression with JPEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19624)
*Mahmoud Afifi,Ran Zhang,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RawJPEG Adapter是一种轻量级、可学习且可逆的预处理管道，可将原始图像适配为标准JPEG压缩，实现高保真原始数据重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始数据（如DNG格式）保留完整传感器信息但存储需求大，而JPEG格式压缩效率高但不适合原始存储。需要一种方法在保持JPEG优势的同时支持原始数据重建。

Method: 应用空间和可选频域变换，将紧凑参数存储在JPEG注释字段中，实现可逆的原始图像适配JPEG压缩。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法比直接JPEG存储具有更高保真度，支持其他编解码器，并在压缩比和重建精度之间提供有利权衡。

Conclusion: RawJPEG Adapter为受限场景下的原始图像存储提供了一种实用的解决方案，平衡了压缩效率和重建质量。

Abstract: Digital cameras digitize scene light into linear raw representations, which
the image signal processor (ISP) converts into display-ready outputs. While raw
data preserves full sensor information--valuable for editing and vision
tasks--formats such as Digital Negative (DNG) require large storage, making
them impractical in constrained scenarios. In contrast, JPEG is a widely
supported format, offering high compression efficiency and broad compatibility,
but it is not well-suited for raw storage. This paper presents RawJPEG Adapter,
a lightweight, learnable, and invertible preprocessing pipeline that adapts raw
images for standard JPEG compression. Our method applies spatial and optional
frequency-domain transforms, with compact parameters stored in the JPEG comment
field, enabling accurate raw reconstruction. Experiments across multiple
datasets show that our method achieves higher fidelity than direct JPEG
storage, supports other codecs, and provides a favorable trade-off between
compression ratio and reconstruction accuracy.

*William L. Muckelroy III,Mohammed Alsakabi,John M. Dolan,Ozan K. Tonguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了更高容量的分割骨干网络对使用4D雷达生成LiDAR式点云质量的影响，发现最优分割骨干网络可以比现有技术提升23.7%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR成本高昂限制了高级自动驾驶系统的广泛采用，研究旨在通过使用4D雷达替代LiDAR来降低成本，同时保持感知性能。

Method: 使用更高容量的分割骨干网络来改进基于4D雷达的LiDAR式点云生成方法，对比不同容量模型对点云质量的影响。

Result: 研究发现过高容量的模型反而会损害性能，但最优分割骨干网络可以实现23.7%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 选择合适的模型容量对于基于雷达的点云生成至关重要，最优分割骨干网络能显著提升性能，为低成本自动驾驶感知提供了可行方案。

Abstract: LiDAR's dense, sharp point cloud (PC) representations of the surrounding
environment enable accurate perception and significantly improve road safety by
offering greater scene awareness and understanding. However, LiDAR's high cost
continues to restrict the broad adoption of high-level Autonomous Driving (AD)
systems in commercially available vehicles. Prior research has shown progress
towards circumventing the need for LiDAR by training a neural network, using
LiDAR point clouds as ground truth (GT), to produce LiDAR-like 3D point clouds
using only 4D Radars. One of the best examples is a neural network created to
train a more efficient radar target detector with a modular 2D convolutional
neural network (CNN) backbone and a temporal coherence network at its core that
uses the RaDelft dataset for training (see arXiv:2406.04723). In this work, we
investigate the impact of higher-capacity segmentation backbones on the quality
of the produced point clouds. Our results show that while very high-capacity
models may actually hurt performance, an optimal segmentation backbone can
provide a 23.7% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA).

*Aravind Narayanan,Vahid Reza Khazaie,Shaina Raza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新闻图像基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在视觉线索存在时吸收和复制有害社会刻板印象的风险。研究发现视觉上下文会系统性地影响模型输出，不同属性和模型的偏见程度不同，且更高的忠实度不一定对应更低的偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型能够联合解释图像和文本，但在存在年龄、性别、种族、服装或职业等视觉线索时，容易吸收和复制有害的社会刻板印象。为了调查这些风险，需要建立一个专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建了一个包含1,343个图像-问题对的新闻图像基准，标注了真实答案和人口统计属性。评估了多种最先进的视觉语言模型，并使用大型语言模型作为评判者，辅以人工验证。

Result: 研究发现：(i) 视觉上下文在开放设置中系统性地影响模型输出；(ii) 不同属性和模型的偏见程度不同，性别和职业的风险特别高；(iii) 更高的忠实度不一定对应更低的偏见。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了视觉语言模型在视觉线索存在时的偏见风险，并发布了基准测试、评估标准和代码，以支持可重复和关注公平性的多模态评估。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) can jointly interpret images and text,
but they are also prone to absorbing and reproducing harmful social stereotypes
when visual cues such as age, gender, race, clothing, or occupation are
present. To investigate these risks, we introduce a news-image benchmark
consisting of 1,343 image-question pairs drawn from diverse outlets, which we
annotated with ground-truth answers and demographic attributes (age, gender,
race, occupation, and sports). We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art VLMs and
employ a large language model (LLM) as judge, with human verification. Our
findings show that: (i) visual context systematically shifts model outputs in
open-ended settings; (ii) bias prevalence varies across attributes and models,
with particularly high risk for gender and occupation; and (iii) higher
faithfulness does not necessarily correspond to lower bias. We release the
benchmark prompts, evaluation rubric, and code to support reproducible and
fairness-aware multimodal assessment.

### [10] [MoTiC: Momentum Tightness and Contrast for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19664)
*Zeyu He,Shuai Huang,Yuwu Lu,Ming Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出MoTiC框架，通过贝叶斯分析将新类先验与旧类统计对齐，结合大规模对比学习和动量自监督，解决FSCIL中新类原型估计偏差问题，在三个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSCIL面临样本稀缺导致的新类原型估计偏差问题，而基类原型受益于充足数据。现有方法使用冻结特征提取器和类平均原型，但新类原型仍存在显著偏差。

Method: 提出MoTiC框架：1）贝叶斯分析对齐新类先验与旧类统计以减少方差；2）大规模对比学习增强跨类别特征紧密度；3）动量自监督和虚拟类别注入先验信息，丰富特征多样性。

Result: 在三个FSCIL基准测试中取得最先进性能，特别是在细粒度任务CUB-200上表现优异，验证了方法减少估计偏差和提升增量学习鲁棒性的能力。

Conclusion: MoTiC通过贝叶斯先验对齐和对比特征学习，有效解决了FSCIL中的原型估计偏差问题，构建了具有丰富表示和增强类间凝聚力的特征空间。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) must contend with the dual
challenge of learning new classes from scarce samples while preserving old
class knowledge. Existing methods use the frozen feature extractor and
class-averaged prototypes to mitigate against catastrophic forgetting and
overfitting. However, new-class prototypes suffer significant estimation bias
due to extreme data scarcity, whereas base-class prototypes benefit from
sufficient data. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that aligning the
new-class priors with old-class statistics via Bayesian analysis reduces
variance and improves prototype accuracy. Furthermore, we propose large-scale
contrastive learning to enforce cross-category feature tightness. To further
enrich feature diversity and inject prior information for new-class prototypes,
we integrate momentum self-supervision and virtual categories into the Momentum
Tightness and Contrast framework (MoTiC), constructing a feature space with
rich representations and enhanced interclass cohesion. Experiments on three
FSCIL benchmarks produce state-of-the-art performances, particularly on the
fine-grained task CUB-200, validating our method's ability to reduce estimation
bias and improve incremental learning robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究使用机器学习方法解决高分辨率遥感仪器中的云和云影检测问题，评估了传统方法和深度学习架构的性能，发现深度学习模型显著提高了检测质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效的云和云影检测是准确获取大气甲烷或其他痕量气体浓度的关键前提，尤其对MethaneSAT和MethaneAIR任务至关重要，因为这些干扰会偏置甲烷反演结果并影响排放量化。

Method: 部署并评估了传统技术（迭代逻辑回归ILR和多层感知器MLP）与先进深度学习架构（UNet和光谱通道注意力网络SCAN），比较它们在云和云影检测中的表现。

Result: 传统方法在空间一致性和边界定义方面存在困难，而深度学习模型显著改善检测质量：UNet在保持空间结构方面表现最佳，SCAN在捕捉精细边界细节方面更优，特别是在MethaneSAT数据上SCAN超越UNet。

Conclusion: 深入评估表明，先进的深度学习架构在提供稳健、可扩展的云和云影筛查解决方案方面具有优势，能够增强现有和下一代高光谱任务的甲烷排放量化能力。

Abstract: Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for
accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace
gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent
for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this
study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow
detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments.
Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened
out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the
quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques
including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel
Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods
struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the
detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially
improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure,
while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses
UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral
attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various
disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and
effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust,
scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing
methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation
hyperspectral missions. Our data and code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在特征图中存在结构化噪声伪影，这阻碍了分割和深度估计等下游应用

Method: 结构化令牌增强(STA)在令牌化过程中通过空间扰动增强令牌多样性，自适应噪声过滤(ANF)在Transformer层间应用可学习的在线去噪

Result: 在ImageNet、Ade20k和NYUv2等标准基准测试中，视觉质量和任务性能均得到一致改善

Conclusion: 所提出的方法具有架构无关性，在实际应用中表现出有效性

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated superior performance across a
wide range of computer vision tasks. However, structured noise artifacts in
their feature maps hinder downstream applications such as segmentation and
depth estimation. We propose two novel and lightweight optimisation techniques-
Structured Token Augmentation (STA) and Adaptive Noise Filtering (ANF)- to
improve interpretability and mitigate these artefacts. STA enhances token
diversity through spatial perturbations during tokenisation, while ANF applies
learnable inline denoising between transformer layers. These methods are
architecture-agnostic and evaluated across standard benchmarks, including
ImageNet, Ade20k, and NYUv2. Experimental results show consistent improvements
in visual quality and task performance, highlighting the practical
effectiveness of our approach.

*Ling Lo,Kelvin C. K. Chan,Wen-Huang Cheng,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过引入逐帧引导的方法来扩展现有模型，实现平滑一致的属性过渡，并创建了CAT-Bench基准和两个评估指标来全面评估模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理复杂时间变化时存在困难，特别是在生成具有渐变属性过渡的视频时，常见的提示插值方法往往无法处理渐变属性过渡，导致不一致性更加明显。

Method: 通过在去噪过程中引入逐帧引导，为每个噪声潜在空间构建数据特定的过渡方向，逐帧指导从初始属性到最终属性的渐变，同时保留视频的运动动态。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在现有基准上表现优异，实现了视觉保真度、与文本提示的对齐以及无缝的属性过渡。

Conclusion: 提出的方法简单有效，能够显著改善视频生成中的属性过渡质量，并提供了CAT-Bench基准和评估指标来推动该领域的研究。

Abstract: Existing models often struggle with complex temporal changes, particularly
when generating videos with gradual attribute transitions. The most common
prompt interpolation approach for motion transitions often fails to handle
gradual attribute transitions, where inconsistencies tend to become more
pronounced. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to extend
existing models for smooth and consistent attribute transitions, through
introducing frame-wise guidance during the denoising process. Our approach
constructs a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent,
guiding the gradual shift from initial to final attributes frame by frame while
preserving the motion dynamics of the video. Moreover, we present the
Controlled-Attribute-Transition Benchmark (CAT-Bench), which integrates both
attribute and motion dynamics, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of
different models. We further propose two metrics to assess the accuracy and
smoothness of attribute transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach performs favorably against existing baselines, achieving visual
fidelity, maintaining alignment with text prompts, and delivering seamless
attribute transitions. Code and CATBench are released:

Method: 提出解剖学约束的Transformer模型，将心肌区域嵌入为一组变形点和对应的图像块作为输入标记。同时将这种约束应用于自监督学习的掩码自编码器预训练，仅对解剖区域进行掩码和重建。

Result: 通过将Transformer和预训练任务限制在心肌区域，在心脏淀粉样变性分类任务上相比全视频Transformer获得了更高的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了分类性能，还提供了分类仅关注超声心动图解剖区域的明确保证，并能够可视化Transformer在变形心肌上的注意力分数。

Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a rare cardiomyopathy, with typical abnormalities
in clinical measurements from echocardiograms such as reduced global
longitudinal strain of the myocardium. An alternative approach for detecting CA
is via neural networks, using video classification models such as convolutional
neural networks. These models process entire video clips, but provide no
assurance that classification is based on clinically relevant features known to
be associated with CA. An alternative paradigm for disease classification is to
apply models to quantitative features such as strain, ensuring that the
classification relates to clinically relevant features. Drawing inspiration
from this approach, we explicitly constrain a transformer model to the
anatomical region where many known CA abnormalities occur -- the myocardium,
which we embed as a set of deforming points and corresponding sampled image
patches into input tokens. We show that our anatomical constraint can also be
applied to the popular self-supervised learning masked autoencoder
pre-training, where we propose to mask and reconstruct only anatomical patches.
We show that by constraining both the transformer and pre-training task to the
myocardium where CA imaging features are localized, we achieve increased
performance on a CA classification task compared to full video transformers.
Our model provides an explicit guarantee that the classification is focused on
only anatomical regions of the echo, and enables us to visualize transformer
attention scores over the deforming myocardium.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的方法，用于选择最优的超声心动图视频剪辑子集，以提高疾病分类性能并减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动疾病分类方法要么使用单一剪辑（忽略其他剪辑的补充信息），要么使用所有剪辑（计算成本高且不利于临床采用），需要一种平衡性能与效率的解决方案。

Method: 通过强化学习训练智能体，学习何时继续处理特定视图的剪辑以减少分类不确定性，或何时停止处理（当分类置信度足够时）。同时提出可学习的基于注意力的聚合方法来融合多剪辑信息。

Result: 在检测心脏淀粉样变性的任务中，仅使用30%的剪辑就获得了0.91的AUC，超过了使用所有剪辑和其他基准方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著减少计算资源的同时提高了疾病分类性能，展示了在临床环境中高效自动化分析的潜力。

Abstract: Guidelines for transthoracic echocardiographic examination recommend the
acquisition of multiple video clips from different views of the heart,
resulting in a large number of clips. Typically, automated methods, for
instance disease classifiers, either use one clip or average predictions from
all clips. Relying on one clip ignores complementary information available from
other clips, while using all clips is computationally expensive and may be
prohibitive for clinical adoption.
  To select the optimal subset of clips that maximize performance for a
specific task (image-based disease classification), we propose a method
optimized through reinforcement learning. In our method, an agent learns to
either keep processing view-specific clips to reduce the disease classification
uncertainty, or stop processing if the achieved classification confidence is
sufficient. Furthermore, we propose a learnable attention-based aggregation
method as a flexible way of fusing information from multiple clips. The
proposed method obtains an AUC of 0.91 on the task of detecting cardiac
amyloidosis using only 30% of all clips, exceeding the performance achieved
from using all clips and from other benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中上下文学习(ICL)对大规模多样化数据集的需求与数据稀缺性之间的矛盾，现有数据合成方法难以同时实现高数据多样性和适合医学数据的领域分布。

Method: 基于领域随机化的数据合成框架，利用真实数据集的解剖先验确保真实性，生成多样化解剖结构以覆盖广泛数据分布，并显式建模主体间变异以创建适合ICL的数据队列。

Result: 在四个保留数据集上的实验验证了框架有效性，使用SynthICL数据训练的模型在平均Dice指标上提升高达63%，并显著增强了对未见解剖领域的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SynthICL有助于缓解基于ICL的分割方法的数据瓶颈，为构建鲁棒模型铺平道路。

Abstract: The rise of In-Context Learning (ICL) for universal medical image
segmentation has introduced an unprecedented demand for large-scale, diverse
datasets for training, exacerbating the long-standing problem of data scarcity.
While data synthesis offers a promising solution, existing methods often fail
to simultaneously achieve both high data diversity and a domain distribution
suitable for medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{SynthICL}, a
novel data synthesis framework built upon domain randomization. SynthICL
ensures realism by leveraging anatomical priors from real-world datasets,
generates diverse anatomical structures to cover a broad data distribution, and
explicitly models inter-subject variations to create data cohorts suitable for
ICL. Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets validate our framework's
effectiveness, showing that models trained with our data achieve performance
gains of up to 63\% in average Dice and substantially enhanced generalization
to unseen anatomical domains. Our work helps mitigate the data bottleneck for
ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models. Our code and the
generated dataset are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种单目视觉惯性运动和深度（VIMD）学习框架，通过利用MSCKF-based单目视觉惯性运动跟踪来估计密集度量深度，核心创新是利用多视图信息迭代细化每个像素的尺度，而不是像先前工作那样全局拟合不变仿射模型。

Motivation: 准确高效的密集度量深度估计对于机器人和XR中的3D视觉感知至关重要，需要一种能够在资源受限环境中部署的实用解决方案。

Method: 开发了高度模块化的VIMD框架，兼容多种现有深度估计骨干网络，利用多视图信息迭代细化每个像素的尺度，即使每张图像只有10-20个稀疏度量深度点也能工作。

Result: 在TartanAir和VOID数据集上进行了广泛评估，并在AR Table数据集上展示了零样本泛化能力，结果显示VIMD实现了卓越的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VIMD是一个实用的解决方案，其鲁棒性能和强大泛化能力在各种场景中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual
perception in robotics and XR. In this paper, we develop a monocular
visual-inertial motion and depth (VIMD) learning framework to estimate dense
metric depth by leveraging accurate and efficient MSCKF-based monocular
visual-inertial motion tracking. At the core the proposed VIMD is to exploit
multi-view information to iteratively refine per-pixel scale, instead of
globally fitting an invariant affine model as in the prior work. The VIMD
framework is highly modular, making it compatible with a variety of existing
depth estimation backbones. We conduct extensive evaluations on the TartanAir
and VOID datasets and demonstrate its zero-shot generalization capabilities on
the AR Table dataset. Our results show that VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy
and robustness, even with extremely sparse points as few as 10-20 metric depth
points per image. This makes the proposed VIMD a practical solution for
deployment in resource constrained settings, while its robust performance and
strong generalization capabilities offer significant potential across a wide
range of scenarios.

Result: 在QaTa-COV19和MosMedData+数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量上都优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: FMISeg通过频域多模态交互有效提升了语言引导医学图像分割的性能

Abstract: Automatically segmenting infected areas in radiological images is essential
for diagnosing pulmonary infectious diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated
that the accuracy of the medical image segmentation can be improved by
incorporating clinical text reports as semantic guidance. However, the complex
morphological changes of lesions and the inherent semantic gap between
vision-language modalities prevent existing methods from effectively enhancing
the representation of visual features and eliminating semantically irrelevant
information, ultimately resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. To
address these problems, we propose a Frequency-domain Multi-modal Interaction
model (FMISeg) for language-guided medical image segmentation. FMISeg is a late
fusion model that establishes interaction between linguistic features and
frequency-domain visual features in the decoder. Specifically, to enhance the
visual representation, our method introduces a Frequency-domain Feature
Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) module to effectively fuse frequency-domain
features. Furthermore, a Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction
(LFFI) module is incorporated within the decoder to suppress semantically
irrelevant visual features under the guidance of linguistic information.
Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ demonstrated that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: PolGS方法通过引入偏振约束，在保持3D高斯泼溅快速渲染优势的同时，显著提升了复杂反射表面的重建质量，为实时虚拟现实应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient shape reconstruction for surfaces with complex reflectance
properties is crucial for real-time virtual reality. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS)-based methods offer fast novel view rendering by leveraging
their explicit surface representation, their reconstruction quality lags behind
that of implicit neural representations, particularly in the case of recovering
surfaces with complex reflective reflectance. To address these problems, we
propose PolGS, a Polarimetric Gaussian Splatting model allowing fast reflective
surface reconstruction in 10 minutes. By integrating polarimetric constraints
into the 3DGS framework, PolGS effectively separates specular and diffuse
components, enhancing reconstruction quality for challenging reflective
materials. Experimental results on the synthetic and real-world dataset
validate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型会盲目遵循所有用户指令，即使指令不可行或矛盾，导致输出无意义。需要一种能验证指令上下文一致性的方法。

Method: 提出CAMILA方法，通过上下文感知掩码和语言对齐技术，验证指令与图像的上下文一致性，只对指定区域应用相关编辑。

Result: 在包含不可行请求的单指令和多指令图像编辑数据集上评估，CAMILA在性能和语义对齐方面优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: CAMILA能有效处理复杂指令挑战，在保持图像完整性的同时实现更好的编辑效果。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has been allowing users to transform and synthesize
images through natural language instructions, offering considerable
flexibility. However, most existing image editing models naively attempt to
follow all user instructions, even if those instructions are inherently
infeasible or contradictory, often resulting in nonsensical output. To address
these challenges, we propose a context-aware method for image editing named as
CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment).
CAMILA is designed to validate the contextual coherence between instructions
and the image, ensuring that only relevant edits are applied to the designated
regions while ignoring non-executable instructions. For comprehensive
evaluation of this new method, we constructed datasets for both single- and
multi-instruction image editing, incorporating the presence of infeasible
requests. Our method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment
than state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling
complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.

Motivation: 现有的基于参数高效微调的RGB-T跟踪方法仅依赖空间域信息作为提示，忽略了频域信息在提示学习中的重要作用，导致性能未能达到最优。

Method: 使用共享参数的对称特征提取编码器、视觉傅里叶提示和模态融合提示生成器。首先提取RGB和热红外模态特征，然后将空间域视觉提示与FFT获得的频域提示结合，最后通过模态融合生成双向交互提示。

Result: 在三个主流RGB-T跟踪基准测试上的大量实验表明，该方法表现出卓越的性能。

Conclusion: VFPTrack方法通过有效利用频域信息实现了RGB-T跟踪的性能提升，证明了频域信息在双模态跟踪中的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking
as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based
RGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as
prompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal
performance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in
prompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier
Prompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature
extraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality
Fusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts
through multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature
extraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.
Then, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency
domain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and
understanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally,
unlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we
use combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality
prompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to
fully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive
experiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our
method demonstrates outstanding performance.

Conclusion: 通过建立标准化基准和严格评估协议，RD³为数据集蒸馏研究提供了公平可复现比较的基础。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to generate compact synthetic datasets that enable
models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to those trained on
full real datasets, while substantially reducing storage and computational
costs. Early bi-level optimization methods (e.g., MTT) have shown promising
results on small-scale datasets, but their scalability is limited by high
computational overhead. To address this limitation, recent decoupled dataset
distillation methods (e.g., SRe$^2$L) separate the teacher model pre-training
from the synthetic data generation process. These methods also introduce random
data augmentation and epoch-wise soft labels during the post-evaluation phase
to improve performance and generalization. However, existing decoupled
distillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which
hinders progress in the field. In this work, we propose Rectified Decoupled
Dataset Distillation (RD$^3$), and systematically investigate how different
post-evaluation settings affect test accuracy. We further examine whether the
reported performance differences across existing methods reflect true
methodological advances or stem from discrepancies in evaluation procedures.
Our analysis reveals that much of the performance variation can be attributed
to inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in the intrinsic quality of
the synthetic data. In addition, we identify general strategies that improve
the effectiveness of distilled datasets across settings. By establishing a
standardized benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol, RD$^3$ provides a
foundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation
research.

Conclusion: 该工作提出了可扩展的端到端学习策略，在不牺牲准确性的前提下显著降低医学图像分割的标注需求

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical
image segmentation, offering competitive performance while substantially
reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. When combined with active
learning (AL), these strategies further minimize annotation burden by
selectively incorporating the most informative samples. However, conventional
SSL_AL hybrid approaches often rely on iterative and loop-based retraining
cycles after each annotation round, incurring significant computational
overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications. In this study, we
present a novel, annotation-efficient, and self-adaptive deep segmentation
framework that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering
(FilterMatch), an AL-inspired mechanism, within the single-pass nnU-Net
training segmentation framework (nnFilterMatch). By selectively excluding
high-confidence pseudo-labels during training, our method circumvents the need
for retraining loops while preserving the benefits of uncertainty-guided
learning. We validate the proposed framework across multiple clinical
segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable
to or exceeding fully supervised models, even with only 5\%--20\% labeled data.
This work introduces a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing
annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

Result: 在MEAD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多个指标上优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 显式AU到地标建模对于表达性说话头生成是有效的。

Abstract: We propose a two-stage framework for audio-driven talking head generation
with fine-grained expression control via facial Action Units (AUs). Unlike
prior methods relying on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning, our model
explicitly maps AUs to 2D facial landmarks, enabling physically grounded,
per-frame expression control. In the first stage, a variational motion
generator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU
intensities. In the second stage, a diffusion-based synthesizer generates
realistic, lip-synced videos conditioned on these landmarks and a reference
image. This separation of motion and appearance improves expression accuracy,
temporal stability, and visual realism. Experiments on the MEAD dataset show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics,
demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit AU-to-landmark modeling for
expressive talking head generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于边界的softmax损失（如SphereFace、CosFace、ArcFace）忽略了噪声样本的影响。研究发现干净样本主要聚集在角度空间中心区域，而噪声样本倾向于向边缘区域偏移。

Method: 设计指数角度边界损失（ExpFace），在角度空间中引入指数项作为边界，中心区域施加较大惩罚，边缘区域施加较小惩罚，强调干净样本同时抑制噪声样本。

Result: ExpFace不仅避免了SphereFace的训练不稳定性和ArcFace的非单调性问题，而且在角度空间中表现出与决策边界一致的惩罚方式。大量实验表明ExpFace达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ExpFace通过角度指数边界设计有效处理噪声样本问题，在人脸识别任务中表现出优越性能，为未来研究提供了新的损失函数设计思路。

Abstract: Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power
to ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances.
Margin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have
been widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the
distribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples
predominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift
toward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the
Exponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular
exponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the
center region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular
space, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We
present a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses
in terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves,
showing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and
the non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that
applies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular
space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ExpFace achieves state-of-the-art
performance. To facilitate future research, we have released the source code

Conclusion: 该方法通过强化学习增强的端到端LVLM模型，显著提升了复杂文档解析能力，为文档分析领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Vision-Language models (LVLM) have spurred
significant progress in document parsing task. Compared to traditional
pipeline-based methods, end-to-end paradigms have shown their excellence in
converting PDF images into structured outputs through integrated Optical
Character Recognition (OCR), table recognition, mathematical formula
recognition and so on. However, the absence of explicit analytical stages for
document layouts and reading orders limits the LVLM's capability in handling
complex document types such as multi-column newspapers or posters. To address
this limitation, we propose in this report Logics-Parsing: an end-to-end
LVLM-based model augmented with reinforcement learning. Our model incorporates
meticulously designed reward mechanisms to optimize complex layout analysis and
reading order inference. In addition, we expand the model's versatility by
incorporating diverse data types such as chemical formulas and handwritten
Chinese characters into supervised fine-tuning. Finally, to enable rigorous
evaluation of our approach, we introduce LogicsParsingBench, a curated set of
1,078 page-level PDF images spanning nine major categories and over twenty

conducted on LogicsParsingBench have validated the efficacy and
State-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our proposed model across diverse

*Hartmut Häntze,Myrthe Buser,Alessa Hering,Lisa C. Adams,Keno K. Bressem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究发现Dice相似系数(DSC)等重叠度指标本身存在性别偏差，因为较小的器官即使出现相同程度的误差也会导致更低的DSC值，而女性器官通常较小，因此DSC会系统性地低估女性分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究关注模型或数据集的性别差异，但尚未有人研究DSC指标本身可能引入的偏差。由于器官大小存在性别差异，相同程度的分割误差在女性较小的器官上会产生更低的DSC值，这可能误导对模型公平性的评估。

Method: 在50名参与者的手动MRI标注上应用相同大小的合成误差，确保性别间的可比性。通过模拟不同大小的边界偏移来量化DSC的性别差异。

Result: 即使最小误差（如1mm边界偏移）也会产生系统性的DSC性别差异。小结构平均DSC差异约0.03，中等结构约0.01，只有大结构（如肺和肝）基本不受影响。

Conclusion: 使用DSC作为评估指标的公平性研究不应期望男女获得相同分数，因为指标本身存在偏差。识别这一因素对于医学图像分析中更准确和公平的评估至关重要。

Abstract: Overlap-based metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) penalize
segmentation errors more heavily in smaller structures. As organ size differs
by sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in
lower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.
While previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,
no study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.
This study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC
in an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied
equally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants
to ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary
shift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,
average DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around
0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,
with sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that
fairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect
identical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A
segmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error
magnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work
raises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences
in segmentation performance. One that arises not from model behavior, but from
the metric itself. Recognizing this factor is essential for more accurate and
fair evaluations in medical image analysis.

Result: 主要版本相比基线减少了约67%的FLOPS，在CPU上推理速度提升超过5倍，在边缘设备上提升2.5倍，同时保持了优异的图像质量。

Abstract: Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on
resource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision,
as its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent
surveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a
mainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally
face the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts,
hindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a
light-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR
reconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the
Context-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the
YCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then
employs an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress
ghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce
Inverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced
Multi-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at
multiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main
version for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in
computational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between
performance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared
to the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and
increases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge
device. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and
ghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and
practicality across various dynamic scenarios.

*Yixun Zhang,Feng Zhou,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiTAA是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的双任务对抗攻击方法，能够同时降低目标检测性能并偏置单目深度估计，揭示了自动驾驶多任务感知中的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D/3D攻击方法多为任务孤岛，缺乏可控深度偏置机制，且没有标准化协议来量化跨任务转移，导致检测与深度任务之间的交互关系未被充分探索。

Method: 基于3D高斯泼溅构建双模型攻击框架，支持全图像和补丁设置，兼容常见检测器和深度估计器；设计了复合损失函数，在感兴趣区域内耦合检测抑制与符号可控的对数深度偏置。

Result: 实验显示BiTAA能实现一致的跨任务性能下降，并揭示了从检测到深度和从深度到检测的明显不对称转移特性。

Conclusion: 该方法凸显了多任务相机感知的实际风险，为自动驾驶场景中的跨任务感知防御提供了动机。

Abstract: Camera-based perception is critical to autonomous driving yet remains
vulnerable to task-specific adversarial manipulations in object detection and
monocular depth estimation. Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task
silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no
standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction
between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task
adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single
perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing
monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that
supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common
detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation
(EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that
couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth
bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far
misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also
propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and
real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear
asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results
highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate
cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.

*Shantanusinh Parmar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StrCGAN是一种用于增强低分辨率天体摄影图像的生成模型，通过3D卷积层、多光谱融合和天体物理正则化模块来重建高保真度的天体图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小望远镜观测图像分辨率低、质量差的问题，传统CycleGAN模型仅限于2D映射且会扭曲恒星和星系的形态。

Method: 扩展CycleGAN框架，引入3D卷积层捕获体积空间相关性，多光谱融合对齐光学和近红外域，天体物理正则化模块保护恒星形态。

Result: StrCGAN生成的图像不仅视觉上更清晰，而且物理上更一致，在星体图像增强任务中优于标准GAN模型。

Conclusion: StrCGAN通过创新的3D卷积、多光谱融合和物理正则化技术，成功实现了高质量的天体图像重建，为低分辨率天文观测提供了有效的增强解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce StrCGAN (Stellar Cyclic GAN), a generative model designed to
enhance low-resolution astrophotography images. Our goal is to reconstruct
high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task
that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of
small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional
models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but
are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and
galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with
three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial
correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR)
domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar
morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning
optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain
consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to
generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically
consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical
image enhancement.

TL;DR: 提出了meta-weight-ensembler方法，通过元学习训练混合系数生成器来解决持续学习中的任务级和层级知识冲突问题，有效缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型集成方法在持续学习中存在任务级和层级的知识冲突问题，导致新旧任务的学习性能都受到影响。

Method: 使用元学习训练混合系数生成器，为每个层单独生成适当的混合系数进行模型集成，自适应地融合不同任务的知识。

Result: 在多个持续学习数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，并达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: meta-weight-ensembler可以灵活地与现有持续学习方法结合，提升其缓解灾难性遗忘的能力。

Abstract: Model ensemble is an effective strategy in continual learning, which
alleviates catastrophic forgetting by interpolating model parameters, achieving
knowledge fusion learned from different tasks. However, existing model ensemble
methods usually encounter the knowledge conflict issue at task and layer
levels, causing compromised learning performance in both old and new tasks. To
solve this issue, we propose meta-weight-ensembler that adaptively fuses
knowledge of different tasks for continual learning. Concretely, we employ a
mixing coefficient generator trained via meta-learning to generate appropriate
mixing coefficients for model ensemble to address the task-level knowledge
conflict. The mixing coefficient is individually generated for each layer to
address the layer-level knowledge conflict. In this way, we learn the prior
knowledge about adaptively accumulating knowledge of different tasks in a fused
model, achieving efficient learning in both old and new tasks.
Meta-weight-ensembler can be flexibly combined with existing continual learning
methods to boost their ability of alleviating catastrophic forgetting.
Experiments on multiple continual learning datasets show that
meta-weight-ensembler effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像的逼真度不断提高，引发了错误信息和隐私泄露的严重担忧，现有方法大多依赖二元分类或监督微调，泛化能力有限。

Method: 利用配备伪造推理提示的多模态大语言模型，采用群组相对策略优化的强化学习方法，设计结构化检测流程来提升推理质量和适应性。

Result: 在GenImage基准测试中超越最先进方法，在具有挑战性的LOKI基准测试中展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架在AI生成图像检测方面具有有效性和鲁棒性，代码将在论文被接受后发布。

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated images has raised serious concerns
about misinformation and privacy violations, highlighting the urgent need for
accurate and interpretable detection methods. While existing approaches have
made progress, most rely on binary classification without explanations or
depend heavily on supervised fine-tuning, resulting in limited generalization.
In this paper, we propose ThinkFake, a novel reasoning-based and generalizable
framework for AI-generated image detection. Our method leverages a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) equipped with a forgery reasoning prompt and is
trained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning
with carefully designed reward functions. This design enables the model to
perform step-by-step reasoning and produce interpretable, structured outputs.
We further introduce a structured detection pipeline to enhance reasoning
quality and adaptability. Extensive experiments show that ThinkFake outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on the GenImage benchmark and demonstrates strong
zero-shot generalization on the challenging LOKI benchmark. These results
validate our framework's effectiveness and robustness. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前具身AI在现实人类中心场景（如家庭环境）中部署困难，主要挑战在于难以建模个体人类偏好和行为。

Method: 构建包含2000多个高质量场景的基准测试，涵盖30多个HM3D数据集中的真实家庭环境，每个场景包含自然语言描述和物体-所有者关联信息。支持两种评估模式：未知环境中的主动导航和已映射场景中的物体定位。

Result: 实验显示现有最先进模型与人类表现存在显著差距，表明需要能够感知、推理和记忆个性化信息的具身智能体。

Abstract: Recent advances in Embodied AI have enabled agents to perform increasingly
complex tasks and adapt to diverse environments. However, deploying such agents
in realistic human-centered scenarios, such as domestic households, remains
challenging, particularly due to the difficulty of modeling individual human
preferences and behaviors. In this work, we introduce PersONAL (PERSonalized
Object Navigation And Localization, a comprehensive benchmark designed to study
personalization in Embodied AI. Agents must identify, retrieve, and navigate to
objects associated with specific users, responding to natural-language queries
such as "find Lily's backpack". PersONAL comprises over 2,000 high-quality
episodes across 30+ photorealistic homes from the HM3D dataset. Each episode
includes a natural-language scene description with explicit associations
between objects and their owners, requiring agents to reason over user-specific
semantics. The benchmark supports two evaluation modes: (1) active navigation
in unseen environments, and (2) object grounding in previously mapped scenes.
Experiments with state-of-the-art baselines reveal a substantial gap to human
performance, highlighting the need for embodied agents capable of perceiving,
reasoning, and memorizing over personalized information; paving the way towards
real-world assistive robot.

TL;DR: 本文提出FreezeVLA攻击框架，揭示了视觉-语言-动作模型的对抗性漏洞，能够通过对抗图像使模型"冻结"并忽略后续指令，在四个机器人基准测试中达到76.2%的平均攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在机器人技术中快速发展，但其安全性和对抗攻击的鲁棒性研究不足。研究发现对抗图像可以使VLA模型"冻结"，导致机器人无法响应关键干预指令，存在严重安全隐患。

Method: 提出FreezeVLA攻击框架，采用min-max双层优化方法生成和评估动作冻结攻击。在三个最先进的VLA模型和四个机器人基准上进行实验验证。

Result: FreezeVLA在四个基准测试中平均攻击成功率达到76.2%，显著优于现有方法。生成的对抗图像具有强迁移性，单个图像可跨不同语言提示可靠诱导瘫痪。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLA模型的关键安全风险，强调了开发鲁棒防御机制的紧迫性，为未来VLA模型的安全性研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are driving rapid progress in robotics by
enabling agents to interpret multimodal inputs and execute complex,
long-horizon tasks. However, their safety and robustness against adversarial
attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a
critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA
models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat
effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions,
potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically
study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that
generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level
optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic
benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%,
significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images
generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image
reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings
expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for
robust defense mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测方法在低光照、严重遮挡等复杂场景下因缺乏高层语义理解而导致性能下降

Method: 采用指令微调使MLLM生成结构化场景描述，设计自适应映射机制将语义信息动态转换为边缘检测器参数调整信号，在边缘-云协作框架中基于置信度自动选择调用云端语义引导或直接输出边缘检测结果

Result: 在低光照和高度遮挡场景中，延迟降低79%以上，计算成本降低70%，同时保持检测精度

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了复杂场景下的目标检测精度和效率，实现了语义增强与实时性能的良好平衡

Abstract: Traditional object detection methods face performance degradation challenges
in complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and heavy occlusions due to a
lack of high-level semantic understanding. To address this, this paper proposes
an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object
detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving
an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method
first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured
scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that
dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for
edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud
collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between
invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection
results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex
scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost
by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种专门针对360度球形或全向图像的超级像素方法SphSPS，通过考虑3D球形采集空间的几何特性来改进分割精度和形状规则性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超级像素方法主要针对标准2D平面图像设计，无法有效处理宽角度球形图像的几何失真问题，需要专门的方法来适应360度图像的几何特性。

Method: SphSPS方法基于球形最短路径，将像素与超级像素中心之间的最短路径概念推广到球形空间，快速提取相关聚类特征，并提出了球形空间的全局规则性度量。

Result: 在参考的360度球形全景分割数据集和合成道路全向图像上验证，SphSPS在分割精度、噪声鲁棒性和规则性方面显著优于现有平面和球形方法。

Conclusion: SphSPS为360度图像的超级像素应用提供了有效的工具，通过考虑采集空间几何特性实现了更好的分割性能。

Abstract: The growing use of wide angle image capture devices and the need for fast and
accurate image analysis in computer visions have enforced the need for
dedicated under-representation approaches. Most recent decomposition methods
segment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called
superpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment
standard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without
distortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called
SphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide
360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of
the 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path
between a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering
features. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space
to compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation
accuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity
aspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space,
addressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure.
Finally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o
spherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional
images. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to
noise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based
applications on 360o images.

Motivation: 现有自监督和对比学习方法需要大规模模型和大量精心整理的数据，但仍然难以处理细胞图像中的批次效应问题。

Method: 提出Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN)，通过跨孔对齐相同扰动下细胞的嵌入表示，在掩码孪生架构中强制语义一致性。

Result: 在基因-基因关系检索基准测试中，CWA-MSN比最先进的自监督方法(OpenPhenom)和对比学习方法(CellCLIP)分别提升29%和9%，同时使用更少数据(0.2M vs 2.2M图像)和更小模型(22M vs 1.48B参数)。

Conclusion: CWA-MSN是一种简单有效的细胞图像表示学习方法，能够在有限数据和参数预算下实现高效的表型建模。

Abstract: Computational models that predict cellular phenotypic responses to chemical
and genetic perturbations can accelerate drug discovery by prioritizing
therapeutic hypotheses and reducing costly wet-lab iteration. However,
extracting biologically meaningful and batch-robust cell painting
representations remains challenging. Conventional self-supervised and
contrastive learning approaches often require a large-scale model and/or a huge
amount of carefully curated data, still struggling with batch effects. We
present Cross-Well Aligned Masked Siamese Network (CWA-MSN), a novel
representation learning framework that aligns embeddings of cells subjected to
the same perturbation across different wells, enforcing semantic consistency
despite batch effects. Integrated into a masked siamese architecture, this
alignment yields features that capture fine-grained morphology while remaining
data- and parameter-efficient. For instance, in a gene-gene relationship
retrieval benchmark, CWA-MSN outperforms the state-of-the-art publicly
available self-supervised (OpenPhenom) and contrastive learning (CellCLIP)
methods, improving the benchmark scores by +29\% and +9\%, respectively, while
training on substantially fewer data (e.g., 0.2M images for CWA-MSN vs. 2.2M
images for OpenPhenom) or smaller model size (e.g., 22M parameters for CWA-MSN
vs. 1.48B parameters for CellCLIP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CWA-MSN is a simple and effective way to learn cell image representation,
enabling efficient phenotype modeling even under limited data and parameter
budgets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂场景的3D建模中，航空和地面图像的融合受到可靠对应点查找的限制，需要解决大视角变化带来的透视畸变问题。

Method: 首先使用航空图像通过增量式SfM重建稀疏模型，然后采用3D高斯泼溅进行场景渲染，设计渲染视点确定算法生成高质量中间图像，最后通过中间图像进行可靠的特征匹配。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能显著增加初始和精炼匹配点的数量，为航空和地面图像提供可靠的特征匹配，实现精确的ISfM重建和完整的3DGS场景渲染。

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案通过中间视图生成有效缓解了视角变化问题，为航空和地面图像的3D建模提供了可靠的匹配方法。

Abstract: The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in
3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding
reliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature
matching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate
intermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive
viewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are
reconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to
their large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for
scene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For
accurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed
by using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate
high-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and
ground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature
matching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground
images, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences
through intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the
validation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature
matching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used
methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can
provide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious
increase in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide
enough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based
scene rendering.

Motivation: 现有3DGS修复方法依赖2D视角的扩散或GAN模型来预测缺失区域的有限外观或深度线索，存在空间时间一致性问题和重训练耗时的问题。本文旨在直接在3DGS模态上实现替代性场景修复。

Method: 构建特征嵌入的3DGS场景，采用补丁测量方法在不同尺度上抽象局部上下文，提出结构搜索方法在3D空间中有效找到候选补丁，最后进行简单有效的替代融合优化以实现视觉和谐。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在驾驶场景中具有高效性和有效性，在质量和互操作性方面达到最先进性能。在一般场景中的额外实验也验证了该3D修复策略的适用性。

Conclusion: GS-RoadPatching通过利用驾驶场景中高度重复模式在隐式3DGS特征空间中的多模态相似性，实现了有效的3DGS替代修复，摆脱了对2D跨模态一致性的依赖，无需耗时重训练。

Abstract: This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene
completion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are
represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting
methods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based
diffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing
regions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing
directly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring
spatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for
time-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly
repetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities
within the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for
structural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting.
Practically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch
measurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and,
subsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in
3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective
substitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct
extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and
the results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability.
Additional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of
the proposed 3D inpainting strategy. The project page and code are available

Abstract: We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by
decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation
paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and
the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that
these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in
CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret
each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that
only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to
the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic,
represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these
observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free
semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second,
we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset
distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual
computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that
such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了视频投诉描述（CoD-V）新任务，通过视频帮助用户更清晰地表达产品投诉，并发布了ComVID数据集和基于VideoLLaMA2-7b的多模态RAG模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有投诉挖掘研究主要关注文本，但用户难以用文字清晰表达投诉内容，却能轻松上传展示产品缺陷的视频。需要帮助用户通过视频更好地表达投诉。

Method: 构建包含1,175个投诉视频的ComVID数据集，提出投诉保留（CR）评估指标，开发基于VideoLLaMA2-7b的多模态检索增强生成模型，考虑用户情绪状态。

Result: 对多个视频语言模型进行全面评估，使用METEOR、困惑度、Coleman-Liau可读性分数等指标验证模型性能。

Conclusion: 为通过视频表达投诉的新研究方向奠定了基础，数据集和资源已开源。

Abstract: While there exists a lot of work on explainable complaint mining,
articulating user concerns through text or video remains a significant
challenge, often leaving issues unresolved. Users frequently struggle to
express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting
product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a
5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper
formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users'
need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from
Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the
defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint
dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions,
also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we
present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the
proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description
tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to
generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct
a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks
(pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation
metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score,
among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to
provide a platform for users to express complaints through video. Dataset and
resources are available at: https://github.com/sarmistha-D/CoD-V.

### [43] [SynchroRaMa : Lip-Synchronized and Emotion-Aware Talking Face Generation via Multi-Modal Emotion Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19965)
*Phyo Thet Yee,Dimitrios Kollias,Sudeepta Mishra,Abhinav Dhall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynchroRaMa是一个多模态情感嵌入框架，通过结合文本和音频的情感信号，生成具有丰富情感表现力的说话人脸视频，解决了现有方法在情感捕捉和动态变化方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感感知方法主要依赖单一模态（音频或图像）进行情感嵌入，难以捕捉细微的情感线索；同时大多数方法仅基于单张参考图像，无法有效表示随时间变化的动作或属性动态。

Method: 提出SynchroRaMa框架：1）多模态情感嵌入（文本情感分析+语音情感识别+音频效价-唤醒特征）；2）音频到运动模块确保自然头部运动和准确唇部同步；3）引入LLM生成的场景描述作为额外文本输入，增强时间一致性和视觉真实感。

Result: 在基准数据集上的定量和定性实验表明，SynchroRaMa在图像质量、表情保持和运动真实感方面优于现有最优方法。用户研究进一步证实其在整体自然度、运动多样性和视频流畅度方面获得更高主观评分。

Conclusion: SynchroRaMa通过多模态情感嵌入和动态场景描述，显著提升了说话人脸生成的情感表现力和视觉真实感，为需要表达性人机交互的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest,
particularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar
interaction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single
modality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability
to capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a
single reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic
changes in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we
introduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion
embedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and
audio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal
features), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more
authentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion
and accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M)
module that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally,
SynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model
(LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and
high-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and
textual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa
outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality,
expression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that
SynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in
overall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness. Our project page

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OmniScene框架，通过视觉语言模型和多模态融合实现类人的4D场景理解，在自动驾驶中超越传统深度重建方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统缺乏真正的场景理解能力，主要依赖基于深度的3D重建而非类人的三维场景认知

Method: 提出OmniVLM视觉语言框架整合多视角和时间感知，采用师生架构和知识蒸馏嵌入文本表示到3D实例特征，并提出分层融合策略平衡几何和语义特征

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上全面评估，在感知、预测、规划和视觉问答等任务中超越十余种最先进模型，建立新基准

Conclusion: OmniScene框架通过语义监督和注意力机制实现了更类人的感知-理解-行动架构，为自动驾驶系统提供了更全面的场景理解能力

Abstract: Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an
egocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability
to translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability,
however, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where
mainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather
than true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
human-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene
Vision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates
multi-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then,
harnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation,
we embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic
supervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like
attentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with
human driving behaviors, forming a more human-like
perception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a
Hierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality
contributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates
the relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple
abstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from
visual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more
nuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information. We evaluate
OmniScene comprehensively on the nuScenes dataset, benchmarking it against over
ten state-of-the-art models across various tasks. Our approach consistently
achieves superior results, establishing new benchmarks in perception,
prediction, planning, and visual question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注透视投影视频的相机控制，而几何一致的全景视频生成仍然具有挑战性，主要由于全景姿态表示和球面投影的固有复杂性。

Method: 提出了全景Plücker嵌入来通过球坐标变换编码相机外参，并引入球面极线模块通过沿极线的自适应注意力掩码来增强几何约束。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法能生成与相机轨迹一致的高质量全景视频，在全景视频生成方面远超现有方法。

Conclusion: CamPVG框架通过创新的姿态编码和特征聚合机制，成功实现了几何一致的全景视频生成，为全景视频控制开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recently, camera-controlled video generation has seen rapid development,
offering more precise control over video generation. However, existing methods
predominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video
generation, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains
challenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in
panoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue,
we propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video
generation guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding
for panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical
projection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl\"ucker embedding that
encodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate
transformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry,
overcoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to
equirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar
module that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking
along epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature
aggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated
panoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates
high-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far
surpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沙田柚检测对于定位、自动化机器人采摘和成熟度分析至关重要，但在复杂果园环境中面临多尺度问题、树干和叶子遮挡、小目标检测等挑战。

Method: 构建了STP-AgriData数据集，提出SDE-DET模型：使用Star Block获取高维信息而不增加计算开销；在骨干网络中采用Deformable Attention增强遮挡条件下的检测能力；集成多个Efficient Multi-Scale Attention机制降低计算开销并提取深度视觉表征。

Result: SDE-DET在Precision、Recall、mAP@0.5、mAP@0.5:0.95和F1-score上分别达到0.883、0.771、0.838、0.497和0.823，在STP-AgriData数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SDE-DET为沙田柚检测提供了可靠方法，为自动采摘机器人的进一步发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Pomelo detection is an essential process for their localization, automated
robotic harvesting, and maturity analysis. However, detecting Shatian pomelo in
complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including
multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object
detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset
STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection.
SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional
information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the
presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its
ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple
Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to
reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations,
thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment,
we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models
in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of
0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5,
mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET
provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation
for the further development of automatic harvest robots.

*Zhifang Zhang,Jiahan Zhang,Shengjie Zhou,Qi Wei,Shuo He,Feng Liu,Lei Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为代理目标攻击（PTA）的新方法，用于解决多模态预训练模型中现有目标对抗攻击在泛化性和不可检测性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态预训练模型（如ImageBind）在跨模态对齐任务中面临安全威胁，特别是目标对抗攻击。当前攻击方法存在两个主要问题：1）对部分已知或语义相似目标的泛化能力有限；2）容易被简单的异常检测方法检测到。

Method: 提出PTA方法，利用多个源模态和目标模态代理来优化目标对抗样本，确保其在保持对防御规避的同时与多个潜在目标对齐。同时提供理论分析，阐明泛化性与不可检测性之间的关系。

Result: 实验结果表明，PTA能够在各种相关目标上实现高成功率，并且对多种异常检测方法保持不可检测性。

Conclusion: PTA方法有效解决了多模态预训练模型中目标对抗攻击的泛化性和不可检测性问题，为模型安全性提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Multimodal pre-trained models (e.g., ImageBind), which align distinct data
modalities into a shared embedding space, have shown remarkable success across
downstream tasks. However, their increasing adoption raises serious security
concerns, especially regarding targeted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
show that existing targeted adversarial attacks on multimodal pre-trained
models still have limitations in two aspects: generalizability and
undetectability. Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs)
exhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar
targets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can
be easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited
undetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method
called Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and
target-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to
defenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide
theoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and
undetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the
specified requirements for undetectability. Furthermore, experimental results
demonstrate that our PTA can achieve a high success rate across various related
targets and remain undetectable against multiple anomaly detection methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于内存库的异常检测方法在小数据集上有效，但在大规模医学数据集上计算负担过重，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用DINOv2预训练模型提取特征嵌入，采用Dirichlet过程混合模型建模正常样本分布，通过嵌入与聚类中心的相似度计算异常分数。

Result: 实验表明该方法在医学图像异常检测基准上达到有竞争力的性能，同时推理时间至少减半，且归一化DINOv2嵌入能更好地对齐解剖结构。

Conclusion: DINOv2嵌入结合DPMM为医学图像异常检测提供了高效且有效的解决方案，即使模型在自然图像上训练也能很好适应医学领域。

Abstract: In this work, we leverage informative embeddings from foundational models for
unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. For small datasets, a
memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection
which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large
medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially.
Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings
with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model
that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at
hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the
component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a
coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM
embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very
competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can
do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis
further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned
with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of
anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection. The code is
available at https://github.com/NicoSchulthess/anomalydino-dpmm.

Motivation: 机器学习中高效数据标注是重要挑战，特别是在需要大量标注数据的物体检测任务中。主动学习通过选择最有信息量的样本来最小化标注成本。

Method: 结合不确定性选择和多样性策略的主动学习方法，在表格检测任务中评估，使用CascadeTabNet和YOLOv9架构，在TableBank-LaTeX和TableBank-Word数据集上进行测试。

Result: 主动学习样本选择显著优于随机采样，在相同标注预算下获得更高的mAP分数，同时保持与全监督模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少了标注工作量，在有限预算下实现了高效的表格检测模型训练。

Abstract: Efficient data annotation remains a critical challenge in machine learning,
particularly for object detection tasks requiring extensive labeled data.
Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL
approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances
suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling
efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of
representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our
method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using
state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our
results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms
random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while
maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models. Our method
achieves higher mAP scores within the same annotation budget.

Motivation: 现有图像篡改定位方法采用一次性预测范式，忽略了篡改过程的序列性和层次性特征，导致维度崩溃和任务本质不匹配的问题。

Method: RITA框架将篡改定位建模为条件序列预测任务，逐层有序预测篡改区域，使用每一步的预测作为下一步的条件，显式建模编辑操作间的时序依赖和层次结构。

Result: 在传统基准测试中达到最先进水平，并为新的分层定位任务提供了坚实基础，验证了其作为通用有效范式的潜力。

Conclusion: RITA通过序列预测方法有效解决了图像篡改定位中的维度崩溃问题，为理解复杂篡改过程提供了新视角。

Abstract: Image manipulations often entail a complex manipulation process, comprising a
series of editing operations to create a deceptive image, exhibiting
sequentiality and hierarchical characteristics. However, existing IML methods
remain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in
a one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps.
This one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into
a single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a
fundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.
  To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation
localization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA
framework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered
manner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby
explicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among
editing operations.
  To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data
and construct a new benchmark HSIM. We further propose the HSS metric to assess
sequential order and hierarchical alignment. Extensive experiments show RITA
achieves SOTA on traditional benchmarks and provides a solid foundation for the
novel hierarchical localization task, validating its potential as a general and
effective paradigm. The code and dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: 当前多模态融合方法主要整合全切片图像和基因组数据，但忽略了病理报告这一重要临床信息。病理报告包含专家解读和临床背景，能够补充其他模态信息，提升预后预测性能。

Method: 提出原型生成方法：1）病理报告诊断原型，使用自注意力提取诊断相关部分；2）组织学原型，紧凑表示WSI关键形态模式；3）生物通路原型，编码转录组表达。然后使用三模态Transformer模型PS3处理原型token，建模模态内和跨模态交互。

Conclusion: 病理报告的引入显著提升了生存预测性能，原型生成方法有效解决了多模态异质性和不平衡问题，为计算肿瘤学提供了更全面的多模态融合框架。

Abstract: Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily
focus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with
genomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We
hypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic
performance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows,
offer readily available complementary information by summarizing
histopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical
context. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their
heterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several
billion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of
varying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we
propose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which
are then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival
prediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities).
Specifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports,
leveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and
standardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly
represent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway
prototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular
functions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting
prototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal
interactions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data. The
proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods when evaluated against
clinical, unimodal and multimodal baselines on six datasets from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA). The code is available at: https://github.com/manahilr/PS3.

Motivation: 传统生物认证系统存在用户无法控制数据使用方式、数据可能泄露被滥用的隐私问题

Method: 使用生成对抗网络将人脸图像转换到视觉私有域，然后在私有域图像上训练分类器进行认证

Result: 该方法对攻击具有鲁棒性，同时保持了有意义的实用性

Conclusion: 基于GAN的视觉私有域转换是一种有效的隐私保护认证方法

Abstract: Biometric-based authentication systems are getting broadly adopted in many
areas. However, these systems do not allow participating users to influence the
way their data is used. Furthermore, the data may leak and can be misused
without the users' knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new authentication
method that preserves the privacy of individuals and is based on a generative
adversarial network (GAN). Concretely, we suggest using the GAN for translating
images of faces to a visually private domain (e.g., flowers or shoes).
Classifiers, which are used for authentication purposes, are then trained on
the images from the visually private domain. Based on our experiments, the
method is robust against attacks and still provides meaningful utility.

Conclusion: 对于物理制造引起的域偏移，冻结的通用骨干网络比完全微调更鲁棒，后者可能过度拟合源域特征。

Abstract: The reliability of secure graphic verification, a key anti-counterfeiting
tool, is undermined by poor image acquisition on smartphones. Uncontrolled user
captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates,
creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from
traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively
estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a
lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its
suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated
using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of
32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis
on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a
lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better
to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a
key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical
manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full
fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.

Motivation: 当前编码器-解码器架构在可变形图像配准中缺乏专门的特征提取能力，且在所有三个方向上均匀预测变形场，存在性能限制。

Method: 在编码器层引入混合注意力头机制，为每个图像标记动态选择最优注意力头组合；在解码器层引入空间异构专家混合机制，使用不同核大小的专家为每个体素异质性预测三个方向的变形场。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验显示，该方法相比现有方法有显著提升，腹部CT数据集的Dice分数从60.58%提高到65.58%。

Conclusion: SHMoAReg首次将专家混合机制引入可变形图像配准任务，不仅提升了配准性能，还增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Encoder-Decoder architectures are widely used in deep learning-based
Deformable Image Registration (DIR), where the encoder extracts multi-scale
features and the decoder predicts deformation fields by recovering spatial
locations. However, current methods lack specialized extraction of features
(that are useful for registration) and predict deformation jointly and
homogeneously in all three directions. In this paper, we propose a novel
expert-guided DIR network with Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism applied in
both encoder and decoder, named SHMoAReg. Specifically, we incorporate Mixture
of Attention heads (MoA) into encoder layers, while Spatial Heterogeneous
Mixture of Experts (SHMoE) into the decoder layers. The MoA enhances the
specialization of feature extraction by dynamically selecting the optimal
combination of attention heads for each image token. Meanwhile, the SHMoE
predicts deformation fields heterogeneously in three directions for each voxel
using experts with varying kernel sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on two
publicly available datasets show consistent improvements over various methods,
with a notable increase from 60.58% to 65.58% in Dice score for the abdominal
CT dataset. Furthermore, SHMoAReg enhances model interpretability by
differentiating experts' utilities across/within different resolution layers.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce MoE mechanism into
DIR tasks. The code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像去雾中表现出色，但存在计算负担大和推理步骤多的问题，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 探索雾图在预训练扩散模型语义潜在空间中的特性，将不同时间步的扩散潜在表示集成到精心设计的去雾网络中。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有的图像去雾方法。

Conclusion: DiffLI²D为将扩散模型引入图像去雾提供了新视角，有效利用预训练模型的信息表示，避免了重新训练和迭代采样。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been investigated as powerful generative
solvers for image dehazing, owing to their remarkable capability to model the
data distribution. However, the massive computational burden imposed by the
retraining of diffusion models, coupled with the extensive sampling steps
during the inference, limit the broader application of diffusion models in
image dehazing. To address these issues, we explore the properties of hazy
images in the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, and
propose a Diffusion Latent Inspired network for Image Dehazing, dubbed
DiffLI$^2$D. Specifically, we first reveal that the semantic latent space of
pre-trained diffusion models can represent the content and haze characteristics
of hazy images, as the diffusion time-step changes. Building upon this insight,
we integrate the diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into
a delicately designed dehazing network to provide instructions for image
dehazing. Our DiffLI$^2$D avoids re-training diffusion models and iterative
sampling process by effectively utilizing the informative representations
derived from the pre-trained diffusion models, which also offers a novel
perspective for introducing diffusion models to image dehazing. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior performance to existing image dehazing methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该高光谱适配器架构能够有效利用预训练视觉基础模型处理高光谱数据，在复杂环境中展现出优越的语义分割能力

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense
spectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich
spectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception,
particularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying
illumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI
semantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on
architectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work,
we propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision
foundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our
architecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial
prior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we
introduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective
integration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer
features through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive
evaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our
architecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while
directly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral
segmentation methods. We make the code available at

TL;DR: 为了解决科学视觉问答中复杂图表和多模态上下文带来的挑战，研究者提出将图像和文本内容嵌入到单一图像中的新范式，并通过合成数据集来缓解训练数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学视觉问答对视觉语言模型具有挑战性，传统方法将图表和文本作为独立输入处理效果不佳。EXAMS-V引入了将视觉和文本内容嵌入单一图像的新范式，但即使在零样本设置下，最先进的专有模型表现仍然较差，需要任务特定的微调。

Method: 为了解决"文本在图像中"格式训练数据的稀缺性，研究者通过将现有的独立图像-文本对转换为统一图像来合成新的数据集。在一个小型多语言多模态模型上，使用合成数据和EXAMS-V的混合数据进行微调。

Result: 在13种语言上取得了显著提升，展示了强大的平均改进和跨语言迁移能力。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据集和混合训练的方法，有效提升了科学视觉问答任务的性能，特别是在多语言场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Scientific visual question answering poses significant challenges for
vision-language models due to the complexity of scientific figures and their
multimodal context. Traditional approaches treat the figure and accompanying
text (e.g., questions and answer options) as separate inputs. EXAMS-V
introduced a new paradigm by embedding both visual and textual content into a
single image. However, even state-of-the-art proprietary models perform poorly
on this setup in zero-shot settings, underscoring the need for task-specific
fine-tuning. To address the scarcity of training data in this "text-in-image"
format, we synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text
pairs into unified images. Fine-tuning a small multilingual multimodal model on
a mix of our synthetic data and EXAMS-V yields notable gains across 13
languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and cross-lingual
transfer.

TL;DR: EchoBench是一个评估医疗大视觉语言模型中谄媚行为的基准，发现现有模型在高风险临床环境中普遍存在严重谄媚问题，即使准确率较高的模型也不例外。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗LVLM基准过于关注准确率排行榜，忽视了模型的可靠性和安全性，特别是在高风险临床环境中模型可能不加批判地回应用户提供的有偏见信息。

Method: 开发EchoBench基准，包含2,122张图像覆盖18个科室和20种模态，使用90个模拟患者、医学生和医生有偏见输入的提示，评估医疗专用、开源和专有LVLM的谄媚行为。

Result: 所有模型都表现出显著谄媚行为，最好的专有模型谄媚率达45.98%，GPT-4.1达59.15%，许多医疗专用模型谄媚率超过95%。通过偏差类型、科室、感知粒度和模态的细粒度分析识别了增加易感性的因素。

Conclusion: 研究强调了超越准确率的鲁棒评估需求，提供了构建更安全、更可信医疗LVLM的可操作指导，包括数据质量/多样性提升和领域知识增强等缓解策略。

Abstract: Recent benchmarks for medical Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) emphasize
leaderboard accuracy, overlooking reliability and safety. We study sycophancy
-- models' tendency to uncritically echo user-provided information -- in
high-stakes clinical settings. We introduce EchoBench, a benchmark to
systematically evaluate sycophancy in medical LVLMs. It contains 2,122 images
across 18 departments and 20 modalities with 90 prompts that simulate biased
inputs from patients, medical students, and physicians. We evaluate
medical-specific, open-source, and proprietary LVLMs. All exhibit substantial
sycophancy; the best proprietary model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) still shows 45.98%
sycophancy, and GPT-4.1 reaches 59.15%. Many medical-specific models exceed 95%
sycophancy despite only moderate accuracy. Fine-grained analyses by bias type,
department, perceptual granularity, and modality identify factors that increase
susceptibility. We further show that higher data quality/diversity and stronger
domain knowledge reduce sycophancy without harming unbiased accuracy. EchoBench
also serves as a testbed for mitigation: simple prompt-level interventions
(negative prompting, one-shot, few-shot) produce consistent reductions and
motivate training- and decoding-time strategies. Our findings highlight the
need for robust evaluation beyond accuracy and provide actionable guidance
toward safer, more trustworthy medical LVLMs.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆依赖AI系统，透明度和安全性至关重要。后验解释为黑盒AI模型提供透明度，但其质量和可靠性常因不一致性和缺乏忠实性而受到质疑。

Method: 通过广泛的实证评估，比较自然训练、对抗训练和剪枝三种训练方法对交通标志分类器后验解释（使用显著性图）质量的影响。

Result: 剪枝显著增强了解释的可理解性和忠实度，不仅提高了模型效率，还强制学习表示的稀疏性，导致更可解释和可靠的决策。

Conclusion: 剪枝是开发透明深度学习模型的有前景策略，特别适用于资源受限的车载AI系统。

Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles continue to heavily rely on AI systems,
where transparency and security are critical for trust and operational safety.
Post-hoc explanations provide transparency to these black-box like AI models
but the quality and reliability of these explanations is often questioned due
to inconsistencies and lack of faithfulness in representing model decisions.
This paper systematically examines the impact of three widely used training
approaches, namely natural training, adversarial training, and pruning, affect
the quality of post-hoc explanations for traffic sign classifiers. Through
extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that pruning significantly
enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations (using saliency
maps). Our findings reveal that pruning not only improves model efficiency but
also enforces sparsity in learned representation, leading to more interpretable
and reliable decisions. Additionally, these insights suggest that pruning is a
promising strategy for developing transparent deep learning models, especially
in resource-constrained vehicular AI systems.

Conclusion: C²MIL通过同时优化语义和拓扑因果性，有效解决了WSI生存分析中的偏差问题，为图基MIL提供了因果增强框架

Abstract: Graph-based Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in survival
analysis with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs)
due to its ability to capture topological information. However, variations in
staining and scanning can introduce semantic bias, while topological subgraphs
that are not relevant to the causal relationships can create noise, resulting
in biased slide-level representations. These issues can hinder both the
interpretability and generalization of the analysis. To tackle this, we
introduce a dual structural causal model as the theoretical foundation and
propose a novel and interpretable dual causal graph-based MIL model, C$^2$MIL.
C$^2$MIL incorporates a novel cross-scale adaptive feature disentangling module
for semantic causal intervention and a new Bernoulli differentiable causal
subgraph sampling method for topological causal discovery. A joint optimization
strategy combining disentangling supervision and contrastive learning enables
simultaneous refinement of both semantic and topological causalities.
Experiments demonstrate that C$^2$MIL consistently improves generalization and
interpretability over existing methods and can serve as a causal enhancement
for diverse MIL baselines. The code is available at

Motivation: CBCT图像中牙齿和牙髓的准确分割对临床治疗规划和诊断至关重要，但传统方法需要专业知识和大量时间，迫切需要能有效利用未标记数据的自动化算法。

Method: 基于U-Mamba2模型构建半监督学习框架，采用多阶段训练策略：自监督预训练使用破坏性自编码器；通过输入和特征扰动进行一致性正则化；实施带减少损失权重的伪标签策略。

Result: 在验证数据集上获得0.872平均分和0.969 DSC，表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: U-Mamba2-SSL框架能有效利用未标记数据，在CBCT牙齿分割任务中取得优异结果，为临床应用提供了高效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of teeth and pulp in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography
(CBCT) is vital for clinical applications like treatment planning and
diagnosis. However, this process requires extensive expertise and is
exceptionally time-consuming, highlighting the critical need for automated
algorithms that can effectively utilize unlabeled data. In this paper, we
propose U-Mamba2-SSL, a novel semi-supervised learning framework that builds on
the U-Mamba2 model and employs a multi-stage training strategy. The framework
first pre-trains U-Mamba2 in a self-supervised manner using a disruptive
autoencoder. It then leverages unlabeled data through consistency
regularization, where we introduce input and feature perturbations to ensure
stable model outputs. Finally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is implemented with a
reduced loss weighting to minimize the impact of potential errors. U-Mamba2-SSL
achieved an average score of 0.872 and a DSC of 0.969 on the validation
dataset, demonstrating the superior performance of our approach. The code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了"光学海洋配方"框架，用于在受控水下环境中创建真实数据集，解决水下机器视觉评估缺乏可控测试环境的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下机器视觉开发面临挑战，主要因为缺乏能够模拟真实光学条件（如颜色失真、散射效应等）的受控测试环境，且现有评估往往缺乏普适性。

Method: 通过使用校准的颜色和散射添加剂，创建可重复的受控水下条件，生成真实但可控的数据集。

Result: 开发了一个演示数据集，并展示了该系统在水下视觉任务中的应用，包括水参数估计、图像恢复等。

Conclusion: 光学海洋配方为水下机器视觉提供了一个独特的测试框架，能够在真实但受控的条件下进行可重复评估。

Abstract: The development and evaluation of machine vision in underwater environments
remains challenging, often relying on trial-and-error-based testing tailored to
specific applications. This is partly due to the lack of controlled,
ground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges,
such as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced
contrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light
patterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance
of ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and
seasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific
optical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack
generalizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is
technically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \textit{Optical
Ocean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled
underwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes,
using calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and
controlled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance.
Hence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in
realistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment
enables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks,
including water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual
SLAM, and underwater image synthesis. We provide a demonstration dataset
generated using the Optical Ocean Recipes and briefly demonstrate the use of
our system for two underwater vision tasks. The dataset and evaluation code
will be made available.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对视觉语言建模自动驾驶系统的通用伪装攻击框架，通过在特征空间操作生成物理可实现的伪装纹理，显著提升了攻击效果和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法存在局限性：物理攻击主要针对视觉模块难以直接迁移到VLM-AD系统，而针对VLM-AD的攻击多集中在数字层面。需要开发能够物理实现且具有强泛化能力的攻击方法。

Method: UCA框架在特征空间操作，引入特征差异损失最大化干净图像和对抗图像的表征差异，采用多尺度学习策略和采样比例调整来增强对现实场景中尺度和视角变化的适应性。

Result: 实验表明UCA能在各种VLM-AD模型和驾驶场景中诱导错误驾驶命令，显著超越现有最先进攻击方法（3-P指标提升30%），并在不同视角和动态条件下表现出强攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UCA是首个针对VLM-AD的通用伪装攻击框架，具有物理可实现性和强泛化能力，展示了在实际部署中的高潜力，为VLM-AD系统的安全性研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising
research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning
capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains
vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve
misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing
attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily
target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD
systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)
Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital
level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage
Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on
optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate
physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization
across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the
observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA
introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational
discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates
a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its
adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world
scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various
VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing
state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore,
UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic
conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.

Method: 使用各向异性3D高斯分布建模每个点周围的局部邻域，在局部几何域中通过直接点采样进行显式上采样，生成密集但粗糙的点云，然后通过精炼网络调整输出以获得更均匀的分布和更锐利的边缘。

Result: 在PU1K和PUGAN数据集上的广泛测试表明，PU-Gaussian实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PU-Gaussian通过高斯分布建模和显式采样方法，有效解决了点云上采样问题，代码和模型权重已公开。

Abstract: Point clouds produced by 3D sensors are often sparse and noisy, posing
challenges for tasks requiring dense and high-fidelity 3D representations.
Prior work has explored both implicit feature-based upsampling and
distance-function learning to address this, but often at the expense of
geometric interpretability or robustness to input sparsity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PU-Gaussian, a novel upsampling network that models the
local neighborhood around each point using anisotropic 3D Gaussian
distributions. These Gaussians capture the underlying geometric structure,
allowing us to perform upsampling explicitly in the local geometric domain by
direct point sampling. The sampling process generates a dense, but coarse,
point cloud. A subsequent refinement network adjusts the coarse output to
produce a more uniform distribution and sharper edges. We perform extensive
testing on the PU1K and PUGAN datasets, demonstrating that PU-Gaussian achieves
state-of-the-art performance. We make code and model weights publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了CNN具有纹理偏见的假设，提出了一个领域无关的框架来量化特征依赖，发现CNN主要依赖局部形状特征而非纹理，且这种依赖可以通过现代训练策略或架构缓解。不同领域的模型表现出不同的特征依赖模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新检验Geirhos等人关于CNN具有纹理偏见的假设，解决其线索冲突实验中的局限性，更准确地量化神经网络的特征依赖模式。

Method: 提出领域无关框架，通过系统性地抑制形状、纹理和颜色线索来量化特征依赖，避免强制选择冲突的混淆因素。在受控抑制条件下评估人类和神经网络的表现。

Result: 发现CNN并非固有纹理偏见，而是主要依赖局部形状特征。现代训练策略或架构（如ConvNeXt、ViTs）可以显著缓解这种依赖。不同领域模型特征依赖模式不同：计算机视觉模型优先形状，医学影像模型强调颜色，遥感模型更强依赖纹理。

Conclusion: CNN的特征依赖模式比先前认为的更复杂，不是固有的纹理偏见，而是受训练策略和架构影响。不同应用领域会形成不同的特征偏好，这对模型设计和应用有重要启示。

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently
texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep
learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the
cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we
propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through
systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the
confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks
under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently
texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless,
this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies
or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across
computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance
patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape,
medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a
stronger reliance towards texture. Code is available at

Result: 在公共CT数据集（包括真实配对基准）上的广泛实验表明，该方法在CT切片插值方面显著优于现有竞争方法

Conclusion: 验证了所提出框架的有效性，该方法能够充分利用3D CT体积的各向异性特性进行高质量的切片插值

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used non-invasive imaging
modalities for medical diagnosis. In clinical practice, CT images are usually
acquired with large slice thicknesses due to the high cost of memory storage
and operation time, resulting in an anisotropic CT volume with much lower
inter-slice resolution than in-plane resolution. Since such inconsistent
resolution may lead to difficulties in disease diagnosis, deep learning-based
volumetric super-resolution methods have been developed to improve inter-slice
resolution. Most existing methods conduct single-image super-resolution on the
through-plane or synthesize intermediate slices from adjacent slices; however,
the anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volume has not been well explored. In
this paper, we propose a novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT
slice interpolation by fully utilizing the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volume.
Specifically, we design a unique framework that takes high-resolution in-plane
texture details as a reference and transfers them to low-resolution
through-plane images. To this end, we introduce a multi-reference non-local
attention module that extracts meaningful features for reconstructing
through-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs significantly
better in CT slice interpolation than existing competing methods on public CT
datasets including a real-paired benchmark, verifying the effectiveness of the
proposed framework. The source code of this work is available at

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段使用预训练视频VAE和新型范围视图适配器进行前馈4D重建；第二阶段引入几何引导的视频扩散模型，使用渲染的历史4D场景作为先验，在轨迹条件下生成未来视图。提出Stereo Forcing策略处理几何曝光偏差。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在外观和几何重建、时间生成和新视角合成任务中达到最先进性能，同时在下游评估中表现竞争力。

Conclusion: PhiGenesis提供了一个有效的4D场景生成解决方案，成功解决了动态场景生成中的时间一致性和新视角合成挑战。

Abstract: Current generative models struggle to synthesize dynamic 4D driving scenes
that simultaneously support temporal extrapolation and spatial novel view
synthesis (NVS) without per-scene optimization. Bridging generation and novel
view synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified
framework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with
geometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera
parameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting
representations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis
leverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable
feed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture
supports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including
geometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a
geometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as
priors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address
geometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel
conditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising.
This method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative
influence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
appearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view
synthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance
in downstream evaluations. Homepage is at

Method: 采用两阶段预训练策略：首先通过自监督学习训练教师模型提取可迁移特征，然后结合监督学习和知识蒸馏将特征和临床知识转移到VersaMammo中。使用包含706,239张图像的多机构数据集。

Result: 在92个具体任务（68个内部任务和24个外部验证任务）中，VersaMammo在50个内部任务和20个外部任务中排名第一，平均排名分别为1.5和1.2。

Conclusion: VersaMammo展示了卓越的泛化能力和临床实用性，为实现可靠和可扩展的乳腺癌筛查和诊断提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of
cancer-related mortality in women globally. Mammography is essential for the
early detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. Despite recent progress in
foundation models (FMs) for mammogram analysis, their clinical translation
remains constrained by several fundamental limitations, including insufficient
diversity in training data, limited model generalizability, and a lack of
comprehensive evaluation across clinically relevant tasks. Here, we introduce
VersaMammo, a versatile foundation model for mammograms, designed to overcome
these limitations. We curated the largest multi-institutional mammogram dataset
to date, comprising 706,239 images from 21 sources. To improve generalization,
we propose a two-stage pre-training strategy to develop VersaMammo, a mammogram
foundation model. First, a teacher model is trained via self-supervised
learning to extract transferable features from unlabeled mammograms. Then,
supervised learning combined with knowledge distillation transfers both
features and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo. To ensure a comprehensive
evaluation, we established a benchmark comprising 92 specific tasks, including
68 internal tasks and 24 external validation tasks, spanning 5 major clinical
task categories: lesion detection, segmentation, classification, image
retrieval, and visual question answering. VersaMammo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, ranking first in 50 out of 68 specific internal tasks and 20 out
of 24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2,
respectively. These results demonstrate its superior generalization and
clinical utility, offering a substantial advancement toward reliable and
scalable breast cancer screening and diagnosis.

TL;DR: HiPerformer是一种创新的医学图像分割方法，采用模块化分层架构和局部-全局特征融合模块，有效解决了CNN-Transformer混合架构中特征不一致和信息丢失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CNN-Transformer混合架构的主流方法使用简单的特征融合技术（如串行堆叠、端点连接或点加），难以解决特征间的不一致性，容易导致信息冲突和丢失。

Method: HiPerformer编码器采用模块化分层架构，动态并行融合多源特征；设计局部-全局特征融合模块实现精确高效的特征整合；提出渐进金字塔聚合模块替代传统跳跃连接以增强多尺度特征表示能力。

Result: 在11个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有分割技术，具有更高的分割精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HiPerformer通过创新的架构设计有效解决了医学图像分割中局部细节与全局上下文融合的挑战，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Both local details and global context are crucial in medical image
segmentation, and effectively integrating them is essential for achieving high
accuracy. However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid
architectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial
stacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to
address the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information
conflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively
propose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular
hierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in
parallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information.
The modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling
capability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient
information transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of
features and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods.
Furthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve
precise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic
information, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and
resulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance
multi-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise
interference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to
replace traditional skip connections. Experiments on eleven public datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing segmentation
techniques, demonstrating higher segmentation accuracy and robustness. The code
is available at https://github.com/xzphappy/HiPerformer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于人类感知的人脸相似度度量方法，通过创建包含6400个三元组注释的数据集和度量学习来预测相似度，解决了现有模型在身份分类中难以衡量细微相似度差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社会对隐私问题的关注度提高，人脸匿名化技术不断发展，包括人脸替换方法。在保持匿名性和自然性之间需要平衡：过于相似的人脸会损害匿名性，而差异过大的人脸会降低自然性。现有模型主要关注二元身份分类（是否同一人），难以衡量"完全不同"与"高度相似但不同"等细微相似度差异。

Method: 提出基于人类感知的人脸相似度度量方法，创建包含6400个三元组注释的数据集，并采用度量学习来预测人脸相似度。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在人脸相似度预测和基于属性的人脸分类任务上都显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于人类感知的人脸相似度度量方法能够有效解决现有模型在细微相似度衡量方面的不足，为人脸匿名化技术提供了更精确的相似度评估工具。

Abstract: In response to rising societal awareness of privacy concerns, face
anonymization techniques have advanced, including the emergence of
face-swapping methods that replace one identity with another. Achieving a
balance between anonymity and naturalness in face swapping requires careful
selection of identities: overly similar faces compromise anonymity, while
dissimilar ones reduce naturalness. Existing models, however, focus on binary
identity classification "the same person or not", making it difficult to
measure nuanced similarities such as "completely different" versus "highly
similar but different." This paper proposes a human-perception-based face
similarity metric, creating a dataset of 6,400 triplet annotations and metric
learning to predict the similarity. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in both face similarity prediction and attribute-based
face classification tasks over existing methods.

TL;DR: FAST是一个针对工业异常分割的前景感知扩散框架，通过AIAS和FARM两个模块，实现了高效采样和结构特定的异常合成，在多个工业基准测试中优于现有方法。

Motivation: 工业异常分割严重依赖像素级标注，但真实世界中的异常往往稀缺、多样且标注成本高。现有的分割导向工业异常合成方法难以平衡采样效率和生成质量，且忽视了异常区域与背景区域的统计差异。

Method: 提出FAST框架，包含两个核心模块：AIAS（异常信息加速采样）和FARM（前景感知重建模块）。AIAS是一种无需训练的采样算法，通过粗到细聚合加速反向过程；FARM在采样过程中自适应调整掩码前景区域内的异常感知噪声。

Result: 在多个工业基准测试上的广泛实验表明，FAST在仅需10步采样的情况下，就能合成出最先进的分割导向异常，并在下游分割任务中持续优于现有异常合成方法。

Conclusion: FAST框架通过前景感知的扩散方法，有效解决了工业异常合成中的采样效率和生成质量问题，为分割任务提供了可控、结构特定的异常合成方案。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly segmentation relies heavily on pixel-level annotations,
yet real-world anomalies are often scarce, diverse, and costly to label.
Segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly synthesis (SIAS) has emerged as a
promising alternative; however, existing methods struggle to balance sampling
efficiency and generation quality. Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial
regions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between
anomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of
controllable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In
this paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring
two novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the
Foreground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling
algorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly
synthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine
aggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented
anomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the
anomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step,
preserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory.
Extensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST
consistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream
segmentation tasks. We release the code at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业中鹿只入侵造成的经济损失每年高达数亿美元，传统缓解策略劳动密集、成本高且效果有限，需要智能自主解决方案，但缺乏领域特定的数据集和现场部署研究阻碍了进展。

Method: 使用来自Idaho Cameratraps项目的3,095张标注图像构建数据集，比较YOLOv8、v9、v10和v11四种架构的12个模型变体，在NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU、Raspberry Pi 5和NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier平台上进行性能评估。

Result: Raspberry Pi无法实现实时检测，而NVIDIA Jetson在's'和'n'系列模型上可实现超过30 FPS的GPU加速推理。YOLOv11n、YOLOv8s和YOLOv9s在AP@.5 > 0.85的高精度和FPS > 30的计算效率之间达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 研究提供了首个领域特定的鹿只检测数据集和全面的模型评估，证明了较小但架构先进的模型在边缘设备上的可行性，为农业鹿只检测系统的实际部署提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion,
estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S.,
highlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies since these
methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming
systems. To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous
solutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress
in this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the
lack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field
deployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study
presents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models
for deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of
this work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available
dataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,
derived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive
comparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO
architectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a
high-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing
platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the
real-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific
model optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with
GPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals
that smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and
YOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and
computational efficiency (FPS > 30). To support further research, both the
source code and datasets are publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线购物增长，虚拟试穿技术需求上升，但姿态控制仍具挑战性。需要在不增加模型复杂度的情况下，实现准确的姿态对齐和灵活的姿势控制。

Method: 基于基线VTON模型，通过空间拼接姿态数据（比较姿态图和骨架），并引入混合掩码训练策略（细粒度掩码和边界框掩码），以支持不同姿态下的灵活产品集成。

Result: 实验表明，使用姿态图进行姿态拼接效果最佳，显著提升了姿态保持和输出真实感。混合掩码训练策略进一步增强了模型在不同姿态和条件下的适应性。

Conclusion: 通过简单的空间拼接姿态数据和混合掩码训练，可以在不增加参数的情况下有效提升VTON模型的姿态控制能力和输出质量，为虚拟试穿技术提供了实用的改进方案。

Abstract: As online shopping continues to grow, the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTON)
technology has surged, allowing customers to visualize products on themselves
by overlaying product images onto their own photos. An essential yet
challenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures
accurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse
orientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose
conditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting
the optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional
parameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.
  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the
reference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex
attention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this
pure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing
performance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional
parameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose
stitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose
preservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask
training strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model
to support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions.

Abstract: Existing video generation models excel at producing photo-realistic videos
from text or images, but often lack physical plausibility and 3D
controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel
framework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical
parameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that
learns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic,
sand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics
parameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point
trajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations
generated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel
spatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and
incorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical
plausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic,
physics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video
models, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing
methods in both visual quality and physical plausibility. Project Page:

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models highlight a clear trend toward

While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific
to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to
architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce
EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing

video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to
achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and
flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and
durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a
scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines
them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore,
we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video

Abstract: Progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) faces significant
bottlenecks, particularly in rigorously evaluating complex interactive systems
and acquiring the vast interaction data needed for training adaptive agents.
This paper posits that user simulation -- creating computational agents that
mimic human interaction with AI systems -- is not merely a useful tool, but is
a critical catalyst required to overcome these bottlenecks and accelerate AGI
development. We argue that realistic simulators provide the necessary
environments for scalable evaluation, data generation for interactive learning,
and fostering the adaptive capabilities central to AGI. Therefore, research
into user simulation technology and intelligent task agents are deeply
synergistic and must advance hand-in-hand. This article elaborates on the
critical role of user simulation for AGI, explores the interdisciplinary nature
of building realistic simulators, identifies key challenges including those
posed by large language models, and proposes a future research agenda.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL策略评估存在高方差（数据有限、长时任务）和高偏差（支持不均、环境模型不准确）问题，需要将可靠评估作为训练的首要原则

Method: 设计EvA-RL框架，策略训练同时最大化期望回报和最小化评估误差；扩展方法共同学习评估条件状态值预测器

Result: 在离散和连续动作领域中，EvA-RL能显著降低评估误差，同时保持有竞争力的回报

Conclusion: 这项工作为将可靠评估作为训练首要原则的新RL方法奠定了基础

Abstract: Policy evaluation is often a prerequisite for deploying safety- and
performance-critical systems. Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer
from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due
to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these
challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL)
paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an
alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in
which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously
minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme --
in other words, being "easy" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL
and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation,
conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can
be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis
and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation
accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme
within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an
assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical
results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that
EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive
returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that
treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.

Motivation: 系统通常通过重复相同的提示给大语言模型并聚合响应来提高可靠性，需要分析在固定计算预算下的最优分配策略。

Method: 在固定计算预算B=mn的约束下，分析自一致性估计器的性能，其中m是任务分布中采样的提示数量，n是每个提示的重复LLM调用次数。

Result: 分析结果表明，最优的预算分配策略是m和n与√B成比例，即大致将预算均分给提示采样和重复调用。

Conclusion: 在固定计算预算下，为了最大化大语言模型的可靠性，应该将预算大致均等地分配给提示采样和模型重复调用。

Abstract: Systems often repeat the same prompt to large language models (LLMs) and

Method: 引入计算认知负荷理论，设计ICE基准测试系统操纵上下文饱和和注意力残留两个负荷因素，在200个多跳推理问题上进行10次重复测试。

Result: 小型开源模型在控制条件下准确率为0%，而Gemini-2.0-Flash-001在控制条件下达到85%准确率，但在上下文饱和条件下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 动态的、认知感知的压力测试对于评估先进AI系统的真实韧性和安全性至关重要。

Abstract: The scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has exposed a critical gap
between their performance on static benchmarks and their fragility in dynamic,
information-rich environments. While models excel at isolated tasks, the
computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain
poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational
cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context
Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key
mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive
Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these
load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N
= 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant
performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller
open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2)
exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all
conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In
contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85%
accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation
under context saturation ($\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These
findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor
to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under
uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as
exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true
resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.

*Ramy ElMallah,Krish Chhajer,Chi-Guhn Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出StepEval评估框架，使用视觉语言模型自动评估机器人操作任务中的子目标完成情况，而不仅仅是报告最终成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人学习论文只报告单一二进制成功率，掩盖了多步骤操作任务中各子目标的成功失败情况，需要更细粒度的评估方法

Method: 设计StepEval框架，利用VLMs作为自动评判员，从记录图像或视频中评估子目标结果，生成每个子目标的成功率向量

Result: 提出了一个可扩展、社区驱动的开源项目蓝图，支持模型无关、单/多视图输入，轻量级易部署

Conclusion: StepEval旨在建立标准化、可复现的实践，让评估操作步骤而不仅仅是最终目标成为常规做法

Abstract: Robot learning papers typically report a single binary success rate (SR),
which obscures where a policy succeeds or fails along a multi-step manipulation
task. We argue that subgoal-level reporting should become routine: for each
trajectory, a vector of per-subgoal SRs that makes partial competence visible
(e.g., grasp vs. pour). We propose a blueprint for StepEval, a cost-aware
plug-in evaluation framework that utilizes vision-language models (VLMs) as
automated judges of subgoal outcomes from recorded images or videos. Rather
than proposing new benchmarks or APIs, our contribution is to outline design
principles for a scalable, community-driven open-source project. In StepEval,
the primary artifact for policy evaluation is the per-subgoal SR vector;
however, other quantities (e.g., latency or cost estimates) are also considered
for framework-optimization diagnostics to help the community tune evaluation
efficiency and accuracy when ground-truth subgoal success labels are available.
We discuss how such a framework can remain model-agnostic, support single- or
multi-view inputs, and be lightweight enough to adopt across labs. The intended
contribution is a shared direction: a minimal, extensible seed that invites
open-source contributions, so that scoring the steps, not just the final goal,
becomes a standard and reproducible practice.

Abstract: We investigate the application of Small Language Models (<10 billion

hallucination issues and computational cost challenges. The Nano Bio-Agent
(NBA) framework we implemented incorporates task decomposition, tool
orchestration, and API access into well-established systems such as NCBI and
AlphaGenome. Results show that SLMs combined with such agentic framework can
achieve comparable and in many cases superior performance versus existing
approaches utilising larger models, with our best model-agent combination
achieving 98% accuracy on the GeneTuring benchmark. Notably, small 3-10B
parameter models consistently achieve 85-97% accuracy while requiring much
lower computational resources than conventional approaches. This demonstrates
promising potential for efficiency gains, cost savings, and democratization of
ML-powered genomics tools while retaining highly robust and accurate
performance.

*Nathanael Jo,Ashia Wilson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个将AI评估作为推理的框架，挑战了将基准测试分数简单视为性能测量的传统观点，强调评估应该从能力理论出发，并推导出估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型在基准数据上的评估普遍存在可靠性问题，基准分数被当作简单测量，但实际上它们是推理过程，需要明确的能力理论支撑。

Method: 提出了评估作为推理的原则性框架，从能力理论出发推导估计方法，特别针对敏感性扰动问题，引入了考虑不确定性的推理方法，包括显著降低样本复杂度的自适应算法。

Result: 该框架为通过基准测试获得更可靠和可信的AI能力估计奠定了基础，解决了评估中的敏感性不确定性问题。

Conclusion: 评估应该被视为推理过程而非简单测量，这一视角借鉴了心理测量学等领域的经验，有望提升AI评估的可靠性和可信度。

Abstract: Evaluations of generative models on benchmark data are now ubiquitous, and
their outcomes critically shape public and scientific expectations of AI's
capabilities. Yet growing skepticism surrounds their reliability. How can we
know that a reported accuracy genuinely reflects a model's true performance?
Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are
inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to
assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make
this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as
inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for
estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has
not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address
a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations.
After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability
while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including
an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity. Together,
these contributions lay the groundwork for more reliable and trustworthy
estimates of AI capabilities as measured through benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法孤立处理复杂Text-to-SQL查询中的数学推理和模式导航挑战，导致推理过程碎片化，影响逻辑和结构正确性。

Method: SteinerSQL采用三阶段方法：数学分解识别所需表格（终端节点）、通过Steiner树问题构建最优推理支架、多级验证确保正确性。

Result: 在LogicCat和Spider2.0-Lite基准测试中分别达到36.10%和40.04%的执行准确率，使用Gemini-2.5-Pro模型。

Conclusion: SteinerSQL为复杂Text-to-SQL任务提供了一个统一的新范式，为更鲁棒和原则性的解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex Text-to-SQL queries that
demand both sophisticated mathematical reasoning and intricate schema
navigation. Existing methods often tackle these challenges in isolation,
creating a fractured reasoning process that compromises logical and structural
correctness. To resolve this, we introduce SteinerSQL, a framework that unifies
these dual challenges into a single, graph-centric optimization problem.
SteinerSQL operates in three stages: mathematical decomposition to identify
required tables (terminals), optimal reasoning scaffold construction via a
Steiner tree problem, and multi-level validation to ensure correctness. On the
challenging LogicCat and Spider2.0-Lite benchmarks, SteinerSQL establishes a
new state-of-the-art with 36.10% and 40.04% execution accuracy, respectively,
using Gemini-2.5-Pro. Beyond accuracy, SteinerSQL presents a new, unified
paradigm for Text-to-SQL, paving the way for more robust and principled
solutions to complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 当前强化学习训练的智能体在动态多轮用户交互中存在挑战，需要系统评估用户中心能力，但缺乏标准化框架。

Method: 提出UserRL框架，使用GRPO算法，系统分析不同轮级奖励分配和轨迹级评分计算对学习的影响，在Qwen3模型上进行实验。

Result: 发现三个关键结果：SFT冷启动对初始交互能力至关重要；精心设计的轨迹评分能实现更高效的多轮交互；开源模拟器是成本效益高的选择。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造和用户模拟选择与模型规模同等重要，UserRL为开发鲁棒的用户中心智能体提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in training agentic models that
move beyond static benchmarks to engage in dynamic, multi-turn interactions.
Yet, the ultimate value of such agents lies in their ability to assist users, a
setting where diversity and dynamics of user interaction pose challenges. In
this work, we propose UserRL, a unified framework for training and evaluating
user-centric abilities through standardized gym environments paired with
simulated users. We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and
trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect
learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal
three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial
interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate
trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions;
and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training,
open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and
transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of
reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and
establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric
agentic models. All codes and data are public for future research.

Motivation: 现代LLM推理依赖于大量的测试时计算，但模型冗余和指令跟随能力差导致计算效率低下，存在能力-成本权衡问题。

Method: 引入cepo优化推理工作流程，通过协同设计编排框架与底层模型能力，减少模型冗余输出，提高指令跟随效率。

Abstract: Modern LLM reasoning relies on extensive test-time computation, driven by
internal model training and external agentic orchestration. However, this
synergy is often inefficient, as model verbosity and poor instruction following
lead to wasted compute. We analyze this capability-cost trade-off and introduce
an optimized reasoning workflow (\cepo) that empowers smaller open-source

workflow to enable further research. Our work demonstrates a clear path toward
co-designing orchestration frameworks with the underlying model capabilities to
unlock powerful reasoning in small-to-medium sized models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在低代码/无代码环境中集成元认知层的架构模式，通过预测任务失败并主动发起人工交接来提高系统可靠性和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主代理在低代码/无代码环境中的非确定性带来的可靠性挑战，如陷入循环、生成错误输出或遭遇不可恢复故障，导致用户挫败感和信任崩溃。

Method: 集成一个次级"元认知"层来主动监控主要LCNC代理，基于定义的触发器（如过高延迟或重复动作）预测即将发生的任务失败，并主动发起人工交接。

Result: 原型系统的实证分析表明，该方法显著提高了整体任务成功率，但性能提升伴随着显著的计算开销增加。

Conclusion: 将人工交接重新定义为增强系统弹性、改善用户体验和通过提供代理内部状态透明度来建立信任的核心设计特征，而非失败的承认。

Abstract: The inherent non-deterministic nature of autonomous agents, particularly
within low-code/no-code (LCNC) environments, presents significant reliability
challenges. Agents can become trapped in unforeseen loops, generate inaccurate
outputs, or encounter unrecoverable failures, leading to user frustration and a
breakdown of trust. This report proposes a novel architectural pattern to
address these issues: the integration of a secondary, "metacognitive" layer
that actively monitors the primary LCNC agent. Inspired by human introspection,
this layer is designed to predict impending task failures based on a defined
set of triggers, such as excessive latency or repetitive actions. Upon
predicting a failure, the metacognitive agent proactively initiates a human
handoff, providing the user with a clear summary of the agent's "thought
process" and a detailed explanation of why it could not proceed. An empirical
analysis of a prototype system demonstrates that this approach significantly
increases the overall task success rate. However, this performance gain comes
with a notable increase in computational overhead. The findings reframe human
handoffs not as an admission of defeat but as a core design feature that
enhances system resilience, improves user experience, and builds trust by
providing transparency into the agent's internal state. The report discusses
the practical and ethical implications of this approach and identifies key
directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性规划方法在MDP求解中较少使用，因为其导致的不等式约束优化问题比基于贝尔曼方程的方法更难有效求解。本文旨在为LP-based MDPs提供更有效实用的理论基础。

Method: 利用不等式约束优化中广泛使用的对数障碍函数，将MDP的LP表述转化为无约束优化问题，从而可以通过梯度下降获得近似解。

Result: 提出了将LP-based MDPs转化为无约束优化问题的新方法，为梯度下降求解提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: 虽然方法看似简单，但本文首次对这一方法进行了系统的理论解释，填补了相关研究空白。

Abstract: There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs):
dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP).
Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of
both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based
methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained
attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based
methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained
optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively
compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to
establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more
effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier
function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the
LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This
reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient
descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a
thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been
developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在表示层面平衡全面安全性和细粒度可控性，需要一种既能保证安全性又不损害实用性的解决方案。

Method: 采用三阶段方法：1）在包含对抗性提示和良性查询的有理据数据集上微调LLM；2）训练结构化变分自编码器（VAE）学习解缠的潜在表示；3）通过操纵潜在维度实现选择性拒绝行为。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B上的实验显示安全可控性和响应可解释性显著提升，在Mistral-7B上的跨架构验证证实了方法的通用性。

Conclusion: 结构化表示级干预为构建更安全实用的LLM系统提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Achieving robust safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) while
preserving their utility remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches
often struggle to balance comprehensive safety with fine-grained
controllability at the representation level. We introduce LATENTGUARD, a novel
three-stage framework that combines behavioral alignment with supervised latent
space control for interpretable and precise safety steering. Our approach
begins by fine-tuning an LLM on rationalized datasets containing both
reasoning-enhanced refusal responses to adversarial prompts and
reasoning-enhanced normal responses to benign queries, establishing robust
behavioral priors across both safety-critical and utility-preserving scenarios.
We then train a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) on intermediate MLP
activations, supervised by multi-label annotations including attack types,
attack methods, and benign indicators. This supervision enables the VAE to
learn disentangled latent representations that capture distinct adversarial
characteristics while maintaining semantic interpretability. Through targeted
manipulation of learned latent dimensions, LATENTGUARD achieves selective
refusal behavior, effectively blocking harmful requests while preserving
helpfulness for legitimate use cases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate
significant improvements in both safety controllability and response
interpretability without compromising utility. Cross-architecture validation on
Mistral-7B confirms the generalizability of our latent steering approach,
showing consistent effectiveness across different model families. Our results
suggest that structured representation-level intervention offers a promising
pathway toward building safer yet practical LLM systems.

Motivation: 随着企业将云端LLMs集成到法律文档工作流中，保护敏感合同信息（如PII和商业敏感条款）成为关键挑战。

Method: CON-QA框架包含三个阶段：(i)使用本地LLM进行语义查询分解和查询感知文档块检索；(ii)通过结构化一对多映射方案匿名化检测到的敏感实体；(iii)云端LLM生成匿名化响应，本地使用会话一致的多对一反向映射准确重构原始答案。

Conclusion: CON-QA展示了其在安全企业级合同文档中的实际适用性，为保护敏感合同信息提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As enterprises increasingly integrate cloud-based large language models
(LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini into their legal document workflows,
protecting sensitive contractual information - including Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) and commercially sensitive clauses - has emerged
as a critical challenge. In this work, we propose CON-QA, a hybrid
privacy-preserving framework designed specifically for secure question
answering over enterprise contracts, effectively combining local and
cloud-hosted LLMs. The CON-QA framework operates through three stages: (i)
semantic query decomposition and query-aware document chunk retrieval using a
locally deployed LLM analysis, (ii) anonymization of detected sensitive
entities via a structured one-to-many mapping scheme, ensuring semantic
coherence while preventing cross-session entity inference attacks, and (iii)
anonymized response generation by a cloud-based LLM, with accurate
reconstruction of the original answer locally using a session-consistent
many-to-one reverse mapping. To rigorously evaluate CON-QA, we introduce
CUAD-QA, a corpus of 85k question-answer pairs generated over 510 real-world
CUAD contract documents, encompassing simple, complex, and summarization-style
queries. Empirical evaluations, complemented by detailed human assessments,
confirm that CON-QA effectively maintains both privacy and utility, preserves
answer quality, maintains fidelity to legal clause semantics, and significantly
mitigates privacy risks, demonstrating its practical suitability for secure,
enterprise-level contract documents.

Abstract: Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an intelligent system paradigm for
achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), serving as the cornerstone for
various applications and driving the evolution from cyberspace to physical
systems. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) and World Models
(WMs) have drawn significant attention for embodied AI. On the one hand, LLMs
empower embodied AI via semantic reasoning and task decomposition, bringing
high-level natural language instructions and low-level natural language actions
into embodied cognition. On the other hand, WMs empower embodied AI by building
internal representations and future predictions of the external world,
facilitating physical law-compliant embodied interactions. As such, this paper
comprehensively explores the literature in embodied AI from basics to advances,
covering both LLM driven and WM driven works. In particular, we first present
the history, key technologies, key components, and hardware systems of embodied
AI, as well as discuss its development via looking from unimodal to multimodal
angle. We then scrutinize the two burgeoning fields of embodied AI, i.e.,
embodied AI with LLMs/multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and embodied AI with WMs,
meticulously delineating their indispensable roles in end-to-end embodied
cognition and physical laws-driven embodied interactions. Building upon the
above advances, we further share our insights on the necessity of the joint
MLLM-WM driven embodied AI architecture, shedding light on its profound
significance in enabling complex tasks within physical worlds. In addition, we
examine representative applications of embodied AI, demonstrating its wide

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个多智能体临床诊断框架（MACD），通过让LLM在多智能体管道中自我学习临床知识，显著提高了复杂临床诊断的准确性，并在真实患者病例上超越了传统临床指南和人类医生的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在医疗应用中面临处理复杂真实世界临床诊断的挑战，传统提示工程和多智能体方法通常优化孤立推理，忽视了可重用临床经验的积累。

Method: 提出MACD框架，通过多智能体管道让LLM自我学习临床知识，包括总结、提炼和应用诊断见解，并扩展到MACD-人类协作工作流程，由多个LLM诊断智能体进行迭代咨询，辅以评估智能体和人类监督。

Result: 在7种疾病的4,390个真实患者病例上评估，MACD显著提高了主要诊断准确率，比既定临床指南提升高达22.3%，在某些数据子集上达到或超过人类医生表现（比纯医生诊断提升16%），MACD-人类工作流程比纯医生诊断提升18.6%。

Conclusion: 该工作为LLM辅助诊断提供了一个可扩展的自我学习范式，弥合了LLM内在知识与真实世界临床实践之间的差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in medical
applications, yet they face substantial challenges in handling complex
real-world clinical diagnoses using conventional prompting methods. Current
prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches typically optimize isolated
inferences, neglecting the accumulation of reusable clinical experience. To
address this, this study proposes a novel Multi-Agent Clinical Diagnosis (MACD)
framework, which allows LLMs to self-learn clinical knowledge via a multi-agent
pipeline that summarizes, refines, and applies diagnostic insights. It mirrors
how physicians develop expertise through experience, enabling more focused and
accurate diagnosis on key disease-specific cues. We further extend it to a
MACD-human collaborative workflow, where multiple LLM-based diagnostician
agents engage in iterative consultations, supported by an evaluator agent and
human oversight for cases where agreement is not reached. Evaluated on 4,390
real-world patient cases across seven diseases using diverse open-source LLMs
(Llama-3.1 8B/70B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama 70B), MACD significantly improves
primary diagnostic accuracy, outperforming established clinical guidelines with
gains up to 22.3% (MACD). On the subset of the data, it achieves performance on
par with or exceeding that of human physicians (up to 16% improvement over
physicians-only diagnosis). Additionally, on the MACD-human workflow, it
achieves an 18.6% improvement compared to physicians-only diagnosis. Moreover,
self-learned knowledge exhibits strong cross-model stability, transferability,
and model-specific personalization, while the system can generate traceable
rationales, enhancing explainability. Consequently, this work presents a
scalable self-learning paradigm for LLM-assisted diagnosis, bridging the gap
between the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs and real-world clinical practice.

Abstract: Swarm intelligence emerges from decentralised interactions among simple
agents, enabling collective problem-solving. This study establishes a
theoretical equivalence between pheromone-mediated aggregation in \celeg\ and
reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrating how stigmergic signals function as
distributed reward mechanisms. We model engineered nematode swarms performing
foraging tasks, showing that pheromone dynamics mathematically mirror
cross-learning updates, a fundamental RL algorithm. Experimental validation
with data from literature confirms that our model accurately replicates
empirical \celeg\ foraging patterns under static conditions. In dynamic
environments, persistent pheromone trails create positive feedback loops that
hinder adaptation by locking swarms into obsolete choices. Through
computational experiments in multi-armed bandit scenarios, we reveal that
introducing a minority of exploratory agents insensitive to pheromones restores
collective plasticity, enabling rapid task switching. This behavioural
heterogeneity balances exploration-exploitation trade-offs, implementing
swarm-level extinction of outdated strategies. Our results demonstrate that
stigmergic systems inherently encode distributed RL processes, where
environmental signals act as external memory for collective credit assignment.
By bridging synthetic biology with swarm robotics, this work advances
programmable living systems capable of resilient decision-making in volatile
environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出SAGE框架，将对抗性场景生成重新定义为多目标偏好对齐问题，实现推理时对对抗性和真实性权衡的细粒度控制，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗场景生成方法通常局限于单一固定的目标权衡，缺乏推理时的可操控性，无法为多样化训练和测试需求生成定制化场景。

Method: 提出分层组偏好优化方法，将硬可行性约束与软偏好解耦；通过微调两个偏好相反的专家模型，在推理时线性插值权重构建连续策略谱。

Result: 实验表明SAGE不仅能生成具有更优对抗性与真实性平衡的场景，还能更有效地进行驾驶策略的闭环训练。

Conclusion: SAGE框架通过理论支持的权重插值方法，实现了对抗场景生成的灵活可控，为自动驾驶系统的安全评估提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: Adversarial scenario generation is a cost-effective approach for safety
assessment of autonomous driving systems. However, existing methods are often
constrained to a single, fixed trade-off between competing objectives such as
adversariality and realism. This yields behavior-specific models that cannot be
steered at inference time, lacking the efficiency and flexibility to generate
tailored scenarios for diverse training and testing requirements. In view of
this, we reframe the task of adversarial scenario generation as a
multi-objective preference alignment problem and introduce a new framework
named \textbf{S}teerable \textbf{A}dversarial scenario \textbf{GE}nerator
(SAGE). SAGE enables fine-grained test-time control over the trade-off between
adversariality and realism without any retraining. We first propose
hierarchical group-based preference optimization, a data-efficient offline
alignment method that learns to balance competing objectives by decoupling hard
feasibility constraints from soft preferences. Instead of training a fixed
model, SAGE fine-tunes two experts on opposing preferences and constructs a
continuous spectrum of policies at inference time by linearly interpolating
their weights. We provide theoretical justification for this framework through
the lens of linear mode connectivity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SAGE not only generates scenarios with a superior balance of adversariality and
realism but also enables more effective closed-loop training of driving
policies. Project page: https://tongnie.github.io/SAGE/.

Motivation: 大语言模型在需要结构化逻辑流程的多步推理任务中，往往难以保持连贯的推理轨迹，现有方法如直接监督或对比目标存在局限性。

Method: 采用量子启发的保真度奖励机制，基于投影纠缠对态(PEPS)构建结构一致性指导，通过近端策略优化来增强推理轨迹的全局连贯性。

Result: 在GSM8K、StrategyQA和EntailmentBank等多样化数据集上的实验表明，该方法在算术推理、直觉推理和蕴含推理任务上均显著优于监督学习、对比学习和预训练基线方法。

Conclusion: 量子启发的保真度方法为提升大语言模型推理轨迹的连贯性提供了有效基础，证明了结构一致性指导在改善推理质量方面的优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with maintaining coherent
multi-step reasoning traces, particularly in tasks that require a structured
logical flow. This work introduces a quantum-inspired approach to address the
challenge by incorporating a fidelity-based reward derived from Projected
Entangled Pair States (PEPS) into Proximal Policy Optimization. Unlike prior
approaches that use direct supervision or contrastive objectives, the proposed
method guides learning through structural consistency, offering a novel
approach to enforce global coherence in generated reasoning traces. The
proposed framework is evaluated using multiple coherence-determining metrics on
diverse datasets such as GSM8K, StrategyQA, and EntailmentBank spanning
arithmetic, intuitive, and entailment-based reasoning. Results show that the
proposed quantum-inspired approach offers significant improvements over
supervised, contrastive, and pretrained baseline approaches, highlighting the
effectiveness of quantum-inspired fidelity as a foundation to improve reasoning
trace coherence in LLMs.

Abstract: We present Federation of Agents (FoA), a distributed orchestration framework
that transforms static multi-agent coordination into dynamic, capability-driven
collaboration. FoA introduces Versioned Capability Vectors (VCVs):
machine-readable profiles that make agent capabilities searchable through
semantic embeddings, enabling agents to advertise their capabilities, cost, and
limitations. Our aarchitecturecombines three key innovations: (1) semantic
routing that matches tasks to agents over sharded HNSW indices while enforcing
operational constraints through cost-biased optimization, (2) dynamic task
decomposition where compatible agents collaboratively break down complex tasks
into DAGs of subtasks through consensus-based merging, and (3) smart clustering
that groups agents working on similar subtasks into collaborative channels for
k-round refinement before synthesis. Built on top of MQTT,s publish-subscribe
semantics for scalable message passing, FoA achieves sub-linear complexity
through hierarchical capability matching and efficient index maintenance.
Evaluation on HealthBench shows 13x improvements over single-model baselines,
with clustering-enhanced laboration particularly effective for complex
reasoning tasks requiring multiple perspectives. The system scales horizontally
while maintaining consistent performance, demonstrating that semantic
orchestration with structured collaboration can unlock the collective
intelligence of heterogeneous federations of AI agents.

Conclusion: 通过记录这些实践经验，为类似系统的开发提供指导

Abstract: Research on lane change prediction has gained attention in the last few
years. Most existing works in this area have been conducted in simulation
environments or with pre-recorded datasets, these works often rely on
simplified assumptions about sensing, communication, and traffic behavior that
do not always hold in practice. Real-world deployments of lane-change
prediction systems are relatively rare, and when they are reported, the
practical challenges, limitations, and lessons learned are often
under-documented. This study explores cooperative lane-change prediction
through a real hardware deployment in mixed traffic and shares the insights
that emerged during implementation and testing. We highlight the practical
challenges we faced, including bottlenecks, reliability issues, and operational
constraints that shaped the behavior of the system. By documenting these
experiences, the study provides guidance for others working on similar

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的智能代理框架，用于辅助CT扫描协议的自然语言配置管理，旨在提高工作流程效率并减轻技术人员负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT扫描协议管理（包括调整采集参数、配置重建算法和选择后处理工具）耗时且需要专业知识，同时放射学领域面临熟练劳动力短缺问题。

Method: 结合上下文学习、指令跟随和结构化工具调用能力的LLM智能代理框架，能够识别相关协议元素并应用精确修改。

Result: 实验结果表明，该代理能有效检索协议组件、生成设备兼容的协议定义文件，并忠实执行用户请求。

Conclusion: 尽管在原理上证明可行性，但该方法在缺乏统一设备API时面临语法和语义有效性限制，以及处理模糊或复杂请求的挑战，但研究结果显示了基于LLM的代理支持CT成像扫描协议管理的清晰路径。

Abstract: Managing scan protocols in Computed Tomography (CT), which includes adjusting
acquisition parameters or configuring reconstructions, as well as selecting
postprocessing tools in a patient-specific manner, is time-consuming and
requires clinical as well as technical expertise. At the same time, we observe
an increasing shortage of skilled workforce in radiology. To address this
issue, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent framework is proposed to assist
with the interpretation and execution of protocol configuration requests given
in natural language or a structured, device-independent format, aiming to
improve the workflow efficiency and reduce technologists' workload. The agent
combines in-context-learning, instruction-following, and structured toolcalling
abilities to identify relevant protocol elements and apply accurate
modifications. In a systematic evaluation, experimental results indicate that
the agent can effectively retrieve protocol components, generate device
compatible protocol definition files, and faithfully implement user requests.
Despite demonstrating feasibility in principle, the approach faces limitations
regarding syntactic and semantic validity due to lack of a unified device API,
and challenges with ambiguous or complex requests. In summary, the findings
show a clear path towards LLM-based agents for supporting scan protocol
management in CT imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散概率模型的离线强化学习方法主要关注时域特征而忽略频域特征，导致频移问题和性能下降。作者观察到仅使用时域的方法会在频域低频分量中引入偏移，造成轨迹不稳定。

Method: 提出WFDiffuser框架，集成离散小波变换将轨迹分解为低频和高频分量，使用短时傅里叶变换提取频域特征，并采用交叉注意力机制促进跨频率交互。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试上的大量实验表明，WFDiffuser有效缓解了频移问题，产生了更平滑、更稳定的轨迹，并在决策性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该研究从频域新视角解决了强化学习中的频移问题，WFDiffuser框架通过频域特征整合显著提升了扩散模型在离线强化学习中的表现。

Abstract: Diffusion probability models have shown significant promise in offline
reinforcement learning by directly modeling trajectory sequences. However,
existing approaches primarily focus on time-domain features while overlooking
frequency-domain features, leading to frequency shift and degraded performance
according to our observation. In this paper, we investigate the RL problem from
a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that
time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency
components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and
degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier
Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates
Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and
high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each
component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention
mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency
interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate
that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother,
more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing
methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we focused on using deep learning methods for detecting money
laundering in financial transaction networks, in order to demonstrate that it
can be used as a complement or instead of the more commonly used rule-based
systems and conventional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) systems. The paper
explores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in
the global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML
systems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the
sophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these
challenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link
analysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the
utilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness
Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the
system's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the
influence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The
significance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial
sector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional
AML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new
implementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively
structured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the
context of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the
prospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of
emerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms. This
integration holds promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AML systems by
refining their capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准特征归因方法（如Integrated Gradients或SHAP）计算密集，不适合实时应用，特别是在医疗、生物识别和人机交互等时间序列领域需要高效解释方法。

Method: 针对LSTM网络，提出逆加权聚合方案，强调跨时间步激活的稳定性和幅度，利用模型内部激活来估计特征重要性。

Result: 在三个生物识别注视数据集上的评估显示，DeepACTIF在严重特征缩减（前10%特征）下保持预测性能，在准确性和统计鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法，计算时间和内存使用量降低数个数量级。

Conclusion: DeepACTIF是边缘设备（如移动XR头显或嵌入式健康监测器）上实时可解释性的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Feature attribution is essential for interpreting deep learning models,
particularly in time-series domains such as healthcare, biometrics, and
human-AI interaction. However, standard attribution methods, such as Integrated
Gradients or SHAP, are computationally intensive and not well-suited for
real-time applications. We present DeepACTIF, a lightweight and
architecture-aware feature attribution method that leverages internal
activations of sequence models to estimate feature importance efficiently.
Focusing on LSTM-based networks, we introduce an inverse-weighted aggregation
scheme that emphasises stability and magnitude of activations across time
steps. Our evaluation across three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF
not only preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction (top
10% of features) but also significantly outperforms established methods,
including SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT, in terms of both accuracy and statistical
robustness. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and effect size analysis, we
demonstrate that DeepACTIF yields more informative feature rankings with
significantly lower error across all top-k conditions (10 - 40%). Our
experiments demonstrate that DeepACTIF not only reduces computation time and
memory usage by orders of magnitude but also preserves model accuracy when
using only top-ranked features. That makes DeepACTIF a viable solution for
real-time interpretability on edge devices such as mobile XR headsets or
embedded health monitors.

Conclusion: 该方法通过集成模糊规则激活与小波基选择和时间相关权重，显著提高了信用卡欺诈检测的准确性和有效性。

Abstract: Credit card fraud is assuming growing proportions as a major threat to the
financial position of American household, leading to unpredictable changes in
household economic behavior. To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid
analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes
several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a
multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention
mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical
transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic
shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule
library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian
membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that
adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns,
increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference
stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and
anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from
classical ANFIS which has fixed input-output relations since it integrates
fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal
correlation weights via a modular training procedure. Experimental results show
that the RMSE was reduced by 17.8% compared with local neuro-fuzzy models and
conventional LSTM models.

involves data preparation, algorithm implementation, and performance evaluation
using precision, recall, and F1 scores. Results indicate that a hybrid

accuracy of outlier identification in complex financial data. This study
contributes to the field of audit analytics by providing insights into the

Method: 通过控制数据伪相关性效应，比较SOTA方法与监督线性探针的性能，并评估各种方法在分布外泛化场景下的表现。

Abstract: We critically assess the efficacy of the current SOTA in hallucination

driven by a spurious correlation with data. Controlling for this effect,
state-of-the-art performs no better than supervised linear probes, while
requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning across datasets. Out-of-distribution

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在表达不确定性方面存在困难，现有方法如模型logits和概率估计往往产生过度自信且校准不佳的结果，这在临床诊断等高风险领域存在可靠性问题。

Method: 采用近似贝叶斯计算（ABC）方法，将LLMs视为随机模拟器来推断预测概率的后验分布，这是一种无需似然函数的贝叶斯推断方法。

Result: 在两个临床相关基准测试中，ABC方法相比标准基线方法将准确率提高了46.9%，Brier分数降低了74.4%，并通过预期校准误差和预测熵指标显示出更好的校准性能。

Conclusion: ABC方法能有效改善LLMs的不确定性表达能力，为高风险领域的可靠部署提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their widespread applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often
struggle to express uncertainty, posing a challenge for reliable deployment in
high stakes and safety critical domains like clinical diagnostics. Existing
standard baseline methods such as model logits and elicited probabilities
produce overconfident and poorly calibrated estimates. In this work, we propose
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a likelihood-free Bayesian inference,
based approach that treats LLMs as a stochastic simulator to infer posterior
distributions over predictive probabilities. We evaluate our ABC approach on
two clinically relevant benchmarks: a synthetic oral lesion diagnosis dataset
and the publicly available GretelAI symptom-to-diagnosis dataset. Compared to
standard baselines, our approach improves accuracy by up to 46.9\%, reduces
Brier scores by 74.4\%, and enhances calibration as measured by Expected
Calibration Error (ECE) and predictive entropy.

Motivation: 解决RAG系统中的时间性失败问题，特别是在网络安全数据上的应用需求。

Method: 使用两种方法：简单的新近性先验方法和用于主题演化的聚类启发式方法。

Result: 新近性先验方法在新鲜度任务上达到1.00准确率，聚类启发式方法仅获得0.08 F1分数。

Conclusion: 趋势检测需要超越简单启发式的方法，新近性先验在处理时间性失败方面表现良好，但主题演化检测需要更复杂的方法。

Abstract: We address temporal failures in RAG systems using two methods on

freshness tasks. In contrast, a clustering heuristic for topic evolution failed
(0.08 F1-score), showing trend detection requires methods beyond simple

### [109] [Learning from Observation: A Survey of Recent Advances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19379)
*Returaj Burnwal,Hriday Mehta,Nirav Pravinbhai Bhatt,Balaraman Ravindran*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个学习从观察（LfO）或仅状态模仿学习（SOIL）的框架，用于分类和调查现有LfO方法，并识别开放问题和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的模仿学习算法需要专家状态和动作信息，但在实际应用中专家动作往往难以获取，因此需要开发仅使用专家状态访问信息的LfO方法。

Method: 构建LfO框架，从轨迹构建、假设和算法设计选择等角度对现有LfO方法进行分类和调查，并与离线强化学习、基于模型的强化学习和分层强化学习等相关领域建立联系。

Result: 提出了一个系统的LfO分类框架，识别了现有方法的共同特征和差异，并建立了与相关领域的连接。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于理解LfO领域的现状，识别了开放问题，并为未来研究提供了方向建议。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) algorithms offer an efficient way to train an agent
by mimicking an expert's behavior without requiring a reward function. IL
algorithms often necessitate access to state and action information from expert
demonstrations. Although expert actions can provide detailed guidance,
requiring such action information may prove impractical for real-world
applications where expert actions are difficult to obtain. To address this
limitation, the concept of learning from observation (LfO) or state-only
imitation learning (SOIL) has recently gained attention, wherein the imitator
only has access to expert state visitation information. In this paper, we
present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO
methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's
design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related
fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL. Finally, we use our
framework to identify open problems and suggest future research directions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TensLoRA是一个统一的框架，将LoRA更新聚合为高阶张量，建模广泛的基于张量的低秩适应方法，支持模态特定的压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA方法将注意力投影中的可训练低秩矩阵视为独立，缺乏系统性的联合张量适应框架。

Method: 引入TensLoRA框架，将LoRA更新聚合为高阶张量，支持模态特定的压缩率，允许根据模态和任务定制参数预算。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，张量构建直接影响性能，有时在相似参数数量下优于标准LoRA。

Conclusion: TensLoRA提供了一个系统化的张量适应框架，能够更有效地利用参数预算，提升模型适应性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is widely used to efficiently adapt Transformers
by adding trainable low-rank matrices to attention projections. While
effective, these matrices are considered independent for each attention
projection (Query, Key, and Value) and each layer. Recent extensions have
considered joint, tensor-based adaptations, but only in limited forms and
without a systematic framework. We introduce TensLoRA, a unified framework that
aggregates LoRA updates into higher-order tensors and models a broad family of
tensor-based low-rank adaptations. Our formulation generalizes existing
tensor-based methods and enables mode-specific compression rates, allowing
parameter budgets to be tailored according to the modality and task.
Experiments on vision and language benchmarks reveal that the tensor
construction directly impacts performance, sometimes better than standard LoRA
under similar parameter counts.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is critical for edge and High Performance Computing
(HPC) where data is not centralized and privacy is crucial. We present OmniFed,
a modular framework designed around decoupling and clear separation of concerns
for configuration, orchestration, communication, and training logic. Its
architecture supports configuration-driven prototyping and code-level
override-what-you-need customization. We also support different topologies,
mixed communication protocols within a single deployment, and popular training
algorithms. It also offers optional privacy mechanisms including Differential
Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Aggregation (SA), as well
as compression strategies. These capabilities are exposed through well-defined
extension points, allowing users to customize topology and orchestration,
learning logic, and privacy/compression plugins, all while preserving the
integrity of the core system. We evaluate multiple models and algorithms to
measure various performance metrics. By unifying topology configuration,
mixed-protocol communication, and pluggable modules in one stack, OmniFed
streamlines FL deployment across heterogeneous environments. Github repository

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeMosaic是一个多变量时间序列预测框架，通过自适应补丁嵌入和分段解码来解决时间异质性问题，在多个基准数据集上表现出优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于补丁的方法采用固定长度分割，忽略了局部时间动态的异质性和预测解码的异质性，导致信息密集区域细节丢失、稳定段冗余，以及无法捕捉短期和长期预测的不同复杂性。

Method: TimeMosaic采用自适应补丁嵌入来根据局部信息密度动态调整粒度，平衡模式重用与结构清晰度，同时保持时间连续性；并引入分段解码，将每个预测视界视为相关子任务，适应特定视界的难度和信息需求。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，TimeMosaic相比现有方法实现了持续改进，在包含3210亿观测值的大规模语料库上训练的模型达到了与最先进TSFM相竞争的性能。

Conclusion: TimeMosaic通过解决时间异质性挑战，在多变量时间序列预测任务中表现出优越性能，为处理复杂的时间动态提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting is essential in domains such as finance,
transportation, climate, and energy. However, existing patch-based methods
typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of
local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such
designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in
stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term
and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that
aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch
embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information
density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving
temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that
treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to
horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying
a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing
methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion
observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了SMOTE、SMOTE-Tomek和ADASYN三种处理信用违约数据类别不平衡问题的技术，结合多种机器学习模型进行信用违约预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信用违约数据集通常存在类别不平衡问题，违约者比例远低于非违约者，这会影响机器学习模型的预测性能。

Method: 使用真实信用违约数据集，在应用Boruta特征选择和DBSCAN异常检测后，比较了传统分类器（朴素贝叶斯、KNN）和集成提升算法（XGBoost、AdaBoost、GBM、Light GBM）在平衡前后的性能。

Result: Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM组合模型表现最佳，F1-score达82.56%，G-mean为82.98%，ROC-AUC为90.90%，PR-AUC为91.85%。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建更稳健的自适应信用违约系统奠定了基础，对全球日益增长的信用交易具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study examines credit default prediction by comparing three techniques,
namely SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, that are commonly used to address the
class imbalance problem in credit default situations. Recognizing that credit
default datasets are typically skewed, with defaulters comprising a much
smaller proportion than non-defaulters, we began our analysis by evaluating
machine learning (ML) models on the imbalanced data without any resampling to
establish baseline performance. These baseline results provide a reference
point for understanding the impact of subsequent balancing methods. In addition
to traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
our study also explores the suitability of advanced ensemble boosting
algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, Gradient
Boosting Machines (GBM), and Light GBM for credit default prediction using
Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection, both before and
after resampling. A real-world credit default data set sourced from the
University of Cleveland ML Repository was used to build ML classifiers, and
their performances were tested. The criteria chosen to measure model
performance are the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC-AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), G-mean, and
F1-scores. The results from this empirical study indicate that the
Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier outperformed the other ML models
(F1-score: 82.56%, G-mean: 82.98%, ROC-AUC: 90.90%, PR-AUC: 91.85%) in a credit
default context. The findings establish a foundation for future progress in
creating more resilient and adaptive credit default systems, which will be
essential as credit-based transactions continue to rise worldwide.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究比较了统计和深度学习模型在电力价格概率预测中的不确定性量化方法，发现LEAR模型在概率预测方面表现良好，而DDNN模型通过结合数据和模型不确定性可以改善预测性能，其中保形预测方法在捕捉不确定性方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概率预测模型通常无法完全捕捉不确定性，这些不确定性不仅来自数据本身，还来自模型和分布选择。研究旨在评估最先进的统计和深度学习模型在电力价格预测中的不确定性量化能力。

Method: 研究比较了深度分布神经网络（DDNNs）和LASSO估计的自回归（LEAR）方法。DDNNs采用了集成方法、蒙特卡洛dropout和保形预测来处理模型不确定性，LEAR则结合了分位数回归平均（QRA）、GARCH和保形预测。

Result: LEAR模型在概率预测方面表现良好，不受不确定性量化方法影响。DDNNs通过结合数据和模型不确定性改善了点和概率预测性能。保形预测方法在捕捉不确定性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 所有模型都表现出竞争力，但相对性能取决于点和概率预测的度量标准选择。不确定性量化对于提高预测模型的可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management,
and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for
this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of
uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent
of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model
and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty
quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic
forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In
particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment
them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal
prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the
LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile
regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of
performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms
of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification
method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data
and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting.
Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal
prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under
consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance
depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在基准测试中表现优异，但在实际部署中常因对微小分布偏移的敏感性而表现不佳，传统评估方法无法准确反映真实性能。

Method: 通过估计分布外检测器的输出概率来建模运行时分布偏移发生率，结合网络正确性的条件概率构建二元树结构，通过遍历树计算可信精度估计。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于传统评估方法，精度估计误差通常在0.01到0.1之间，在医学分割基准测试中成功应用于风险评估。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度学习系统提供了更可靠的性能评估和可操作的风险评估框架，特别适用于安全关键应用场景。

Abstract: Despite achieving excellent performance on benchmarks, deep neural networks
often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor, often
imperceptible shifts in input data, known as distributional shifts. These
shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during
evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we
propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk
assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the
incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability
from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with
conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary
tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of
network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which
we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of
distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional
evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and
0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical
segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by
associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and
value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for
improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems,
particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate
performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.

TL;DR: 本文分析了跨频迁移学习（CFTL）在时间序列预测中的基准测试问题，发现当前评估方法存在多个缺陷，并通过大规模实验证明统计模型仍优于现有基础预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CFTL基准测试存在多个问题：过度依赖小规模评估数据集、样本量处理不当、报告次优统计模型、未考虑预训练与测试数据集重叠风险。这些缺陷导致对CFTL性能评估不准确。

Method: 重新实现广泛采用的神经预测网络并适配CFTL设置；仅在专有和合成数据上进行预训练，避免测试泄漏；在15个大型多样的公共预测竞赛数据集上进行评估。

Result: 统计模型及其集成在sCRPS上比现有FFMs高出8.2%，在MASE上高出20%；但合成数据集预训练确实能将FFM准确率提高7%。

Conclusion: 统计模型在时间序列预测中仍具有显著优势，但通过合成数据预训练可以改善基础预测模型的性能。需要更严谨的基准测试方法来准确评估CFTL框架。

Abstract: Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework
for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation
forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current
benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This
shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation
datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary
statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account
for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To
address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of
widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup;
we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent
test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition
datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is
frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their
ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and
by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic
dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在惩罚项选择上缺乏物理依据，特别是在非平衡涨落系统中需要与底层涨落结构一致的惩罚策略。

Method: 基于大偏差原理设计物理信息的惩罚项，使惩罚项与系统的热力学涨落特性一致，建立热力学一致的PINNs扩展。

Result: 建立了分析后验估计，并通过经验比较验证了THINNs相对于传统惩罚策略的优越性。

Conclusion: THINNs提供了一种物理上更合理的PINNs框架，特别适用于非平衡涨落系统的PDE求解。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of deep learning models
aiming to approximate solutions of PDEs by training neural networks to minimize
the residual of the equation. Focusing on non-equilibrium fluctuating systems,
we propose a physically informed choice of penalization that is consistent with
the underlying fluctuation structure, as characterized by a large deviations
principle. This approach yields a novel formulation of PINNs in which the
penalty term is chosen to penalize improbable deviations, rather than being
selected heuristically. The resulting thermodynamically consistent extension of
PINNs, termed THINNs, is subsequently analyzed by establishing analytical a
posteriori estimates, and providing empirical comparisons to established
penalization strategies.

TL;DR: DELTAformer通过委托令牌注意力机制，在多元时间序列建模中实现线性扩展同时提升性能，解决了传统transformer变量数量扩展瓶颈和变量间信息混合噪声积累问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列建模中变量数量的扩展瓶颈和变量间无差别信息混合导致的噪声积累和性能下降问题，需要一种既能提高可扩展性又能改善性能的方法。

Method: 提出委托令牌注意力机制(DELTAformer)，通过委托令牌约束变量间建模，只允许选择性信息传播，同时保持时间维度上的完整建模能力。

Result: DELTAformer在变量数量上实现线性扩展，同时超越标准transformer性能，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平，在噪声环境中表现出更好的信号聚焦能力和噪声抗性。

Conclusion: 通过将模型设计与MTS领域特定挑战对齐，DELTAformer能够同时实现线性扩展和性能提升，证明了在transformer设计中可扩展性和性能可以协同改进。

Abstract: Variable count is among the main scalability bottlenecks for transformer
modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing
consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a
potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is
likely exacerbated by sparsity of informative signals characteristic of many
MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from
indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While
scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in
transformer design, we show that both can be improved simultaneously in MTS by
strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable
mixing. Our proposed method, transformer with Delegate Token Attention
(DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate
tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal
modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model
to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to
propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales
linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard
transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and
baselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than
standard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior
noise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by
aligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our
advantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually
improving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.

Motivation: 现有的合理反事实解释方法虽然考虑了数据分布特征以提高真实性，但其优化模型引入了大量约束，导致计算成本高昂。

Method: 重新审视DACE框架，提出改进的MILP公式减少LOF目标约束数量，并将其应用于带有标准缩放器的线性SVM分类器。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持解释质量的同时实现了更快的求解时间。

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了在反事实解释和数据科学应用中更高效的LOF建模的前景。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanation (CE) is a widely used post-hoc method that
provides individuals with actionable changes to alter an unfavorable prediction
from a machine learning model. Plausible CE methods improve realism by
considering data distribution characteristics, but their optimization models
introduce a large number of constraints, leading to high computational cost. In
this work, we revisit the DACE framework and propose a refined Mixed-Integer
Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that significantly reduces the number of
constraints in the local outlier factor (LOF) objective component. We also
apply the method to a linear SVM classifier with standard scaler. The
experimental results show that our approach achieves faster solving times while
maintaining explanation quality. These results demonstrate the promise of more
efficient LOF modeling in counterfactual explanation and data science
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有分子生成方法在严格等变性与可扩展性之间的权衡问题，旨在开发一种既能保持物理对称性又具有高效采样能力的分子生成方法。

Method: 提出了三种基于框架的扩散变体：全局框架扩散(GFD)、局部框架扩散(LFD)和不变框架扩散(IFD)，并结合EdgeDiT（具有边缘感知注意力的扩散Transformer）来增强表达能力。

Result: 在QM9数据集上，GFD与EdgeDiT结合实现了最先进的性能：测试NLL为-137.97（标准尺度）和-141.85（双倍尺度），原子稳定性98.98%，分子稳定性90.51%，采样速度比EDM快近2倍。

Conclusion: 基于框架的扩散为分子生成提供了一个可扩展、灵活且物理基础扎实的范式，强调了全局结构保持的关键作用。

Abstract: Recent methods for molecular generation face a trade-off: they either enforce
strict equivariance with costly architectures or relax it to gain scalability
and flexibility. We propose a frame-based diffusion paradigm that achieves
deterministic E(3)-equivariance while decoupling symmetry handling from the
backbone. Building on this paradigm, we investigate three variants: Global
Frame Diffusion (GFD), which assigns a shared molecular frame; Local Frame
Diffusion (LFD), which constructs node-specific frames and benefits from
additional alignment constraints; and Invariant Frame Diffusion (IFD), which
relies on pre-canonicalized invariant representations. To enhance expressivity,
we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention.
  On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale,
alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%. These
results surpass all equivariant baselines while maintaining high validity and
uniqueness and nearly 2x faster sampling compared to EDM. Altogether, our study
establishes frame-based diffusion as a scalable, flexible, and physically
grounded paradigm for molecular generation, highlighting the critical role of
global structure preservation.

TL;DR: MCFM是一种学习耗散动力学的方法，通过将保守-耗散分裂构建到向量场和结构保持采样器中，避免违反第一原理，确保长期滚动的稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经代理方法在注入能量时往往会破坏长期滚动的稳定性，MCFM旨在解决这一问题，通过结构保持的方法学习耗散动力学。

Method: MCFM通过条件流匹配在短转换上训练，避免长滚动伴随。在推理时采用Strang-prox方案，交替进行辛更新和近端度量步骤，确保离散能量衰减。

Result: 在受控机械基准测试中，MCFM产生的相图更接近真实情况，能量增加和正能量率事件显著少于同等表达能力的无约束神经流，同时匹配终端分布拟合。

Conclusion: MCFM通过将保守-耗散分裂融入向量场和采样器，提供了连续和离散时间保证，实现了能量守恒、单调耗散和稳定滚动。

Abstract: Metriplectic conditional flow matching (MCFM) learns dissipative dynamics
without violating first principles. Neural surrogates often inject energy and
destabilize long-horizon rollouts; MCFM instead builds the
conservative-dissipative split into both the vector field and a structure
preserving sampler. MCFM trains via conditional flow matching on short
transitions, avoiding long rollout adjoints. In inference, a Strang-prox scheme
alternates a symplectic update with a proximal metric step, ensuring discrete
energy decay; an optional projection enforces strict decay when a trusted
energy is available. We provide continuous and discrete time guarantees linking
this parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and
stable rollouts. On a controlled mechanical benchmark, MCFM yields phase
portraits closer to ground truth and markedly fewer energy-increase and
positive energy rate events than an equally expressive unconstrained neural
flow, while matching terminal distributional fit.

Conclusion: DAWM的模块化设计能够有效生成适合一步TD学习的合成数据，为扩散世界模型与标准离线RL算法的结合提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based world models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
synthesizing realistic long-horizon trajectories for offline reinforcement
learning (RL). However, many existing methods do not directly generate actions
alongside states and rewards, limiting their compatibility with standard
value-based offline RL algorithms that rely on one-step temporal difference
(TD) learning. While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards,
and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased
training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose
\textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward
trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired
with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This
modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step
TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training.
Empirically, we show that conservative offline RL algorithms such as TD3BC and
IQL benefit significantly from training on these augmented trajectories,
consistently outperforming prior diffusion-based baselines across multiple
tasks in the D4RL benchmark.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于力分析思想的深度学习模型学习过程分析框架，将训练样本间的相互影响分解为相似性和更新强度两个部分，用于解释模型在不同系统中的行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度学习模型如何随时间学习，通过物理力分析的类比来理解训练过程中样本间的相互影响机制。

Method: 采用力分析框架，将训练样本间的影响分解为相似性（样本间的相似程度）和更新强度（训练更新的力度）两个维度，并在多种学习任务中应用这一方法。

Result: 该框架成功解释了为什么某些样本具有非平凡的学习路径、为什么某些LLM微调方法有效（或无效），以及为什么更简单、结构化的模式更容易被学习。同时发现了改进模型训练的新策略。

Conclusion: 虽然该方法仍在发展中，但为系统性地解释模型行为提供了一种新的视角，有助于深入理解深度学习模型的学习机制。

Abstract: This thesis explores how deep learning models learn over time, using ideas
inspired by force analysis. Specifically, we zoom in on the model's training
procedure to see how one training example affects another during learning, like
analyzing how forces move objects. We break this influence into two parts: how
similar the two examples are, and how strong the updating force is. This
framework helps us understand a wide range of the model's behaviors in
different real systems. For example, it explains why certain examples have
non-trivial learning paths, why (and why not) some LLM finetuning methods work,
and why simpler, more structured patterns tend to be learned more easily. We
apply this approach to various learning tasks and uncover new strategies for
improving model training. While the method is still developing, it offers a new
way to interpret models' behaviors systematically.

TL;DR: 提出了一个模块化学习框架，利用系统的组合结构先验知识来识别模块的输入/输出函数，并减少所需训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在合成生物学等应用中，虽然模块的输入/输出函数和信号未知，但系统的组合架构知识可以显著减少学习系统输入/输出映射所需的训练数据量。

Method: 引入模块可识别性概念，允许从系统输入/输出数据的子集中恢复模块的输入/输出函数，并为受遗传电路启发的系统类别提供理论保证。使用考虑组合结构的神经网络进行学习。

Result: 计算研究表明，考虑组合结构的神经网络能够学习组成模块的输入/输出函数，并在训练集分布之外的输入上预测系统输出。相比之下，不考虑结构的神经网络无法在训练集分布之外的输入上进行预测。

Conclusion: 该框架通过减少实验数据需求并允许模块识别，有望简化合成生物电路和一般多模块系统的设计。

Abstract: In several applications, including in synthetic biology, one often has
input/output data on a system composed of many modules, and although the
modules' input/output functions and signals may be unknown, knowledge of the
composition architecture can significantly reduce the amount of training data
required to learn the system's input/output mapping. Learning the modules'
input/output functions is also necessary for designing new systems from
different composition architectures. Here, we propose a modular learning
framework, which incorporates prior knowledge of the system's compositional
structure to (a) identify the composing modules' input/output functions from
the system's input/output data and (b) achieve this by using a reduced amount
of data compared to what would be required without knowledge of the
compositional structure. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular
identifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from
a subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees
on a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory
on computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for
the compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output
functions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set
distribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure
is unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set
distribution. By reducing the need for experimental data and allowing module
identification, this framework offers the potential to ease the design of
synthetic biological circuits and of multi-module systems more generally.

Motivation: 解决复杂抗体格式设计中个体功能域在新格式中功能和稳定性无法保证的工程挑战

Method: 结合抗体序列和结构上下文的多模态机器学习框架，采用反映实际部署场景的评估协议

Result: 在最具挑战性的"新抗体、无数据"场景中，最佳多模态模型实现高预测准确率，能够优先选择有前景的候选方案

Conclusion: 针对特定领域定制的多模态表示在抗体重新格式化预测中优于大型预训练蛋白质语言模型

Abstract: Modern therapeutic antibody design often involves composing multi-part
assemblages of individual functional domains, each of which may be derived from
a different source or engineered independently. While these complex formats can
expand disease applicability and improve safety, they present a significant
engineering challenge: the function and stability of individual domains are not
guaranteed in the novel format, and the entire molecule may no longer be
synthesizable. To address these challenges, we develop a machine learning
framework to predict "reformatting success" -- whether converting an antibody
from one format to another will succeed or not. Our framework incorporates both
antibody sequence and structural context, incorporating an evaluation protocol
that reflects realistic deployment scenarios. In experiments on a real-world
antibody reformatting dataset, we find the surprising result that large
pretrained protein language models (PLMs) fail to outperform simple,
domain-tailored, multimodal representations. This is particularly evident in
the most difficult evaluation setting, where we test model generalization to a
new starting antibody. In this challenging "new antibody, no data" scenario,
our best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, enabling
prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度哈希方法在将实值表示转换为二进制代码时会产生显著的信息损失，需要一种更有效的方法来减少这种损失并提高哈希性能。

Method: 提出vMF哈希损失，将数据映射到M维超球面空间，将每个数据类别建模为遵循不同vMF分布的点，通过最大化vMF分布之间的分离度来优化哈希表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在时间序列索引任务上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: vMF哈希方法能够有效减少信息损失，提高时间序列语义哈希的性能，为高效的时间序列搜索和检索提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Indexing time series by creating compact binary representations is a
fundamental task in time series data mining. Recently, deep learning-based
hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on
semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing
is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash
codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised
representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a
discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes,
but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a
von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data
to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss
and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The
designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF
distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each
semantically different data sample. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines. The implementation is publicly available at

*Peng Lu,Jerry Huang,Qiuhao Zeng,Xinyu Wang,Boxing Wang,Philippe Langlais,Yufei Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mamba模型在处理超出预训练长度的上下文时性能显著下降，作者发现这是由于状态转移矩阵A的谱特性导致的状态收敛问题，并提出通过谱缩放方法来改善长上下文泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的注意力机制具有二次复杂度，因此出现了Mamba等次二次复杂度的状态空间模型。但Mamba在应用于比预训练更长的上下文时性能急剧下降，需要解决其长度泛化问题。

Method: 通过分析状态转移矩阵A的谱特性，发现状态收敛行为与长度扩展的关系。提出对预训练Mamba模型应用谱缩放方法，选择性调制各层A矩阵的谱来改善长上下文泛化。

Result: 谱缩放方法能显著改善Mamba在长上下文设置下的性能，特别是在单纯调制Δt参数失败的情况下仍然有效。

Conclusion: 状态转移矩阵的谱特性在状态空间模型的长度泛化中起关键作用，谱缩放为具有结构化转移矩阵的状态空间模型提供了更好的长度泛化途径。

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism in Transformer models has
motivated the development of alternative architectures with sub-quadratic
scaling, such as state-space models. Among these, Mamba has emerged as a
leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of
language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly
deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during
pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension.
Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the
out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within
the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent
works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of
discretization time steps, $\exp(-\sum_{t=1}^N\Delta_t)$, we establish a
connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches
infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\mathbf{A}$, offering a
well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome
this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to
pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by
selectively modulating the spectrum of $\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We
show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply
modulating $\Delta_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for
better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition
matrices.

TL;DR: TIMED是一个统一的生成框架，用于合成高质量的时间序列数据，通过结合扩散模型、监督网络和对抗训练来解决时间序列生成的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列生成在预测和异常检测等领域至关重要，但真实数据往往稀缺、嘈杂或收集成本高。与静态数据生成不同，时间序列需要同时建模观测值的边际分布和时序依赖关系。

Method: TIMED框架整合了三个核心组件：1）去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）通过前向-反向扩散过程捕捉全局结构；2）监督网络通过教师强制训练学习自回归依赖；3）Wasserstein批评器提供对抗反馈确保时序平滑性和保真度。此外还加入了最大均值差异（MMD）损失来对齐特征空间分布。

Result: 在多个多元时间序列基准测试中，TIMED生成的序列比最先进的生成模型更加真实和时序一致。

Conclusion: TIMED通过统一的生成框架有效解决了时间序列合成的关键挑战，在多样性和样本质量方面表现出色，为时间序列生成任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic time series is a fundamental yet
challenging task across domains such as forecasting and anomaly detection,
where real data can be scarce, noisy, or costly to collect. Unlike static data
generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal
distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that
govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework
that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture
global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network
trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through
next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial
feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real
and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All
components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for
sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both
unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results
across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED
generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than
state-of-the-art generative models.

Conclusion: 该方法既能产生结构化空间相关性，又具有良好的可扩展性和易实现性，为全球站点天气预报提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Global Station Weather Forecasting (GSWF) is a key meteorological research
area, critical to energy, aviation, and agriculture. Existing time series
forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation
when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the
intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting
forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured
Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of
subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial
correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph
representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph
Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation.
Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting
model by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both
scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it
is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve
performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at
low running costs.

Abstract: The surge in the significance of time series in digital health domains
necessitates advanced methodologies for extracting meaningful patterns and
representations. Self-supervised contrastive learning has emerged as a
promising approach for learning directly from raw data. However, time series
data in digital health is known to be highly noisy, inherently involves concept
drifting, and poses a challenge for training a generalizable deep learning
model. In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused
by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework
that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol
representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts,
and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding
deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting. We
demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve significantly better
performance where significant data shifting exists.

Abstract: Distribution estimation under local differential privacy (LDP) is a
fundamental and challenging task. Significant progresses have been made on
categorical data. However, due to different evaluation metrics, these methods
do not work well when transferred to numerical data. In particular, we need to
prevent the probability mass from being misplaced far away. In this paper, we
propose a new approach that express the sample distribution using wavelet
expansions. The coefficients of wavelet series are estimated under LDP. Our
method prioritizes the estimation of low-order coefficients, in order to ensure
accurate estimation at macroscopic level. Therefore, the probability mass is
prevented from being misplaced too far away from its ground truth. We establish
theoretical guarantees for our methods. Experiments show that our wavelet
expansion method significantly outperforms existing solutions under Wasserstein
and KS distances.

TL;DR: 该论文使用临床上下文信息（出院摘要）来评估胸部X光诊断模型的性能，发现模型在预测试概率低的情况下表现更好，而在高预测试概率情况下表现较差，且模型可能过度依赖临床上下文作为诊断捷径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前胸部X光数据集上的机器学习模型虽然平均性能良好，但不足以证明其临床实用性。需要更全面的评估方法来验证模型是否真正具备诊断能力，而不是仅仅依赖临床上下文信息。

Method: 利用每个胸部X光检查前的出院摘要记录，计算每个X光标签的"先验"或"预测试"概率，作为临床医生解读X光时的上下文知识代理。通过这种方法评估模型在不同预测试概率下的表现差异。

Result: 研究发现：1）对于多个诊断标签，模型在预测试概率很低的情况下表现最佳，而在预测试概率较高时表现明显较差；2）在平衡测试集上，模型性能急剧下降，表明其诊断能力可能主要来自对临床上下文的推断而非真正的诊断信号。

Conclusion: 使用临床笔记衍生的上下文信息进行分析是评估临床视觉模型更严格和细粒度评估的有前景方向，有助于揭示模型是否真正具备诊断能力。

Abstract: Public healthcare datasets of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) have long been a popular
benchmark for developing computer vision models in healthcare. However, strong
average-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is
insufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical
context, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic
evaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR
diagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a
``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for
existing contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs.
Using this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several
diagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test
probability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test
probability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether
strong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an
ability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that
performance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not
exist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives
from inferring this clinical context. We argue that this style of analysis,
using context derived from clinical notes, is a promising direction for more
rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of clinical vision models.

Conclusion: C²Prompt通过显式增强提示通信中的类间知识一致性，有效缓解了联邦持续学习中的时空遗忘问题

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from
continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key
challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial
forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown
advanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we
underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise
knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge
coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across
clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt
class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During
prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge
conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts,
intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we
propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method
that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt
communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism
(LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across
clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a
class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate
inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant
knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks
demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中，随着任务演变，梯度步长不再带来改进，导致准确率停滞或下降，尽管有足够的容量和监督。现有单一指标（如Hessian秩、锐度水平等）无法可靠预测LoT。

Method: 引入两个互补标准：批量大小感知的梯度噪声界限和曲率波动控制界限，结合成每层预测阈值。基于此阈值构建简单的每层调度器，将每层的有效步长控制在安全限制内。

Result: 该方法在CReLU、Wasserstein正则化和L2权重衰减等场景中稳定了训练并提高了准确性，学习率轨迹与典型衰减模式相似。

Conclusion: 提出的预测阈值和分层调度器方法能有效预测和缓解持续学习中的训练能力丧失问题，优于单一指标预测方法。

Abstract: Loss of trainability (LoT) in continual learning occurs when gradient steps
no longer yield improvement as tasks evolve, so accuracy stalls or degrades
despite adequate capacity and supervision. We analyze LoT incurred with Adam
through an optimization lens and find that single indicators such as Hessian
rank, sharpness level, weight or gradient norms, gradient-to-parameter ratios,
and unit-sign entropy are not reliable predictors. Instead we introduce two
complementary criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature
volatility-controlled bound that combine into a per-layer predictive threshold
that anticipates trainability behavior. Using this threshold, we build a simple
per-layer scheduler that keeps each layers effective step below a safe limit,
stabilizing training and improving accuracy across concatenated ReLU (CReLU),
Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay, with learned learning-rate
trajectories that mirror canonical decay.

Conclusion: 结论表明，仅通过补全缺失块训练的变换器能够隐式发现一个统一的、资源自适应的迭代求解器，涵盖预测、估计和Nyström外推，这突显了上下文学习的强大能力。

Abstract: We train a linear attention transformer on millions of masked-block matrix
completion tasks: each prompt is masked low-rank matrix whose missing block may
be (i) a scalar prediction target or (ii) an unseen kernel slice of Nystr\"om
extrapolation. The model sees only input-output pairs and a mean-squared loss;
it is given no normal equations, no handcrafted iterations, and no hint that
the tasks are related. Surprisingly, after training, algebraic unrolling
reveals the same parameter-free update rule across three distinct computational
regimes (full visibility, rank-limited updates, and distributed computation).
We prove that this rule achieves second-order convergence on full-batch
problems, cuts distributed iteration complexity, and remains accurate with
rank-limited attention. Thus, a transformer trained solely to patch missing
blocks implicitly discovers a unified, resource-adaptive iterative solver
spanning prediction, estimation, and Nystr\"om extrapolation, highlighting a
powerful capability of in-context learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了X-MultiTask多任务元学习框架，用于估计个体化治疗效果，在脊柱融合术和脊柱侧弯矫正手术中表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外科决策复杂且需要理解患者特征、干预措施和结果之间的因果关系。在脊柱融合术等高风险场景中，传统统计方法难以处理复杂异质数据，限制了准确估计个体化治疗效果的能力。

Method: 开发了多任务元学习框架X-MultiTask，将每个手术决策建模为独立任务，同时学习跨任务的共享表示。在训练目标中加入了逆概率加权以增强因果有效性。

Result: 在两个数据集上的评估显示：在脊柱融合数据集上，前路组平均AUC达0.84，后路组为0.77，治疗效果估计指标ε_NN-PEHE为0.2778，ε_ATE为0.0763；在AIS数据集上，ε_NN-PEHE为0.2551，ε_ATE为0.0902，均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: X-MultiTask通过提供稳健的患者特异性因果估计，为推进个性化外科护理和改善患者预后提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Surgical decision-making is complex and requires understanding causal
relationships between patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. In
high-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate
estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to
the reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex,
heterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning
framework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision
(e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct
task while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal
validity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the
training objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public
spinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs.
posterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset
(368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs.
non-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves
the highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive
performance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in
treatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$
(0.2778) and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs
in AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains,
with $\epsilon_{\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\epsilon_{\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902.
By providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a
powerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient
outcomes. The code is available at https://github.com/Wizaaard/X-MultiTask.

Motivation: 解决离线强化学习中的外推误差问题，防止策略在训练过程中偏离回放缓冲区中的行为分布。

Method: 扩展批量约束强化学习，约束智能体的动作空间，使其行为与回放缓冲区相似，同时与正交动作空间流形保持距离。

Result: 算法训练稳定，在标准连续控制基准测试中取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的约束方法既保持了批量约束的简洁性，又为外推误差提供了直观的物理解释，是一种有效的离线强化学习算法。

Abstract: We draw an analogy between static friction in classical mechanics and
extrapolation error in off-policy RL, and use it to formulate a constraint that
prevents the policy from drifting toward unsupported actions. In this study, we
present Frictional Q-learning, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for
continuous control, which extends batch-constrained reinforcement learning. Our
algorithm constrains the agent's action space to encourage behavior similar to
that in the replay buffer, while maintaining a distance from the manifold of
the orthonormal action space. The constraint preserves the simplicity of
batch-constrained, and provides an intuitive physical interpretation of
extrapolation error. Empirically, we further demonstrate that our algorithm is
robustly trained and achieves competitive performance across standard
continuous control benchmarks.

Conclusion: Sobolev训练通过改善损失景观的条件和加速收敛，为深度学习提供了有效的训练方法，其理论框架为理解该方法的内在机制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Sobolev training, which integrates target derivatives into the loss
functions, has been shown to accelerate convergence and improve generalization
compared to conventional $L^2$ training. However, the underlying mechanisms of
this training method remain only partially understood. In this work, we present
the first rigorous theoretical framework proving that Sobolev training
accelerates the convergence of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks. Under a
student-teacher framework with Gaussian inputs and shallow architectures, we
derive exact formulas for population gradients and Hessians, and quantify the
improvements in conditioning of the loss landscape and gradient-flow
convergence rates. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical
findings and show that the benefits of Sobolev training extend to modern deep
learning tasks.

Conclusion: PPGFlowECG框架具有实际应用潜力，可用于现实世界的心血管筛查，通过可穿戴设备实现连续心脏监测。

Abstract: In clinical practice, electrocardiography (ECG) remains the gold standard for
cardiac monitoring, providing crucial insights for diagnosing a wide range of
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, its reliance on specialized equipment
and trained personnel limits feasibility for continuous routine monitoring.
Photoplethysmography (PPG) offers accessible, continuous monitoring but lacks
definitive electrophysiological information, preventing conclusive diagnosis.
Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically
valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges,
including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and
the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose
PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent
space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate
ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade
dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than
118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease
annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG
translation and cardiovascular disease detection. Moreover, cardiologist-led
evaluations confirm that the synthesized ECGs achieve high fidelity and improve
diagnostic reliability, underscoring our method's potential for real-world
cardiovascular screening.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏专家混合模型在在线推理中面临模型规模大、专家路由复杂的问题，且任务信息不可得导致路由错误。

Method: Tanbr通过历史数据估计任务分布，使用二进制树逐步划分合并权重空间，并应用神经bandit学习从合并权重到模型性能的非线性映射，以决定最优专家合并。

Result: 实验表明，Tanbr将推理延迟降低至少45%，内存使用减少高达25%，同时保持高准确性。

Conclusion: Tanbr在连续决策空间中实现了亚线性遗憾界，显著提升了稀疏专家混合模型在线推理的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become a preferred architecture for
scaling Transformer capacity without increasing computational cost, as it
activates only a small subset of experts for each input. However, deploying
such an approach for \textit{online inference} remains challenging due to the
large size of a full SMoE model and the complexity of expert routing,
especially in resource-constrained edge networks. Moreover, during the online
inference, task information is often unavailable, making the task-level routing
error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured adaptive neural
bandit router, \texttt{Tanbr}, to enable efficient and reliable online MoE
inference. Instead of relying on explicit task tags, \texttt{Tanbr} estimates
the task distribution over time from historical data and uses it to guide
task-aware expert merging within a given pre-trained MoE. To handle the large
continuous space of merging weights, \texttt{Tanbr} employs a binary tree to
progressively partition the space and generate finer candidate weights. It then
applies a neural bandit to learn the non-linear mapping from merging weight to
model performance and decides optimal expert merging. We prove that
\texttt{Tanbr} achieves a sublinear regret bound of {\small
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log(T))$} over {\small $T$} rounds, despite operating
over a continuous decision space, matching regret bounds compared to existing
methods. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{Tanbr} reduces inference
latency by at least {\small $45\%$} and memory usage by up to {\small $25\%$},
while maintaining a high accuracy compared to many state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: RDAR是一种学习每个智能体相关性的策略，通过识别哪些智能体可以从预训练行为模型的输入中排除，从而减少计算复杂度。


<details>

Motivation: 人类驾驶员每次只关注少量智能体，而自动驾驶系统需要处理复杂场景中的所有智能体，现有注意力机制计算成本高。

Method: 将掩码过程建模为马尔可夫决策过程，动作由表示智能体选择的二进制掩码组成。

Result: 在大规模驾驶数据集上评估，RDAR能够学习准确的数值相关性度量，在显著减少处理的智能体数量的同时，保持与最先进行为模型相当的驾驶性能。

Conclusion: RDAR提供了一种有效的方法来识别对决策有影响的智能体，从而降低计算成本而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Human drivers focus only on a handful of agents at any one time. On the other
hand, autonomous driving systems process complex scenes with numerous agents,
regardless of whether they are pedestrians on a crosswalk or vehicles parked on
the side of the road. While attention mechanisms offer an implicit way to
reduce the input to the elements that affect decisions, existing attention
mechanisms for capturing agent interactions are quadratic, and generally
computationally expensive. We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent
relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled
vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a
pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov
Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent
selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate
its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving
comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and
performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of
the art behavior model.

TL;DR: 本文提出VCRL，一种基于奖励方差动态控制训练样本难度的课程强化学习框架，用于改进LLM在数学推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于rollout的强化学习方法未能显式考虑LLM对不同难度样本的学习能力，这与人类从易到难的数学推理认知过程相悖。

Method: 通过分析发现rollout组奖励的方差部分反映了当前样本对LLM的难度，基于此提出VCRL框架，根据组奖励方差动态调整训练样本难度。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试和两个模型上的实验表明，VCRL优于当前的LLM强化学习基线方法。

Conclusion: VCRL通过模拟人类从易到难的学习过程，有效提升了LLM在数学推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Policy-based reinforcement learning currently plays an important role in
improving LLMs on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, existing rollout-based
reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly
consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels,
which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning
tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the
rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current
sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower
variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based
on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that
dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance
of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models
reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.

Abstract: In many engineering and applied science domains, high-dimensional nonlinear
filtering is still a challenging problem. Recent advances in score-based
diffusion models offer a promising alternative for posterior sampling but
require repeated retraining to track evolving priors, which is impractical in
high dimensions. In this work, we propose the Conditional Score-based Filter
(CSF), a novel algorithm that leverages a set-transformer encoder and a
conditional diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate posterior
sampling without retraining. By decoupling prior modeling and posterior
sampling into offline and online stages, CSF enables scalable score-based
filtering across diverse nonlinear systems. Extensive experiments on benchmark
problems show that CSF achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency
across diverse nonlinear filtering scenarios.

Conclusion: 结果为KANs在非参数回归中的应用提供了理论基础，突显其作为现有方法的结构化替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a structured and interpretable
framework for multivariate function approximation by composing univariate
transformations through additive or multiplicative aggregation. This paper
establishes theoretical convergence guarantees for KANs when the univariate
components are represented by B-splines. We prove that both additive and hybrid
additive-multiplicative KANs attain the minimax-optimal convergence rate
$O(n^{-2r/(2r+1)})$ for functions in Sobolev spaces of smoothness $r$. We
further derive guidelines for selecting the optimal number of knots in the
B-splines. The theory is supported by simulation studies that confirm the
predicted convergence rates. These results provide a theoretical foundation for
using KANs in nonparametric regression and highlight their potential as a
structured alternative to existing methods.

Motivation: 北方森林储存了30-40%的陆地碳，其中大部分位于气候脆弱的永久冻土中。优化森林管理以实现碳固存和永久冻土保护的双重目标存在复杂权衡，现有工具无法充分解决这一问题。

Method: 开发了BoreaRL多目标强化学习环境，包含物理基础的能源、碳和水通量耦合模拟器。支持两种训练范式：站点特定模式和通才模式。评估了多目标RL算法，并分析了学习策略。

Result: 发现碳目标比解冻目标显著更容易优化，解冻导向策略在两个范式中学习进展最小。在通才设置下，标准偏好条件方法完全失败，而简单的课程学习方法通过策略选择训练片段实现了更优性能。

Conclusion: 稳健的气候适应性森林管理对当前MORL方法仍具挑战性，BoreaRL为开发更有效方法提供了有价值的基准。开源BoreaRL以加速气候应用中的多目标RL研究。

Abstract: Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable
permafrost soils, making their management critical for climate mitigation.
However, optimizing forest management for both carbon sequestration and
permafrost preservation presents complex trade-offs that current tools cannot
adequately address. We introduce $\textbf{BoreaRL}$, the first multi-objective
reinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest
management, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy,
carbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms:
site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning
robust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of
multi-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning
difficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw
(permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing
minimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings,
standard preference-conditioned approaches fail entirely, while a naive
curriculum learning approach achieves superior performance by strategically
selecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct
management philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive
high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies
balance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining
carbon gains. Our results demonstrate that robust climate-adaptive forest
management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL
as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches. We
open-source BoreaRL to accelerate research in multi-objective RL for climate
applications.

Method: 对几种最先进的预训练符号回归方法进行系统性实证评估，测试其在预训练分布内和一系列分布外挑战中的性能。

Result: 发现显著的二分现象：预训练模型在分布内表现良好，但在分布外场景下性能持续下降。

Conclusion: 泛化差距是实践中的关键障碍，严重限制了预训练方法在现实世界应用中的实际使用价值。

Abstract: Symbolic regression algorithms search a space of mathematical expressions for
formulas that explain given data. Transformer-based models have emerged as a
promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a
large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is
critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to
problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored.
In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the
generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic
regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training
distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several
state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while
pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently
degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization
gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the
practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展到文本、多模态和自监督学习场景，为数据高效学习提供新途径，推动下一代AI发展，代码已开源为Python包。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in unbalanced
classification tasks, is often hindered by the failure to differentiate between
critical instances near the decision boundary and redundant samples
concentrated in the core of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a
method to systematically identify and differentiate between these two types of
data. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show
that the boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score by up to 10\%
on 96\% of the datasets, whereas our core-aware reduction method compresses
datasets up to 90\% while preserving their accuracy, making it 10 times more
powerful than the original dataset. Beyond imbalanced classification, our
method has broader implications for efficient model training, particularly in
computationally expensive domains such as Large Language Model (LLM) training.
By prioritizing high-quality, decision-relevant data, our approach can be
extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering
a pathway to faster convergence, improved generalization, and significant
computational savings. This work paves the way for future research in
data-efficient learning, where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force

Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has

electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the
zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial
charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in
the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output
level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to
the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output
mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with
strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian
prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy
performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing
error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large
condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a
high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC,
comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the
periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results
on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and
efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

TL;DR: MCGrad是一种新颖且可扩展的多重校准算法，解决了现有多重校准方法在工业应用中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多重校准方法在工业应用中受限，因为需要手动指定子组、不可扩展或可能损害其他模型性能指标。

Method: MCGrad不需要显式指定受保护组，具有可扩展性，并且通常能改善其他ML评估指标而不是损害它们。

Result: MCGrad已在Meta投入生产，成为数百个生产模型的一部分，并在公共数据集上取得了良好结果。

Conclusion: MCGrad解决了现有多重校准方法的局限性，为工业应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose MCGrad, a novel and scalable multicalibration algorithm.
Multicalibration - calibration in sub-groups of the data - is an important
property for the performance of machine learning-based systems. Existing
multicalibration methods have thus far received limited traction in industry.
We argue that this is because existing methods (1) require such subgroups to be
manually specified, which ML practitioners often struggle with, (2) are not
scalable, or (3) may harm other notions of model performance such as log loss
and Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (PRAUC). MCGrad does not require
explicit specification of protected groups, is scalable, and often improves
other ML evaluation metrics instead of harming them. MCGrad has been in
production at Meta, and is now part of hundreds of production models. We
present results from these deployments as well as results on public datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据集规模有限和可用性不足，重症监护时间序列的基础模型研究相对较少，需要开发能够在小数据集上有效工作的模型。

Method: 使用双向Transformer架构，在合并的电子健康记录数据集上进行预训练，然后在与训练源不同的数据集上进行微调，用于死亡率预测任务。

Result: 模型在小数据集（<5,000样本）上表现优于监督基线，特别是在死亡率预测任务中。

Conclusion: 自监督基础模型在重症监护时间序列分析中具有潜力，能够支持资源受限环境下的通用和稳健临床应用。

Abstract: Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare have expanded rapidly in
recent years, yet foundation models for critical care time series remain
relatively underexplored due to the limited size and availability of datasets.
In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model for
critical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained on
pooled electronic health record datasets. We demonstrate effective transfer
learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset distinct from the training
sources for mortality prediction, where it outperforms supervised baselines,
particularly for small datasets ($<5,000$). These contributions highlight the
potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care times series
to support generalizable and robust clinical applications in resource-limited
settings.

*Xueliang Zhao,Wei Wu,Jian Guan,Zhuocheng Gong,Lingpeng Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptCoT 2.0是一个可扩展的框架，通过期望最大化循环迭代优化提示合成，生成更困难多样的训练问题，显著提升大语言模型在数学和编程推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高质量训练问题稀缺：人工标注成本高且有限，现有合成语料库往往过于简单或狭窄。PromptCoT 1.0显示在提示合成中注入推理过程能提高问题难度。

Method: 使用期望最大化循环替代手工启发式方法，迭代优化推理过程来指导提示构建。支持两种后训练机制：自我对弈（强模型通过可验证反馈自主改进）和监督微调（弱模型从教师蒸馏轨迹中学习）。

Result: 在Qwen3-30B模型上实现SOTA：AIME 24/25和HMMT 25分别提升4.4、4.8、5.3分，LiveCodeBench v5/v6提升6.1和5.0分，Codeforces Elo提升35分。Qwen2.5-7B仅用合成提示训练达到73.1%准确率。

Conclusion: PromptCoT 2.0确立了提示合成作为扩展推理能力的新维度，为未来开源模型提供了可扩展的基础框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving from conversational systems into
strong reasoners for tasks such as Olympiad mathematics and competitive
programming. While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven
progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems:
human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora
are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales
into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we
present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted
heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are
iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that
are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts
support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve
autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2)
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled
traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new
state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME
24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on
Codeforces. In SFT, training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct solely on synthetic prompts
boosts accuracy to 73.1 (AIME 24), 65.6 (AIME 25), and 53.4 (LiveCodeBench v5),
surpassing models trained on human or hybrid data. Analyses further confirm
that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct
problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling
reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future
open-source models. The implementation is available at

*Xinyu Liu,Chao Qin,Wei You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于结构化随机多臂老虎机纯探索问题的Frank-Wolfe自博弈方法，通过将问题重新表述为凹-凸鞍点问题，解决了结构约束带来的算法设计挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在结构化随机多臂老虎机中，传统的渐近分析简化为一个极大极小优化问题，但结构约束会引入尖锐的病理现象，如非唯一最优解、最优设计在最佳臂上质量为零等，这给算法设计和分析带来了困难。

Method: 通过允许怀疑者采用混合策略重新表述博弈问题，提出Frank-Wolfe自博弈方法：一种无投影、无正则化、无需调参的方法，其单热更新与老虎机采样范式相匹配。采用微分包含论证和Lyapunov函数分析来证明收敛性。

Result: 理论分析表明，在线性老虎机的最佳臂识别任务中，该方法能够实现游戏值的全局收敛，数值实验验证了对偶间隙的消失。

Conclusion: FWSP方法有效解决了结构化探索问题中的病理挑战，通过连续时间极限分析证明了收敛性，为结构化多臂老虎机问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits,
aiming to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis from a finite set of
alternatives. For a broad class of tasks, asymptotic analyses reduce to a
maximin optimization that admits a two-player zero-sum game interpretation
between an experimenter and a skeptic: the experimenter allocates measurements
to rule out alternatives while the skeptic proposes alternatives. We
reformulate the game by allowing the skeptic to adopt a mixed strategy,
yielding a concave-convex saddle-point problem. This viewpoint leads to
Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP): a projection-free, regularization-free,
tuning-free method whose one-hot updates on both sides match the bandit
sampling paradigm. However, structural constraints introduce sharp pathologies
that complicate algorithm design and analysis: our linear-bandit case study
exhibits nonunique optima, optimal designs with zero mass on the best arm,
bilinear objectives, and nonsmoothness at the boundary. We address these
challenges via a differential-inclusion argument, proving convergence of the
game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits. Our analysis proceeds
through a continuous-time limit: a differential inclusion with a Lyapunov
function that decays exponentially, implying a vanishing duality gap and
convergence to the optimal value. Although Lyapunov analysis requires
differentiability of the objective, which is not guaranteed on the boundary, we
show that along continuous trajectories the algorithm steers away from
pathological nonsmooth points and achieves uniform global convergence to the
optimal game value. We then embed the discrete-time updates into a perturbed
flow and show that the discrete game value also converges. Building on FWSP, we
further propose a learning algorithm based on posterior sampling. Numerical
experiments demonstrate a vanishing duality gap.

TL;DR: LIRF是一种新的少样本生成方法，通过构建几何结构化的潜空间和迭代生成-校正-增强循环来解决少样本生成中的过拟合和模式崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在少样本生成中存在过拟合、模式崩溃以及忽略潜空间几何结构的问题，需要一种能够保持数据流形几何特性的新方法。

Method: LIRF使用带有流形保持损失的自动编码器建立稳定的潜空间，然后通过迭代的生成-校正-增强循环，利用几何校正算子将样本拉向数据流形。

Result: 该方法在AFHQ-Cat数据集上生成了连贯的高分辨率图像，收敛定理证明了生成流形与真实数据流形之间Hausdorff距离的可预测减小。

Conclusion: LIRF为数据稀缺的生成建模提供了一个理论上有基础且实践有效的解决方案，流形保持潜空间和收缩校正机制是关键组成部分。

Abstract: Few-shot generation, the synthesis of high-quality and diverse samples from
limited training data, remains a significant challenge in generative modeling.
Existing methods trained from scratch often fail to overcome overfitting and
mode collapse, and fine-tuning large models can inherit biases while neglecting
the crucial geometric structure of the latent space. To address these
limitations, we introduce Latent Iterative Refinement Flow (LIRF), a novel
approach that reframes few-shot generation as the progressive densification of
geometrically structured manifold. LIRF establishes a stable latent space using
an autoencoder trained with our novel \textbf{manifold-preservation loss}
$L_{\text{manifold}}$. This loss ensures that the latent space maintains the
geometric and semantic correspondence of the input data. Building on this, we
propose an iterative generate-correct-augment cycle. Within this cycle,
candidate samples are refined by a geometric \textbf{correction operator}, a
provably contractive mapping that pulls samples toward the data manifold while
preserving diversity. We also provide the \textbf{Convergence Theorem}
demonstrating a predictable decrease in Hausdorff distance between generated
and true data manifold. We also demonstrate the framework's scalability by
generating coherent, high-resolution images on AFHQ-Cat. Ablation studies
confirm that both the manifold-preserving latent space and the contractive
correction mechanism are critical components of this success. Ultimately, LIRF
provides a solution for data-scarce generative modeling that is not only
theoretically grounded but also highly effective in practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贡献评估是确保联邦学习公平性和激励参与的关键机制，但现有研究对其脆弱性关注不足。本文旨在揭示贡献分数可能被无意或有意识扭曲的风险。

Method: 通过Flower框架在多样化数据集和模型架构上进行广泛实验，分析不同模型聚合方法对贡献分数的影响，并研究投毒攻击如何策略性操纵模型更新来扭曲贡献评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，聚合方法的选择和攻击者的存在都是扭曲贡献分数的有效途径，高级聚合技术可能无意中显著改变最终分数，而恶意参与者能够通过策略性操纵来夸大自身贡献或贬低他人贡献。

Conclusion: 贡献评估机制存在严重脆弱性，迫切需要开发更鲁棒的评估方案来应对架构敏感性和恶意操纵带来的挑战。

Abstract: This paper investigates the fragility of contribution evaluation in federated
learning, a critical mechanism for ensuring fairness and incentivizing
participation. We argue that contribution scores are susceptible to significant
distortions from two fundamental perspectives: architectural sensitivity and
intentional manipulation. First, we explore how different model aggregation
methods impact these scores. While most research assumes a basic averaging
approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to
handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly
alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning
attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model
updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of
other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously
show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers
are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical
need for more robust evaluation schemes.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基础模型在稀疏奖励强化学习环境中的零样本探索能力，发现视觉语言模型（VLM）虽然能理解高层目标，但在精确控制方面存在"知行差距"，并提出了一个混合框架来探索VLM指导探索的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基础模型在经典RL基准测试中作为零样本探索代理的能力，特别是在稀疏奖励设置下，目前尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 在多臂老虎机、Gridworld和稀疏奖励Atari游戏中测试LLM和VLM的零样本探索能力，并研究一个简单的在线混合框架来弥合"知行差距"。

Result: VLM能够从视觉输入推断高层目标，但在精确低层控制方面持续失败；在理想化设置中，VLM指导能显著提高早期样本效率。

Conclusion: 基础模型更适合用于指导探索而非端到端控制，VLM指导在早期探索阶段具有潜力但存在控制精度限制。

Abstract: Exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging, particularly
in sparse-reward settings. While foundation models possess strong semantic
priors, their capabilities as zero-shot exploration agents in classic RL
benchmarks are not well understood. We benchmark LLMs and VLMs on multi-armed
bandits, Gridworlds, and sparse-reward Atari to test zero-shot exploration. Our
investigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level
objectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level
control: the "knowing-doing gap". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap,
we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case
scenario. Our results in this idealized setting show that VLM guidance can
significantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, providing a clear analysis
of the potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide
exploration rather than for end-to-end control.

Motivation: 探索无需训练的大型语言模型提示方法，用于阿尔茨海默病的早期检测，提高检测的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 使用ADReSS数据集，研究零样本提示和少样本提示（最多每类20个示例），提出两种变体：MMSE-代理提示和推理增强提示。

Result: MMSE-代理提示达到0.82准确率和0.86 AUC；推理增强提示达到0.82准确率和0.83 AUC。

Conclusion: 这是首个将引发概率与MMSE锚定并使用多模态构建提高可解释性的ADReSS研究，为阿尔茨海默病检测提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Prompting large language models is a training-free method for detecting
Alzheimer's disease from speech transcripts. Using the ADReSS dataset, we
revisit zero-shot prompting and study few-shot prompting with a class-balanced
protocol using nested interleave and a strict schema, sweeping up to 20
examples per class. We evaluate two variants achieving state-of-the-art
prompting results. (i) MMSE-Proxy Prompting: each few-shot example carries a
probability anchored to Mini-Mental State Examination bands via a deterministic
mapping, enabling AUC computing; this reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.86 AUC (ii)
Reasoning-augmented Prompting: few-shot examples pool is generated with a
multimodal LLM (GPT-5) that takes as input the Cookie Theft image, transcript,
and MMSE to output a reasoning and MMSE-aligned probability; evaluation remains
transcript-only and reaches 0.82 accuracy and 0.83 AUC. To our knowledge, this
is the first ADReSS study to anchor elicited probabilities to MMSE and to use
multimodal construction to improve interpretability.

Motivation: 机器学习模型经常从训练数据中继承偏见，生成模型虽然有望在数据层面减轻偏见，但现有方法多依赖复杂深度架构，而简单模型在处理表格数据时可能更有效。

Method: 提出TABFAIRGDT方法，使用自回归决策树生成合成数据，通过软叶重采样技术调整决策树输出来减少偏见。该方法是非参数的，能有效处理混合特征类型，无需对底层数据分布做假设。

Result: 在基准公平性数据集上评估表明，TABFAIRGDT优于最先进的深度生成模型，实现了更好的公平性-效用权衡和更高的合成数据质量。方法轻量高效，在标准CPU上仅需1秒即可生成中等规模数据集的公平合成数据，比最快基线提速72%。

Conclusion: TABFAIRGDT为现实世界公平敏感应用提供了一个理想的解决方案，具有高效、轻量和无需数据预处理的优势。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning remains a significant challenge, as
models often inherit biases from their training data. Generative models have
recently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level
while preserving utility. However, many rely on deep architectures, despite
evidence that simpler models can be highly effective for tabular data. In this
work, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic
tabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we
propose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to
reduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is
non-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed
feature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data
distributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models,
achieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as
higher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly
efficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing. Remarkably,
TABFAIRGDT achieves a 72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline across
various dataset sizes, and can generate fair synthetic data for medium-sized
datasets (10 features, 10K samples) in just one second on a standard CPU,
making it an ideal solution for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法存在训练时间长、资源消耗大、对超参数敏感和收敛慢等问题，需要一种更高效的替代方案来学习转移算子的谱分解。

Method: 使用随机神经网络，隐藏层权重随机选择，仅训练输出层。通过闭式解直接表示算子的特征函数，并利用集成学习估计谱性质的不确定性。

Conclusion: RaNNDy框架在保持精度的同时显著提高了训练效率，能够有效计算转移算子的谱分解，但也存在一些局限性需要在未来工作中改进。

Abstract: We propose a randomized neural network approach called RaNNDy for learning
transfer operators and their spectral decompositions from data. The weights of
the hidden layers of the neural network are randomly selected and only the
output layer is trained. The main advantage is that without a noticeable
reduction in accuracy, this approach significantly reduces the training time
and resources while avoiding common problems associated with deep learning such
as sensitivity to hyperparameters and slow convergence. Additionally, the
proposed framework allows us to compute a closed-form solution for the output
layer which directly represents the eigenfunctions of the operator. Moreover,
it is possible to estimate uncertainties associated with the computed spectral
properties via ensemble learning. We present results for different dynamical
operators, including Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, which have
important applications in analyzing the behavior of complex dynamical systems,
and the Schr\"odinger operator. The numerical examples, which highlight the
strengths but also weaknesses of the proposed framework, include several
stochastic dynamical systems, protein folding processes, and the quantum
harmonic oscillator.

Conclusion: LSD和LSD+是有效的离散扩散模型加速方法，通过可学习的采样器蒸馏技术解决了采样效率与质量之间的权衡问题

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models (DDMs) have shown powerful generation ability for
discrete data modalities like text and molecules. However, their practical
application is hindered by inefficient sampling, requiring a large number of
sampling steps. Accelerating DDMs by using larger step sizes typically
introduces significant problems in generation quality, as it amplifies the
impact of both the compounding decoding error due to factorized predictions and
discretization error from numerical approximations, leading to a significant
decrease in sampling quality. To address these challenges, we propose learnable
sampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity
samplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler
with a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of
a high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps. This alignment is achieved
by optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adaptively adjust sampling
dynamics. Additionally, we further propose LSD+, which also learns time
schedules that allocate steps non-uniformly. Experiments across text
generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our proposed
approaches outperform existing samplers for DDMs, achieving substantially
higher sampling quality with significantly fewer sampling steps. Our code is

Motivation: 当前最先进的概率时间序列预测模型依赖采样来表示未来不确定性，但这种方法存在固有局限性，包括缺乏显式概率、覆盖率不足和高计算成本。

Method: 提出了TimePrism模型，仅由三个并行线性层组成，通过直接学习一组合理场景及其对应概率，而不是建模整个连续概率空间。

Result: TimePrism在五个基准数据集上的两个指标中，取得了10个结果中的9个最先进性能。

Conclusion: 概率场景范式展示了超越采样的预测潜力，为预测研究开辟了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting models rely on
sampling to represent future uncertainty. However, this paradigm suffers from
inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate
coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce
\textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address
the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of
\{Scenario, Probability\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation.
To validate this paradigm, we propose \textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model
composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves
9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two
metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing
of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability
space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and
corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the
Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in
forecasting beyond sampling.

TL;DR: OPLoRA是一种内存高效的优化器，通过将LoRA优化转化为可解释的子问题，使用交替最小二乘法更新来缩小LoRA微调与完整训练之间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LoRA通过低秩更新大幅减少了可训练参数和内存使用，但与完整训练（SVDLoRA）之间仍存在性能差距，表明LoRA方法还有改进空间。

Method: 将LoRA优化转化为可解释的子问题，使用交替最小二乘法进行高效更新，1-2次交替步即可接近截断SVD的性能。支持动量机制，内存预算仅为LoRA参数的3倍。

Result: 在线性任务、MNIST、CIFAR-100和RoBERTa-base（MNLI）上，OPLoRA始终接近SVDLoRA的性能，同时使用显著更少的内存。

Conclusion: OPLoRA在保持内存效率的同时，有效缩小了LoRA微调与完整训练之间的性能差距，为大规模模型微调提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank
updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters
and memory. However, there is still a gap between full training with low-rank
projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning, indicating that LoRA steps can be
further improved. In this study, we propose OPLoRA, a memory-efficient
optimizer that closes this gap by casting LoRA optimization as an interpretable
sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates,
where 1-2 alternating steps are empirically found to be sufficient to closely
match truncated SVD without ever forming the full matrix. We also retrieve the
recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as a special case. OPLoRA
supports momentum by maintaining a low-rank estimate using the same subroutine
(LoRSum) for computing the step, with a memory budget of 3 times the number of
LoRA parameters (i.e., same as Adam). We also propose an experimental scaled
variant that uses the K-FAC metric, which could be of interest. Across a linear

SVDLoRA's performance using significantly less memory.

TL;DR: 提出了RAD框架，通过检索增强机制显式注入外部医学知识到多模态模型中，提升临床诊断的准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI医学研究主要依赖模型参数中隐式编码的知识，忽视了不同下游任务所需的特定知识，限制了诊断性能

Method: RAD框架包含三个关键机制：从多医学源检索和精炼疾病中心知识、指南增强对比损失约束多模态特征与指南知识距离、双Transformer解码器使用指南作为查询引导跨模态融合

Result: 在四个不同解剖结构数据集上的广泛评估显示RAD具有良好泛化性，达到最先进性能，并能更精确关注异常区域和关键指标

Conclusion: RAD框架能够实现基于证据的可信诊断，与临床诊断工作流程保持一致，为多模态诊断模型提供了可解释性评估标准

Abstract: Clinical diagnosis is a highly specialized discipline requiring both domain
expertise and strict adherence to rigorous guidelines. While current AI-driven
medical research predominantly focuses on knowledge graphs or natural text
pretraining paradigms to incorporate medical knowledge, these approaches
primarily rely on implicitly encoded knowledge within model parameters,
neglecting task-specific knowledge required by diverse downstream tasks. To
address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis (RAD), a
novel framework that explicitly injects external knowledge into multimodal
models directly on downstream tasks. Specifically, RAD operates through three
key mechanisms: retrieval and refinement of disease-centered knowledge from
multiple medical sources, a guideline-enhanced contrastive loss that constrains
the latent distance between multi-modal features and guideline knowledge, and
the dual transformer decoder that employs guidelines as queries to steer
cross-modal fusion, aligning the models with clinical diagnostic workflows from
guideline acquisition to feature extraction and decision-making. Moreover,
recognizing the lack of quantitative evaluation of interpretability for
multimodal diagnostic models, we introduce a set of criteria to assess the
interpretability from both image and text perspectives. Extensive evaluations
across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate RAD's
generalizability, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, RAD
enables the model to concentrate more precisely on abnormal regions and
critical indicators, ensuring evidence-based, trustworthy diagnosis. Our code

*Sepehr Maleki,Negar Pourmoazemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pi-Transformer是一种物理信息Transformer模型，通过双注意力路径（数据驱动的序列注意力和编码时间不变量的先验注意力）来检测多元时间序列中的异常，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列中的异常通常源于时间上下文和跨通道协调，而非孤立离群点。现有方法缺乏对物理规律的编码，难以有效检测时序和相位相关的异常。

Method: 提出双注意力路径：数据驱动的序列注意力和编码时间不变量的先验注意力。训练时结合重构目标和散度项，鼓励两个注意力一致但保持差异；先验注意力被正则化以平滑演化。推理时融合对齐加权重构信号和失配信号。

Result: 在SMD、MSL、SMAP、SWaT和PSM五个基准测试中达到最先进或极具竞争力的F1分数，在时序和相位破坏异常检测方面表现突出。案例分析显示两个流具有互补行为。

Conclusion: 将物理信息先验嵌入注意力机制，为复杂多元系统中的异常检测提供了一种校准且鲁棒的方法。

Abstract: Anomalies in multivariate time series often arise from temporal context and
cross-channel coordination rather than isolated outliers. We present
Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a
data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that
encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase
synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction
error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence
term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them
meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is
lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model
combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch
signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a
single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and
PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with
particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show
complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around
regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a
calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate
systems. Code is publicly available at this GitHub
repository\footnote{https://github.com/sepehr-m/Pi-Transformer}.

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一种新的表示学习范式，利用扩散过程驱动对比目标，创建具有强类别可分性的噪声不变嵌入。

Abstract: Learning robust representations for biosignals is often hampered by the
challenge of designing effective data augmentations.Traditional methods can
fail to capture the complex variations inherent in physiological data. Within
this context, we propose a novel hybrid framework, Diffusion-Augmented
Contrastive Learning (DACL), that fuses concepts from diffusion models and
supervised contrastive learning. The DACL framework operates on a latent space
created by a lightweight Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on our novel
Scattering Transformer (ST) features [12]. It utilizes the diffusion forward
process as a principled data augmentation technique to generate multiple noisy
views of these latent embeddings. A U-Net style encoder is then trained with a
supervised contrastive objective to learn a representation that balances class
discrimination with robustness to noise across various diffusion time steps. We
evaluated this proof-of-concept method on the PhysioNet 2017 ECG dataset,
achieving a competitive AUROC of 0.7815. This work establishes a new paradigm
for representation learning by using the diffusion process itself to drive the
contrastive objective, creating noise-invariant embeddings that demonstrate a
strong foundation for class separability.

Conclusion: 渗透测试任务极大受益于历史聚合，这种方法能开发出更鲁棒和可迁移的策略，对于在多样且不可预测的现实环境中确保可靠性能至关重要。

Abstract: Penetration testing, the simulation of cyberattacks to identify security
vulnerabilities, presents a sequential decision-making problem well-suited for
reinforcement learning (RL) automation. Like many applications of RL to
real-world problems, partial observability presents a major challenge, as it
invalidates the Markov property present in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).
Partially Observable MDPs require history aggregation or belief state
estimation to learn successful policies. We investigate stochastic, partially
observable penetration testing scenarios over host networks of varying size,
aiming to better reflect real-world complexity through more challenging and
representative benchmarks. This approach leads to the development of more
robust and transferable policies, which are crucial for ensuring reliable
performance across diverse and unpredictable real-world environments. Using
vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a baseline, we compare a
selection of PPO variants designed to mitigate partial observability, including
frame-stacking, augmenting observations with historical information, and
employing recurrent or transformer-based architectures. We conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of these algorithms across different host network sizes. We
find that this task greatly benefits from history aggregation. Converging three
times faster than other approaches. Manual inspection of the learned policies
by the algorithms reveals clear distinctions and provides insights that go
beyond quantitative results.

Abstract: Estimating hidden states in dynamical systems, also known as optimal
filtering, is a long-standing problem in various fields of science and
engineering. In this paper, we introduce a general filtering framework,
\textbf{LLM-Filter}, which leverages large language models (LLMs) for state
estimation by embedding noisy observations with text prototypes. In various
experiments for classical dynamical systems, we find that first, state
estimation can significantly benefit from the reasoning knowledge embedded in
pre-trained LLMs. By achieving proper modality alignment with the frozen LLM,
LLM-Filter outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Second,
we carefully design the prompt structure, System-as-Prompt (SaP), incorporating
task instructions that enable the LLM to understand the estimation tasks.
Guided by these prompts, LLM-Filter exhibits exceptional generalization,
capable of performing filtering tasks accurately in changed or even unseen
environments. We further observe a scaling-law behavior in LLM-Filter, where
accuracy improves with larger model sizes and longer training times. These
findings make LLM-Filter a promising foundation model of filtering.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了高维低数据量场景下的关联规则挖掘问题，为生物医学等领域的高维数据分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Association Rule Mining (ARM) aims to discover patterns between features in
datasets in the form of propositional rules, supporting both knowledge
discovery and interpretable machine learning in high-stakes decision-making.
However, in high-dimensional settings, rule explosion and computational
overhead render popular algorithmic approaches impractical without effective
search space reduction, challenges that propagate to downstream tasks.
Neurosymbolic methods, such as Aerial+, have recently been proposed to address
the rule explosion in ARM. While they tackle the high dimensionality of the
data, they also inherit limitations of neural networks, particularly reduced
performance in low-data regimes.
  This paper makes three key contributions to association rule discovery in
high-dimensional tabular data. First, we empirically show that Aerial+ scales
one to two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art algorithmic and
neurosymbolic baselines across five real-world datasets. Second, we introduce
the novel problem of ARM in high-dimensional, low-data settings, such as gene
expression data from the biomedicine domain with around 18k features and 50
samples. Third, we propose two fine-tuning approaches to Aerial+ using tabular
foundation models. Our proposed approaches are shown to significantly improve
rule quality on five real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in
low-data, high-dimensional scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出Yomo方法，通过概率聚合机制替代Pauli期望值输出，实现量子机器学习模型在单次测量下的准确推理，大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量子机器学习模型依赖大量重复测量来获得可靠预测，导致高昂的推理成本和时间开销，阻碍了QML的实际应用。

Method: Yomo采用概率聚合机制替代Pauli期望值输出，并引入鼓励锐利预测的损失函数，避免了基于期望值模型的测量次数限制。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，Yomo在不同测量预算和去极化信道模拟下均优于基线方法，实现了准确的单次测量推理。

Conclusion: Yomo通过大幅减少测量次数，显著降低了QML部署的财务和计算成本，为QML的实际应用降低了门槛。

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) models conventionally rely on repeated
measurements (shots) of observables to obtain reliable predictions. This
dependence on large shot budgets leads to high inference cost and time
overhead, which is particularly problematic as quantum hardware access is
typically priced proportionally to the number of shots. In this work we propose
You Only Measure Once (Yomo), a simple yet effective design that achieves
accurate inference with dramatically fewer measurements, down to the
single-shot regime. Yomo replaces Pauli expectation-value outputs with a
probability aggregation mechanism and introduces loss functions that encourage
sharp predictions. Our theoretical analysis shows that Yomo avoids the
shot-scaling limitations inherent to expectation-based models, and our
experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm that Yomo consistently outperforms
baselines across different shot budgets and under simulations with depolarizing
channels. By enabling accurate single-shot inference, Yomo substantially
reduces the financial and computational costs of deploying QML, thereby
lowering the barrier to practical adoption of QML.

Abstract: Learning physical dynamics from data is a fundamental challenge in machine
learning and scientific modeling. Real-world observational data are inherently
incomplete and irregularly sampled, posing significant challenges for existing
data-driven approaches. In this work, we propose a principled diffusion-based
framework for learning physical systems from incomplete training samples. To
this end, our method strategically partitions each such sample into observed
context and unobserved query components through a carefully designed splitting
strategy, then trains a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct the missing
query portions given available contexts. This formulation enables accurate
imputation across arbitrary observation patterns without requiring complete
data supervision. Specifically, we provide theoretical analysis demonstrating
that our diffusion training paradigm on incomplete data achieves asymptotic
convergence to the true complete generative process under mild regularity
conditions. Empirically, we show that our method significantly outperforms
existing baselines on synthetic and real-world physical dynamics benchmarks,
including fluid flows and weather systems, with particularly strong performance
in limited and irregular observation regimes. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our theoretically principled approach for learning and
imputing partially observed dynamics.

Motivation: 由于异常标签稀缺且人工标注成本高，基于重构的无监督方法受到关注。但现有方法仅依赖逐点距离度量，忽略了时间序列的结构特征，难以处理复杂的模式异常。

Method: StrAD在重构模型的优化目标中融入趋势、季节性和形状等结构信息，通过结构感知的优化机制确保原始数据与重构数据在结构特征上对齐，保持全局波动和局部特征的一致性。

Conclusion: StrAD提出的结构感知优化机制是即插即用的，适用于任何基于重构的方法，增强了模型对点异常和模式异常的敏感性。

Abstract: Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial
applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and
the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches
have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection
remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of
reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures,
ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus
failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose
StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the
optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the
time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture
such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape
in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent
structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time
series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can
assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in
terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation
and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any
reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both
point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that
StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models
across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.

Abstract: We study \emph{online episodic Constrained Markov Decision Processes} (CMDPs)
under both stochastic and adversarial constraints. We provide a novel algorithm
whose guarantees greatly improve those of the state-of-the-art
best-of-both-worlds algorithm introduced by Stradi et al. (2025). In the
stochastic regime, \emph{i.e.}, when the constraints are sampled from fixed but
unknown distributions, our method achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$
regret and constraint violation without relying on Slater's condition, thereby
handling settings where no strictly feasible solution exists. Moreover, we
provide guarantees on the stronger notion of \emph{positive} constraint
violation, which does not allow to recover from large violation in the early
episodes by playing strictly safe policies. In the adversarial regime,
\emph{i.e.}, when the constraints may change arbitrarily between episodes, our
algorithm ensures sublinear constraint violation without Slater's condition,
and achieves sublinear $\alpha$-regret with respect to the \emph{unconstrained}
optimum, where $\alpha$ is a suitably defined multiplicative approximation
factor. We further validate our results through synthetic experiments, showing
the practical effectiveness of our algorithm.

TL;DR: 本文提出Q-Palette，一种用于大语言模型权重后训练量化的分数位量化器集合，通过理论推导最优位分配并实现混合方案量化框架，以解决LLM权重分布不规则和重尾异常值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型权重分布不规则且存在重尾异常值，使得量化变得复杂。旋转方法虽然能将权重转换为近似高斯分布，但需要精细的分数位量化器来接近高斯失真率界限以实现最优量化性能。

Conclusion: Q-Palette通过理论指导的分数位量化器和混合方案框架，有效解决了LLM权重量化的挑战，为边缘设备上的个性化推理提供了实用的量化解决方案。

Abstract: We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the
weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no
calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint
and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference
scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its
importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs
complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that
transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with
fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first
derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized
weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit
quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to
achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical
insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile
collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded
quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar
quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with
optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging
Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme
quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion
decisions given resource constraints. The code is available at

Abstract: The embedding space of language models is widely believed to capture the
semantic relationships; for instance, embeddings of digits often exhibit an
ordered structure that corresponds to their natural sequence. However, the
mechanisms driving the formation of such structures remain poorly understood.
In this work, we interpret the embedding structures via the data distribution.
We propose a set of probability signatures that reflect the semantic
relationships among tokens. Through experiments on the composite addition tasks
using the linear model and feedforward network, combined with theoretical
analysis of gradient flow dynamics, we reveal that these probability signatures
significantly influence the embedding structures. We further generalize our
analysis to large language models (LLMs) by training the Qwen2.5 architecture
on the subsets of the Pile corpus. Our results show that the probability
signatures are faithfully aligned with the embedding structures, particularly
in capturing strong pairwise similarities among embeddings. Our work uncovers
the mechanism of how data distribution guides the formation of embedding
structures, establishing a novel understanding of the relationship between
embedding organization and semantic patterns.

Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法虽然表面上成功删除了敏感知识，但这些信息仍可通过再学习攻击被轻易恢复，暴露了实际知识移除与表面遗忘之间的鲁棒性差距。

Method: 提出StableUN双级反馈优化框架，通过邻域感知优化寻找稳定参数区域。集成遗忘反馈（使用对抗扰动探测参数邻域）和记忆反馈（保持模型效用），通过梯度投影对齐两个目标。

Result: 在WMDP和MUSE基准测试中，该方法对再学习和越狱攻击表现出显著更强的鲁棒性，同时保持竞争力的效用性能。

Conclusion: StableUN框架有效解决了LLM遗忘方法的安全漏洞问题，通过寻找更稳定的参数区域，实现了真正的知识移除而不仅仅是表面遗忘。

Abstract: Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that
undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove
sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten" information remains
precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root
cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual
data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss
landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can
drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks
exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate
the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly
recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical
robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To
address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided
optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via
neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses
adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering
feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through
gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that
our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and
jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.

Abstract: Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct class-representative
samples from trained models. Recent generative MIAs utilize generative
adversarial networks to learn image priors that guide the inversion process,
yielding reconstructions with high visual quality and strong fidelity to the
private training data. To explore the reason behind their effectiveness, we
begin by examining the gradients of inversion loss with respect to synthetic
inputs, and find that these gradients are surprisingly noisy. Further analysis
reveals that generative inversion implicitly denoises these gradients by
projecting them onto the tangent space of the generator manifold, filtering out
off-manifold components while preserving informative directions aligned with
the manifold. Our empirical measurements show that, in models trained with
standard supervision, loss gradients often exhibit large angular deviations
from the data manifold, indicating poor alignment with class-relevant
directions. This observation motivates our central hypothesis: models become
more vulnerable to MIAs when their loss gradients align more closely with the
generator manifold. We validate this hypothesis by designing a novel training
objective that explicitly promotes such alignment. Building on this insight, we
further introduce a training-free approach to enhance gradient-manifold
alignment during inversion, leading to consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art generative MIAs.

Abstract: Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play pivotal roles in gene expression regulation and
the pathogenesis of various diseases. Accurate classification of ncRNAs is
essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing
limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose
HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which
integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression
features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the
sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM
architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies
of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer
(MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics
of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev
Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and
interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating
virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction,
HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel
heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets
demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies
further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong
transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA
functional classification. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出FairEquityFL框架，用于在动态异构车联网环境中实现联邦学习的公平客户端选择，通过采样均衡器和异常检测机制确保所有客户端获得公平参与机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习框架在车联网应用中缺乏对客户端选择公平性的考虑，特别是在动态异构环境中，需要确保所有客户端获得平等的训练参与机会。

Method: 设计FairEquityFL框架，包含采样均衡器模块确保公平协作机会，以及异常检测机制识别恶意客户端。选择器负责监控和控制客户端参与，临时暂停可疑客户端。

Result: 在FEMNIST数据集上的仿真结果表明，FairEquityFL在性能上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: FairEquityFL框架有效解决了车联网环境中联邦学习的客户端选择公平性问题，为动态异构环境下的联邦学习应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has been extensively employed for a number of
applications in machine learning, i.e., primarily owing to its privacy
preserving nature and efficiency in mitigating the communication overhead.
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is one of the promising applications, wherein FL can
be utilized to train a model more efficiently. Since only a subset of the
clients can participate in each FL training round, challenges arise pertinent
to fairness in the client selection process. Over the years, a number of
researchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL
frameworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed
fairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV
environment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework
to ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL
training process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module
within the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair
collaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process.
The selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling
the clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier
detection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the
model performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or
loss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily
suspend such clients from participating in the FL training process. We further
evaluate the performance of FairEquityFL on a publicly available dataset,
FEMNIST. Our simulation results depict that FairEquityFL outperforms baseline
models to a considerable extent.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了PGCLODA框架，一种基于提示引导图对比学习的方法，用于预测寡肽与传染病之间的关联关系，在多个评估指标上优于现有最优模型。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传染病对公共卫生构成严重威胁，迫切需要有效的计算方法筛选新型抗感染药物。寡肽因其结构简单、生物利用度高和耐药性低而成为有前景的候选药物，但专门预测寡肽与传染病关联的计算模型仍然稀缺。

Conclusion: PGCLODA为机制驱动的发现和基于寡肽的药物开发提供了有价值的见解，能够揭示具有生物学意义的新型关联关系。

Abstract: Infectious diseases continue to pose a serious threat to public health,
underscoring the urgent need for effective computational approaches to screen
novel anti-infective agents. Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates
in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high
bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential,
computational models specifically designed to predict associations between
oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a
prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover
potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides,
microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic
information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a
prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful
paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global
features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a
benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and
hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies
further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to
uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer
valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug
development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at

TL;DR: 本文提出几何感知的输入噪声方法，通过考虑数据流形的底层结构来改进模型泛化能力，相比传统环境噪声方法在高度弯曲流形上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法只在输入空间添加环境噪声，没有考虑数据的底层流形结构。本文旨在开发能够利用数据几何结构的噪声添加方法。

Method: 提出两种几何感知噪声方法：1）将高斯噪声投影到流形切空间，然后通过测地线映射到流形上；2）在流形上使用布朗运动噪声进行随机移动。

Result: 在高度弯曲流形上，几何感知噪声显著提升泛化能力和超参数选择鲁棒性；在简单流形上至少与无噪声训练相当。

Conclusion: 几何感知噪声框架能有效利用数据流形结构，为学习数据流形提供可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: It has been shown that perturbing the input during training implicitly
regularises the gradient of the learnt function, leading to smoother models and
enhancing generalisation. However, previous research mostly considered the
addition of ambient noise in the input space, without considering the
underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose several methods of
adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts for the lower dimensional
manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting ambient Gaussian
noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step, the noise
sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We also
consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold.
We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalization and
robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while
performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our
proposed framework extends to learned data manifolds.

TL;DR: LLM-judged benchmarks存在设计缺陷，会产生大量噪声而非真实排名。本文提出两种诊断机制来量化基准测试的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM-judged benchmarks被广泛用于评估复杂模型行为，其设计缺陷可能导致高置信度但实际上是噪声的排名结果，需要可靠的方法来诊断这些问题。

Method: 提出两种诊断机制：1）Schematic adherence量化评判者偏离明确评估标准的程度；2）Psychometric validity聚合内部一致性和区分效度信号来量化基准测试的不可约不确定性。

Result: 在Arena-Hard Auto基准测试中发现严重问题：DeepSeek-R1-32B的未解释方差超过90%，大多数标准的因子相关性高于0.93，ELO式聚合方法掩盖了真实的排名不确定性。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM-judged benchmarks的设计失败，提出了构建更好范围、可靠性感知的基准测试的可操作原则。

Abstract: LLM-judged benchmarks are increasingly used to evaluate complex model
behaviors, yet their design introduces failure modes absent in conventional
ground-truth based benchmarks. We argue that without tight objectives and
verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence
rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to
diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's
overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing
unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric
validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to
quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools
to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse
across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent
for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We
also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and
masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that
undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped,
reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks. We release our code at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中数据分布会发生变化（如传感器漂移、光照变化），单一静态模型无法适应这种动态变化，需要持续模型自适应

Method: 先用反向传播离线训练深度神经网络获得高性能初始模型，然后用预测编码进行在线自适应，恢复因输入数据分布变化而损失的准确率

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，该混合策略能够以较低计算开销实现有效自适应

Conclusion: 该方法结合了反向传播的鲁棒性和预测编码的计算效率，为动态环境中维持模型性能提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world
environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes
in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations
necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by
combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method
begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to
achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed
for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to
shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness
of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational
efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly
well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic
accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a
reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining
model performance in dynamic environments.

Result: 在估计和计算性能方面表现出色，并在两个真实世界数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在获得可靠解释方面具有潜力，解决了do-SHAP在复杂图上的可行性问题。

Abstract: Among explainability techniques, SHAP stands out as one of the most popular,
but often overlooks the causal structure of the problem. In response, do-SHAP
employs interventional queries, but its reliance on estimands hinders its
practical application. To address this problem, we propose the use of
estimand-agnostic approaches, which allow for the estimation of any
identifiable query from a single model, making do-SHAP feasible on complex
graphs. We also develop a novel algorithm to significantly accelerate its
computation at a negligible cost, as well as a method to explain inaccessible
Data Generating Processes. We demonstrate the estimation and computational
performance of our approach, and validate it on two real-world datasets,
highlighting its potential in obtaining reliable explanations.

Conclusion: 视频模型正朝着统一的通用视觉基础模型方向发展，其涌现的零样本能力表明这一技术路径的可行性。

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified,
generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple
primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the
same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be
on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs
developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can
solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting
objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties,
recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities
to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of
visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot
capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified,
generalist vision foundation models.

Conclusion: T-HénonNets成功扩展了HénonNets的能力，能够处理自适应时间步长和非自治系统，但在处理非可分离哈密顿系统方面存在挑战。

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly, i.e., not on equidistant time
grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine
learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [1] and
H\'enonNets [2] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To
learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets called
TSympNets is introduced in [3]. The aim of this work is to do a similar
extension for H\'enonNets. We propose a novel neural network architecture
called T-H\'enonNets, which is symplectic by design and can handle adaptive
time steps. We also extend the T-H\'enonNet architecture to non-autonomous
Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide universal approximation theorems
for both new architectures for separable Hamiltonian systems and discuss why it
is difficult to handle non-separable Hamiltonian systems with the proposed
methods. To investigate these theoretical approximation capabilities, we
perform different numerical experiments.

Abstract: Transformer-based LLMs demonstrate strong performance on graph reasoning
tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain underexplored. To uncover these

basic decoder-only transformers and explain them using the circuit-tracer
framework. Through this lens, we visualize reasoning traces and identify two
core mechanisms in graph reasoning: token merging and structural memorization,
which underlie both path reasoning and substructure extraction tasks. We
further quantify these behaviors and analyze how they are influenced by graph
density and model size. Our study provides a unified interpretability framework
for understanding structural reasoning in decoder-only Transformers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于token吞吐量的自下而上方法，用于估算大规模LLM系统的每查询能耗，发现前沿模型在现实负载下每查询能耗中位数为0.34Wh，而非生产环境估算可能高估4-20倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI推理规模达到数十亿查询，以及新兴推理和代理工作流程增加token需求，可靠的每查询能耗估算对于容量规划、排放核算和效率优先级排序变得越来越重要。

Method: 采用自下而上的方法，基于token吞吐量估算大规模LLM系统的每查询能耗，考虑了GPU利用率、PUE约束等现实工作负载条件。

Result: 前沿模型（>2000亿参数）在H100节点上运行时，每查询能耗中位数为0.34Wh（IQR：0.18-0.67）。当每个典型查询的token数量增加15倍时，能耗上升13倍至4.32Wh。通过模型、服务平台和硬件层面的效率提升，可实现1.5-3.5倍的个体能耗降低，综合改进可达8-20倍的降低。

Conclusion: 针对长查询场景的效率优化将带来最大的全系统节能效果，通过有针对性的效率干预，可以将10亿查询部署的每日能耗从1.8GWh降低到0.9GWh，与同等规模的网络搜索能耗相当。

Abstract: As AI inference scales to billions of queries and emerging reasoning and
agentic workflows increase token demand, reliable estimates of per-query energy
use are increasingly important for capacity planning, emissions accounting, and
efficiency prioritization. Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate
energy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to
reflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce
a bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM
systems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under
realistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median
energy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200
billion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using
production-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and
assumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling
scenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x
to 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver
the largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the
model, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median
reductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can
plausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we
estimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion
queries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8
GWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day,
similar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how
data centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains
during the internet and cloud build-up.

Conclusion: 结合结构化滞后、发票级闭合建模和行为洞察，能够显著提升稀疏金融时间序列预测的准确性，为相关领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting in the e-commerce finance domain is particularly
challenging due to irregular invoice schedules, payment deferrals, and
user-specific behavioral variability. These factors, combined with sparse
datasets and short historical windows, limit the effectiveness of conventional
time-series methods. While deep learning and Transformer-based models have
shown promise in other domains, their performance deteriorates under partial
observability and limited historical data. To address these challenges, we
propose a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates dynamic lagged feature
engineering and adaptive rolling-window representations with classical
statistical models and ensemble learners. Our approach explicitly incorporates
invoice-level behavioral modeling, structured lag of support data, and custom
stability-aware loss functions, enabling robust forecasts in sparse and
irregular financial settings. Empirical results demonstrate an approximate 5%
reduction in MAPE compared to baseline models, translating into substantial
financial savings. Furthermore, the framework enhances forecast stability over
quarterly horizons and strengthens feature target correlation by capturing both
short- and long-term patterns, leveraging user profile attributes, and
simulating upcoming invoice behaviors. These findings underscore the value of
combining structured lagging, invoice-level closure modeling, and behavioral
insights to advance predictive accuracy in sparse financial time-series
forecasting.

Conclusion: 参考无关方法在在线和离线偏好学习中面临不同挑战，SimPO在离线设置成功而最大熵RL在在线设置失败的原因需要进一步探讨。

Abstract: In this paper, we show that Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) can be
derived as Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with length-normalized
temperature, providing a theoretical foundation for this reference-free method.
Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we
investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online
RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently
exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning
rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy
regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with
overoptimization. Lastly, we discuss possible explanations for why SimPO
succeeds in offline settings while Maximum Entropy RL struggles in online
scenarios. Our findings suggest that reference-free approaches may face
distinct challenges when applied to online or offline preference learning.

Motivation: 预测微观结构如何控制异质材料的力学响应对于优化设计和性能至关重要，但由于微观结构特征的高维复杂性，传统物理模拟计算成本过高，需要开发高效的计算工具来学习结构-性能关系。

Method: 采用规范多分量张量分解（canonical polyadic tensor decomposition），通过自适应引入更高秩项，将高维微观结构信息高效映射到局部弹性响应。

Result: xLRA仅需最大秩为4即可准确预测多孔微结构的局部弹性应变场，仅使用5%的数据集训练即可实现准确预测，计算效率比现有方法高6个数量级。

Conclusion: xLRA提供了一个高效框架，能够从微观结构预测弹性响应，实现结构-性能关系的可扩展映射，在预测精度、泛化能力和计算效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Predicting how the microstructure governs the mechanical response of
heterogeneous materials is essential for optimizing design and performance. Yet
this task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of
microstructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the
microstructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the
development of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property
linkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven
approaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To
address this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation
(xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It
efficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local
elastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately
predicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a
maximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate
predictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant
data efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results
across representative material systems, including two phase composites and
single and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains
essential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen
microstructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods
in predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while
requiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary,
xLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from
microstructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.

### [192] [Alignment-Sensitive Minimax Rates for Spectral Algorithms with Learned Kernels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20294)
*Dongming Huang,Zhifan Li,Yicheng Li,Qian Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了有效跨度维度（ESD）这一新的复杂度度量，用于分析从数据中学习核函数的光谱算法。ESD能够联合考虑信号、谱和噪声水平，无需特征值衰减或源条件假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定核理论无法充分解释从数据中学习核函数时的泛化性能，需要一种新的框架来理解自适应特征学习如何改善光谱算法的泛化能力。

Method: 引入有效跨度维度（ESD）作为复杂度度量，分析序列模型、线性模型和RKHS回归中的光谱算法性能，并通过梯度流分析证明ESD的可减少性。

Result: 证明了当ESD不超过K时，最小最大超额风险按σ²K缩放；梯度流能够降低ESD，这建立了自适应特征学习与泛化改进之间的联系。

Conclusion: ESD框架为超越传统固定核理论提供了新的泛化视角，通过数值实验验证了理论的通用性，揭示了特征学习对光谱算法性能的积极影响。

Abstract: We study spectral algorithms in the setting where kernels are learned from
data. We introduce the effective span dimension (ESD), an alignment-sensitive
complexity measure that depends jointly on the signal, spectrum, and noise
level $\sigma^2$. The ESD is well-defined for arbitrary kernels and signals
without requiring eigen-decay conditions or source conditions. We prove that
for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as
$\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and
prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between
adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of
spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by
extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory
with numerical experiments. This framework provides a novel perspective on
generalization beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories.

*Om Roy,Yashar Moshfeghi,Keith Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了图变量神经网络（GVNNs），这是一种基于图变量信号分析（GVSA）框架的新型神经网络层，用于处理动态演化的时空信号。GVNNs通过将时空信号与信号相关的连接张量进行卷积，结合了稳定的长期支持和瞬时的数据驱动交互，无需使用滑动窗口即可捕捉动态统计依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络（GNNs）通常假设存在一个固定的底层图结构，但在许多实际应用中，这种结构可能不存在或需要从信号中独立推导。为了解决动态演化时空信号的建模挑战，作者提出了GVNNs，旨在构建一个统一的框架，能够处理随时间变化的功能性网络。

Method: GVNNs基于GVSA框架，利用图信号处理工具，将时空信号与信号相关的连接张量进行卷积。该连接张量结合了稳定的长期支持和瞬时的数据驱动交互，从而在每个时间步捕捉动态统计依赖关系。该方法具有线性复杂度的高效实现。

Result: 在预测基准测试中，GVNNs consistently outperformed strong graph-based baselines and were competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieved strong accuracy, highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.

Conclusion: GVNNs提供了一种有效的框架，用于建模动态演化的时空信号，无需依赖固定的图结构或使用滑动窗口。该方法在多个基准测试中表现出色，尤其在脑机接口应用中显示出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent
challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an
existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not
always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving
functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph
Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a
network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support
usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from
graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs):
layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent
connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous,
data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical
interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits
an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across
forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based
baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs
and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong
accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface
applications.

*Sara Fridovich-Keil,Mert Pilanci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了ReLU神经网络稀疏恢复的首个保证，提出了一种基于迭代硬阈值算法的稀疏权重恢复方法，内存使用与稀疏权重数量线性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络稀疏权重恢复的理论保证，解决现有方法内存效率低的问题，为稀疏神经网络的实际应用提供理论基础。

Method: 使用简单的迭代硬阈值算法，分析两层标量输出网络的稀疏权重结构特性，在满足特定结构条件下实现精确权重恢复。

Result: 理论分析表明算法能精确恢复稀疏权重，实验验证在稀疏种植MLP、MNIST分类和隐式神经表示等任务上表现优异，性能与高内存消耗的迭代幅度剪枝基线相当甚至更好。

Conclusion: 该方法为稀疏神经网络权重恢复提供了首个理论保证，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了内存效率，具有重要的理论和实践意义。

Abstract: We prove the first guarantees of sparse recovery for ReLU neural networks,
where the sparse network weights constitute the signal to be recovered.
Specifically, we study structural properties of the sparse network weights for
two-layer, scalar-output networks under which a simple iterative hard
thresholding algorithm recovers these weights exactly, using memory that grows
linearly in the number of nonzero weights. We validate this theoretical result
with simple experiments on recovery of sparse planted MLPs, MNIST
classification, and implicit neural representations. Experimentally, we find
performance that is competitive with, and often exceeds, a high-performing but
memory-inefficient baseline based on iterative magnitude pruning.

*Tianyu Ruan,Kuo Gai,Shihua Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了深度网络泛化能力的原因，通过分析内部特征的时间演化，发现了一种时间一致性现象：早期检查点的浅层特征与后期深层特征组合时预测保持稳定，这种稳定性作为隐式结构化增强支持泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索深度网络为何具有良好泛化能力这一基本问题，区别于经典泛化理论，通过研究内部特征的演化过程来理解泛化机制。

Method: 分析深度网络训练过程中内部特征的时间演化，研究不同检查点特征的组合稳定性，使用统计测试分析SGD注入的噪声特性。

Result: 发现时间一致性现象，预测在特征组合时保持稳定；这种稳定性延伸到未见和损坏数据，但在语义结构被破坏时崩溃；SGD注入各向异性噪声，与少数主方向对齐。

Conclusion: 时间一致性作为隐式结构化增强支持泛化，特征动态与泛化能力存在概念联系，为未来开发测量时间特征演化的实用替代指标指明方向。

Abstract: Why do deep networks generalize well? In contrast to classical generalization
theory, we approach this fundamental question by examining not only inputs and
outputs, but the evolution of internal features. Our study suggests a
phenomenon of temporal consistency that predictions remain stable when shallow
features from earlier checkpoints combine with deeper features from later ones.
This stability is not a trivial convergence artifact. It acts as a form of
implicit, structured augmentation that supports generalization. We show that
temporal consistency extends to unseen and corrupted data, but collapses when
semantic structure is destroyed (e.g., random labels). Statistical tests
further reveal that SGD injects anisotropic noise aligned with a few principal
directions, reinforcing its role as a source of structured variability.
Together, these findings suggest a conceptual perspective that links feature
dynamics to generalization, pointing toward future work on practical surrogates
for measuring temporal feature evolution.

*Mohsen Nayebi Kerdabadi,William Andrew Byron,Xin Sun,Amirfarrokh Iranitalab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATLAS框架通过将账户盗用检测重新定义为时空有向图上的节点分类问题，利用图神经网络捕捉会话间的关联性和时序模式，显著提升了检测性能并减少了用户摩擦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于梯度提升决策树的ATO检测系统独立评分会话，忽略了在线活动的关联性和时序结构，无法有效检测协调攻击和欺诈团伙。

Method: ATLAS框架构建时间尊重有向会话图，通过共享标识符（账户、设备、IP）连接实体，使用时窗和最近性约束调节连接性，采用因果时间尊重消息传递和延迟感知标签传播。

Result: 在Capital One的高风险数字产品上，ATLAS实现了6.38%的AUC提升和超过50%的用户摩擦减少，提高了欺诈捕获率。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过图神经网络方法有效解决了ATO检测中的关联性和时序建模问题，在保持低延迟的同时显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Account Takeover (ATO) fraud poses a significant challenge in consumer
banking, requiring high recall under strict latency while minimizing friction
for legitimate users. Production systems typically rely on tabular
gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions
independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online
activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and "fraud rings." We introduce
ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a
framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node
classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links
entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates
connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal,
time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses
only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We
operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor
sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B
edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38
percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer
friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了过程信息预测(PIF)模型，用于制药冻干过程中的温度预测，通过整合过程信息的轨迹先验，在准确性、物理一致性和噪声鲁棒性方面优于纯数据驱动模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在复杂物理系统的时间序列预测中表现出色，但由于物理不一致性和鲁棒性问题，在受监管环境中的部署受到限制。需要开发既准确又物理可靠的预测方法。

Method: 研究了从经典模型(ARIMA、ETS)到现代深度学习架构(KANs)的多种模型，比较了三种整合过程信息轨迹先验的损失函数：固定权重损失、动态不确定性损失和残差注意力机制。

Result: PIF模型在准确性、物理合理性和噪声弹性方面均优于纯数据驱动模型，并在新过程的迁移学习场景中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为制药制造关键应用开发可靠且可泛化的预测解决方案提供了路线图，证明了过程信息整合在提高预测模型可靠性方面的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate time-series forecasting for complex physical systems is the backbone
of modern industrial monitoring and control. While deep learning models excel
at capturing complex dynamics, currently, their deployment is limited due to
physical inconsistency and robustness, hence constraining their reliability in
regulated environments. We introduce process-informed forecasting (PIF) models
for temperature in pharmaceutical lyophilization. We investigate a wide range
of models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
Model (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning
architectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three
different loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed
trajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a
Residual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism. We evaluate all models not only for
accuracy and physical consistency but also for robustness to sensor noise.
Furthermore, we test the practical generalizability of the best model in a
transfer learning scenario on a new process. Our results show that PIF models
outperform their data-driven counterparts in terms of accuracy, physical
plausibility and noise resilience. This work provides a roadmap for developing
reliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical applications in
the pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape.

### [198] [MultiSoundGen: Video-to-Audio Generation for Multi-Event Scenarios via SlowFast Contrastive Audio-Visual Pretraining and Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19999)
*Jianxuan Yang,Xiaoran Yang,Lipan Zhang,Xinyue Guo,Zhao Wang,Gongping Huang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出了MultiSoundGen框架，通过引入SlowFast对比音频视觉预训练(SF-CAVP)和AVP排序偏好优化(AVP-RPO)方法，解决了复杂多事件场景下视频到音频生成中的语义-时间对齐和音频质量问题，实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频到音频方法在复杂多事件场景下面临两个关键限制：1）难以精确对齐复杂语义信息和快速动态特征；2）基础训练缺乏对语义-时间对齐和音频质量的定量偏好优化，导致在杂乱多事件场景中集成生成质量不佳。

Method: 提出MultiSoundGen框架，包含两个关键创新：1）SF-CAVP - 具有统一双流架构的音频视觉预训练模型，显式对齐音频视觉数据的核心语义表示和快速动态特征；2）AVP-RPO - 将直接偏好优化引入V2A领域，使用SF-CAVP作为奖励模型来量化和优先考虑关键语义-时间匹配，同时提升音频质量。

Result: 实验表明MultiSoundGen在多事件场景中实现了最先进的性能，在分布匹配、音频质量、语义对齐和时间同步方面取得了全面增益。

Conclusion: MultiSoundGen通过创新的SF-CAVP和AVP-RPO方法有效解决了复杂多事件场景下的V2A生成挑战，为音频视觉对齐和生成质量提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current video-to-audio (V2A) methods struggle in complex multi-event
scenarios (video scenarios involving multiple sound sources, sound events, or
transitions) due to two critical limitations. First, existing methods face
challenges in precisely aligning intricate semantic information together with
rapid dynamic features. Second, foundational training lacks quantitative
preference optimization for semantic-temporal alignment and audio quality. As a
result, it fails to enhance integrated generation quality in cluttered
multi-event scenes. To address these core limitations, this study proposes a
novel V2A framework: MultiSoundGen. It introduces direct preference
optimization (DPO) into the V2A domain, leveraging audio-visual pretraining
(AVP) to enhance performance in complex multi-event scenarios. Our
contributions include two key innovations: the first is SlowFast Contrastive
AVP (SF-CAVP), a pioneering AVP model with a unified dual-stream architecture.
SF-CAVP explicitly aligns core semantic representations and rapid dynamic
features of audio-visual data to handle multi-event complexity; second, we
integrate the DPO method into V2A task and propose AVP-Ranked Preference
Optimization (AVP-RPO). It uses SF-CAVP as a reward model to quantify and
prioritize critical semantic-temporal matches while enhancing audio quality.
Experiments demonstrate that MultiSoundGen achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance in multi-event scenarios, delivering comprehensive gains across
distribution matching, audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal
synchronization. The complete code and dataset will be released soon.

*Babak Naderi,Ross Cutler*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文比较了三种主观视频质量评估方法（ACR、ACR-HR、CCR）的统计效率、经济效率和决策一致性，发现ACR-HR在速度和成本效益上最优，但存在尺度压缩问题，而CCR对超出参考质量的改进更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在众包主观视频质量评估中，实践者需要在ACR、ACR-HR和CCR三种方法之间做出选择，但缺乏系统的比较研究来指导选择。

Method: 进行了P.910标准兼容的并行比较研究，使用15个说话人视频源，应用多种现实降质处理，并在720p和1080p分辨率下进行比特率阶梯任务评估。

Result: ACR-HR和ACR在条件级别强相关，CCR对超出参考质量的改进更敏感；ACR-HR速度约快两倍且成本效益更高，但存在尺度压缩问题；不同方法会影响饱和点和比特率阶梯推荐。

Conclusion: 研究为实践者提供了何时使用每种测试方法的实用指导，强调需要根据具体评估目标选择合适的方法。

Abstract: In crowdsourced subjective video quality assessment, practitioners often face
a choice between Absolute Category Rating (ACR), ACR with Hidden Reference
(ACR-HR), and Comparison Category Rating (CCR). We conducted a P.910-compliant,
side-by-side comparison across six studies using 15 talking-head sources of
good and fair quality, processed with realistic degradations (blur, scaling,
compression, freezing, and their combinations), as well as a practical
bitrate-ladder task at 720p and 1080p resolutions. We evaluated statistical
efficiency (standard deviations), economic efficiency, and decision agreement.
Our results show that ACR-HR and ACR correlate strongly at the condition level,
while CCR is more sensitive-capturing improvements beyond the reference.
ACR-HR, however, exhibits compressed scale use, particularly for videos with
fair source quality. ACR-HR is approximately twice as fast and cost-effective,
with lower normalized variability, yet the choice of quality measurement method
shifts saturation points and bitrate-ladder recommendations. Finally, we
provide practical guidance on when to use each test method.

*Zongyi Li,Junchuan Zhao,Francis Bu Sung Lee,Andrew Zi Han Yee*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: InconVAD是一个两阶段框架，用于检测跨模态的情感不一致性，在VAD空间中通过不确定性感知模型和选择性融合机制提升情感分析的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖不完整的情感表示并使用无条件融合，在模态不一致时性能下降，且缺乏专门的不一致性检测机制。

Method: 第一阶段使用独立的不确定性感知模型获得稳健的单模态预测；第二阶段通过分类器识别跨模态不一致性并选择性整合一致信号。

Result: 大量实验表明InconVAD在多模态情感不一致性检测和建模方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为情感分析提供了更可靠和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting emotional inconsistency across modalities is a key challenge in
affective computing, as speech and text often convey conflicting cues. Existing
approaches generally rely on incomplete emotion representations and employ
unconditional fusion, which weakens performance when modalities are
inconsistent. Moreover, little prior work explicitly addresses inconsistency
detection itself. We propose InconVAD, a two-stage framework grounded in the
Valence/Arousal/Dominance (VAD) space. In the first stage, independent
uncertainty-aware models yield robust unimodal predictions. In the second
stage, a classifier identifies cross-modal inconsistency and selectively
integrates consistent signals. Extensive experiments show that InconVAD
surpasses existing methods in both multimodal emotion inconsistency detection
and modeling, offering a more reliable and interpretable solution for emotion
analysis.
